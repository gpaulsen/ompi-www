    This is recycled e-mail from about 1.5 months ago.&nbsp; I observed this
    problem again.&nbsp; That is, if one queries the MTT database, certain
    results are reported twice.<br>
    <br>
    The date range in question is 2012/02/23 from about 08:48 to 09:02.&nbsp;
    The submitting system is once again ^burl-ct-v20z-2$.&nbsp; The problem
    is once again with v1.5 testing and with intel-64 tests.&nbsp; On the
    client side, the log seems to indicate that each result is submitted
    once.&nbsp; If I query the database, however, it shows a number of
    results reported twice.&nbsp; These incidents are consecutive -- that is,
    the behavior starts at some time and ends at another.<br>
    <br>
    Even if no one has time to figure this out, I figured I'd report
    this for the record books.<br>

      <div>Let us know if you notice further problems like this. I won't
        have time to look into them in the near term, but I'll try to
        put in on the short list to get to when I get free cycles. If
        you happen to come across a repeater scenario (not likely since
        this seems like something difficult to&nbsp;reproduce) that would
        help the debugging effort.<br>

              Sorry, I don't understand where to check.&nbsp; I do know that
              if I look at the output from the MTT client, I see a bunch
              of messages like this:<br>
              <br>
              &gt;&gt; Reported to MTTDatabase client: 1 successful
              submit, 0 failed submits (total of 6 results)<br>
              <br>
              If I add up those numbers of results submitted, the totals
              match what I would expect.&nbsp; So, there is some indication
              that the number of client submissions is right.

              I haven't either, but I only just started looking more
              closely at results.&nbsp; Mostly, in any case, things look
              fine.

                        I get more tests (passing and skipped) with v1.5
                        than I do with the trunk run. &nbsp;I have lots of
                        ways of judging what the numbers should be. The
                        "trunk" numbers are right. &nbsp;The "v1.5" numbers
                        are too high; &nbsp;they should be the same as the
                        trunk numbers.<br>
                        <br>
                        I can see the explanation by clicking on
                        "Detail" and looking at individual runs. &nbsp;(To
                        get time stamps, I add a " | by minute"
                        qualifier before clicking on "Detail". &nbsp;Maybe
                        there's a more proper way of getting time
                        stamps, but that seems to work for me.)
                        &nbsp;Starting with record 890 and ending with 991,
                        records are repeated. &nbsp;That is, 890 and 891 have
                        identical command lines, time stamps, output,
                        etc. &nbsp;One of them is a duplicate. &nbsp;Same with 892
                        and 893, then for 894 and 895, then 896 and 897,
                        and so on. &nbsp;So, for about a one-hour period, the
                        records sent in by this test run appear
                        duplicated when I submit queries to the
                        database. These 51 duplicates are the 45 extra
                        passes and 6 extra skips seen in the results
                        above.<br>
                        <br>
                        Can someone figure out what's going wrong here?
                        &nbsp;Clearly, I'd like to be able to rely on query
                        results.<br>
