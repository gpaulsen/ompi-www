  <tt>I considered possibility to use cookie when issue was found out.
But looking google documentation I could not understand if it solved
this issue. So it require additional investigation that I do not have
now. I will look in this way closer but current quick solutions were
suggested in mail.<br>
Now we have information about issue and know ways to workaround them.<br>

Alternatively, doesn't a Google login return a cookie of some flavor that is valid for a long period of time (somewhere between 1 day and 2 weeks)?  Can't we keep/cache that cookie down in the MTT client and use it for subsequent data submissions until the cookie expires and we have to login again?

      <pre wrap="">Description:
Issue arises during submitting data frequently. We can get failure during data submitting with authentication error.

Reason:
Google allows a failure response on The ClientLogin authorization process with a CAPTCHA challenge means that Google has decided, for whatever reason, that additional security measures should be taken. This response is accompanied by a CAPTCHA image URL and a token representing the specific CAPTCHA challenge.
I do not see way to organize customer input in this case.

Possible solutions:
1. catch error condition on server side and return status 503: 'Service Unavailable';
In this case client can organize processing of this failure (it is possible that sleeping for some time could help)
2. catch error condition on server side and accept authentication by correct username only w/o real verification;
3. rollback to previous scheme;

        <pre wrap="">Hi Jeff,

I am sending patch that enable google account approach to submit data to MTT GDS.
It also has the fix to a bug in displaying table as respond to bquery.pl --view (It has not been committed yet to MTT trunk).

As for question relating "how does one develop ..." that source information can be found at following location as: <a
 moz-do-not-send="true" class="moz-txt-link-freetext"
 href="http://svn.open-mpi.org/svn/mtt/trunk/docs/gds/VBench_GDS_Setup.doc">http://svn.open-mpi.org/svn/mtt/trunk/docs/gds/VBench_GDS_Setup.doc</a>.
In case you make a resolve to accept patch I am sending next steps should be done:

1. update application on server side using instruction in VBench_GDS_Setup.doc (topic 4 "Installation")
example: appcfg.py update &lt;local folder with open-mpi-mtt&gt;/
2. change version on <a moz-do-not-send="true"
 class="moz-txt-link-freetext"
 href="https://appengine.google.com/deployment?&amp;app_id=open-mpi-mtt&amp;version_id=1.337140739868725607">https://appengine.google.com/deployment?&amp;app_id=open-mpi-mtt&amp;version_id=1.337140739868725607</a> from 1 to 2 (make default)
note: after this operation all users that attempt to submit data using previous scheme of authentication will get failure respond.
3. go to open-mpi-mtt and add new users with google account


Regards,
Igor
