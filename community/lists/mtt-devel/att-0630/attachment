&gt; after patch, it killed child processes but kept mpirun ... itself.<br>
<br>
</div>What does that mean -- are you saying that mpirun is still running?  Was mpirun sent a signal at all?  What kind of messages are being displayed?  ...etc.<br>
<br>
The commits fix important bugs for me and others.  Clearly, there&#39;s still something not right.  And of course I&#39;m willing to track it down.  But I can&#39;t help you if you just say &quot;it doesn&#39;t work.&quot;<br>

<div class=""><br>
&gt; before that patch - all processes were killed (and you are right, &quot;mpirun died right at the end of the timeout&quot; was reported)<br>
<br>
</div>...which led to many months of misleading ORTE debugging, BTW.  :-\  That&#39;s why this commit was introduced into MTT -- in the quest of finally fixing both the mysterious ORTE hangs and the erroneous timeouts/&quot;mpirun died right at the end&quot; messages.<br>

<div class=""><br>
&gt; but at least it left the cluster in the clean state w/o leftovers.<br>
&gt; now many &quot;orphan&quot; launchers  are alive from previous invocations.<br>
<br>
</div>Does &quot;launchers&quot; = mpirun?<br>
