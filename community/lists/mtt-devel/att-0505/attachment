Thanks guys!  And sorry for my long lack of response - I was working in a window of availability for MTT stuff before, and then that window closed and I got sucked into other high priority things.  I have another small window of availability for MTT now...

It looks like Mike D. committed this stuff to SVN already, right?  If so, great!

Ok, I'll dig into that.

One thing that is quite confusing is the sign in to <a
 moz-do-not-send="true" class="moz-txt-link-freetext"
 href="http://open-mpi-mtt.appspot.com/">http://open-mpi-mtt.appspot.com/</a>.  When you go there, you get a "Sign in or register" link.  You click that and get to a Google Accounts login.  I used <a
 moz-do-not-send="true" class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated"
 href="mailto:openmpi.cisco@gmail.com">openmpi.cisco@gmail.com</a> and its associated password, but then I'm bounced back to the "Sign in or register" link.

Only when I login as <a moz-do-not-send="true"
 class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:openmpi@gmail.com">openmpi@gmail.com</a> do I actually get beyond the "Sign in or register" link.

Does this mean that <a moz-do-not-send="true"
 class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:openmpi.cisco@gmail.com">openmpi.cisco@gmail.com</a> does not have login privlidges on the open-mpi-mtt appspot?  If so, can we add a better error message than this?  It's very confusing -- because you *are* apparently signing in to a google account properly, but then you just get the "Sign in or register" link again.

  <pre>[ii] As I mentioned in previous mails current form of web-site suits administrating purpose mostly (to fit full multiuser access it should be provided additional
operations). So I knowingly limited admission for administrator only as "openmpi" to avoid additional questions in multiuser usage.

      <pre wrap="">In case you make a resolve to accept patch I am sending next steps should be done:

1. update application on server side using instruction in VBench_GDS_Setup.doc (topic 4 "Installation")
example: appcfg.py update &lt;local folder with open-mpi-mtt&gt;/
2. change version on <a moz-do-not-send="true"
 class="moz-txt-link-freetext"
 href="https://appengine.google.com/deployment?&amp;app_id=open-mpi-mtt&amp;version_id=1.337140739868725607">https://appengine.google.com/deployment?&amp;app_id=open-mpi-mtt&amp;version_id=1.337140739868725607</a> from 1 to 2 (make default)
note: after this operation all users that attempt to submit data using previous scheme of authentication will get failure respond.
3. go to open-mpi-mtt and add new users with google account

It looks like this was all done already -- probably because I took so long to reply.

Thanks!
