<div dir="ltr"><br><br>Hello guys,<br><br><br>I`m looking for a way having automatic regression report at the end of mtt run which include graph+table for bw/lat/2way-bw for this specific run as well as for previous runs on the same configuration.<br>
<br><br>The way we are doing it, is generating dynamic query for MTT test reporter at the end of mtt run, fetching html, extracting .png files with graphs and attaching it to the final MTT report.<br><br>During this process we observe the following:<br>
<br>The MTT database hosted at <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/mtt/index.php">http://www.open-mpi.org/mtt/index.php</a> behaves in very inconsistent way:<br><br>it work very sllllloooowwwwwww, sometimes it takes 5-10min to get query results<br>
We get many SQL errors during querying the performance results<br>Sometimes we get no performance graphs for historic searches (queried by date range, like &quot;past 6 month&quot;)<br><br>So, I`m wondering if someone else using this feature (generate performance results for historic runs) for similar goals and have better experience with it or recommendations?<br>
Will it behave better if we create a local copy of Mtt database?<br>Can we connect to MTT database hosted at <a href="http://www.openmpi.org">www.openmpi.org</a> with SQL directly?<br>For how long historic results are kept in the MTT database?<br>
