Just a quick heads-up: I brought over to the trunk the changes we did to support the testing of the CIFTS FTB (Fault tolerance Backplane).<br>The INI file (samples/ftb.ini) and the corresponding MTT::MPI::Install::FTB module might be helpful for those who want to use MTT to test other middleware.<br>
<br>Thanks,<br>Abhishek<br>
