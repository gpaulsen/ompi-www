    Sorry, I don't understand where to check.&nbsp; I do know that if I look
    at the output from the MTT client, I see a bunch of messages like
    this:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt; Reported to MTTDatabase client: 1 successful submit, 0
    failed submits (total of 6 results)<br>
    <br>
    If I add up those numbers of results submitted, the totals match
    what I would expect.&nbsp; So, there is some indication that the number
    of client submissions is right.<br>

    I haven't either, but I only just started looking more closely at
    results.&nbsp; Mostly, in any case, things look fine.<br>

            Org: Oracle<br>
            Platform name: $burl-ct-v20z-2$<br>
            Suite: intel-64<br>
            <br>
            and I get:<br>
            <br>
            1 oracle burl-ct-v20z-2 i86pc SunOS ompi-nightly-trunk
            1.7a1r25692 intel-64 4 870 0 86 0 0<br>
            2 oracle burl-ct-v20z-2 i86pc SunOS ompi-nightly-v1.5
            1.5.5rc2r25683 intel-64 4 915 0 92 0 0<br>
            <br>
            I get more tests (passing and skipped) with v1.5 than I do
            with the trunk run. &nbsp;I have lots of ways of judging what the
            numbers should be. The "trunk" numbers are right. &nbsp;The
            "v1.5" numbers are too high; &nbsp;they should be the same as the
            trunk numbers.<br>
            <br>
            I can see the explanation by clicking on "Detail" and
            looking at individual runs. &nbsp;(To get time stamps, I add a "
            | by minute" qualifier before clicking on "Detail". &nbsp;Maybe
            there's a more proper way of getting time stamps, but that
            seems to work for me.) &nbsp;Starting with record 890 and ending
            with 991, records are repeated. &nbsp;That is, 890 and 891 have
            identical command lines, time stamps, output, etc. &nbsp;One of
            them is a duplicate. &nbsp;Same with 892 and 893, then for 894
            and 895, then 896 and 897, and so on. &nbsp;So, for about a
            one-hour period, the records sent in by this test run appear
            duplicated when I submit queries to the database. These 51
            duplicates are the 45 extra passes and 6 extra skips seen in
            the results above.<br>
            <br>
            Can someone figure out what's going wrong here? &nbsp;Clearly,
            I'd like to be able to rely on query results.<br>
