<br>
There have been some off list e-mails and some in-person discussions about a fascinating idea that looks promising here.<br>
<br>
How about moving the MTT data store to the Google Apps Engine/datastore?  See here:<br>

<br>
Josh looked at this about a year ago and thought that there would be some interesting possibilities here, but never had the cycles to follow up on it.  Specifically: if we move all the MTT data from a postgres DB to the Google Apps datastore, we might have a highly scalable mechanism for queries, and therefore be able to do much more interesting kinds of queries (right now, we&#39;re fairly limited in our queries because of memory and CPU restrictions via Apache/PHP/jpgraph/etc., and also because <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org" target="_blank">www.open-mpi.org</a> is used for other server purposes).  So moving the data to the Google Apps datastore *could* give us a better underlying platform.<br>



<br>
A further thought is that perhaps we should roll up all the pending ideas we have for MTT (and there are a lot of them ;-) -- to include the one described above) and apply for a Google Summer of Code student.<br>

GSoC applications can be submitted March 9-13 2009.  This sounds like it could be a winner...<br>

&gt;&gt; Should we allow direct postgres connections (across the internet)<br>

&gt; It is possible that we could allow read-only access to specific<br>
&gt; organizations. I would be extremely careful about granting write<br>
&gt; access.<br>
<br>
Agreed; I think we should only allow read-only to specific IP addresses.<br>
<br>
It sounds like this *might* solve some of the issues (assuming they<br>
want to take the time to figure out the schema).  Should we explore<br>
this possibility?<br>
<br>
(the SQL schemas are in the MTT SVN repo, if you didn&#39;t know that<br>
already)<br>
