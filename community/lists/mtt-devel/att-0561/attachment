Hello,<br><br>While working towards setting up MTT to test the CIFTS FTB middleware, we resorted to a TextFile + Email reporter; largely because i) the frequency of testing is low ii) lesser number of tests and iii) we did not want to deal with setting up a centralized infrastructure to host the test results.<br>
<br>The reporter worked great for us except that we wanted a little more than just the summary. The attached patch adds a new boolean flag &quot;email_detailed_reports&quot; which sends out the detailed reports of each phase as attachments. I have had to use two files from CPAN to encode the email as a multipart message. Right now only the *.txt files are attached but it could also be extend to send an HTML-formatted email with HTML attachments.<br>
<br>Do you think it looks okay to go in?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Abhishek<br>
