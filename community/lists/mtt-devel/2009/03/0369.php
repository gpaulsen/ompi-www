<p>Yes, it probably would.  My understanding of hadoop (which is very  
<br>
highlevel) is that just dump everything in without too much concern  
<br>
about the structure / &quot;schema&quot;.  But I could be wrong on that.

<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt; The Google Apps account is under my personal Google account, so I'm
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; reluctant to use it. I think the reason it took so long for me, was
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; because when I originally signed up it was in limited beta. I think
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; the approval time is much shorter now (maybe a day?), and we can make
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; an openmpi or mtt account that we can use.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; With regard to Hadoop, I don't think that IU has a set of machines
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; that would work, but I can ask around. We could always try Hadoop on
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; a single machine if people wanted to play around with data querying/
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; storage.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't have a strong preference either way, but Google Apps may
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; provide us with a lower overhead solution for the long run even
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; though it costs $$.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<p><p>It looks like there is a set that you can use for free.  When you go  
<br>
over one of several metrics (CPU hours/day, storage, bandwidth in,  
<br>
bandwidth out, etc.), then you have to start paying.  But even with  
<br>
that, the costs look *quite* reasonable and should be easily covered  
<br>
by the combined Open MPI organizations (I'm talking hundreds of  
<br>
dollars here, not tens of thousands).
