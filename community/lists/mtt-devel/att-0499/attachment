&gt; &gt; 2. In reading through the Google Appengine docs, the GDS stuff looks like<br><div class="im">
&gt; we mainly can access the data through GQL.  I don&#39;t see any mention of doing<br>
&gt; map/reduce kinds of computations (Ethan and I were talking on the phone<br>
&gt; today about MTT Appengine possibilities).  I&#39;m new to all this stuff, so<br>
&gt; it&#39;s quite possible that a) I missed it, or b) I just don&#39;t understand what<br>
&gt; I&#39;m seeing/reading yet.  Or does GQL do map/reduce on the back end to do its<br>
&gt; magic?  Is GQL the main/only way we have to access GDS?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; As far as I and Igor know there are no way of doing Map/Reduce with GDS. And<br>
&gt; GQL (or filters which is practically synonym) is the main and only way to<br>
&gt; access GDS data.<br></div></blockquote></div><br><br>btw, afaik - the gds is using mapreduce explicitly on the backend - one needs do nothing in order to ENABLE it: just use their API and the framework will do the rest.<br>
