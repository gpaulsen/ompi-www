<div dir="ltr"><br>Hello Guys,<br>Please suggest the proper way to handle the following:<br><br>Is there any way to run &quot;test run&quot; section with a list of &quot;mpi_details&quot; sections? <br><br>Or how to execute specific &quot;Test run&quot; section against specific &quot;mpi_details&quot; section, where &quot;mpi_details&quot; can have many different scenarios of command line parameters (i.e. single mpi_details should be executed a number of times equal to the number of available scenarios for this mpi_details)? Is that possible? (it is similar to the @np param treatment available inside mpi_details section)<br>
<br><br><br>Thanks<br><br>Mike.<br></div>
