<div dir="ltr">Hello guys,<br><br>I`m not sure if we should preserve current DB schema, from one simple reason - datastore is an object oriented storage and have different rules and techniques then rdbms.<br>The basic storage unit in the datastore is an object which can be saved, loaded and queried.<br>

Yeah I think this sounds like a good way to move forward with this<br>
work. The database schema is pretty complex. If you need help on the<br>
database side of things let me know.<br>
<br>
To get started, would it be useful to have a meeting over the phone/<br>
telepresence to design the datastore layout? This gives us an<br>
opportunity to start from a blank slate with regards to the<br>
datastore, so it may be useful brainstorm a bit beforehand.<br>

Yes, it probably would.  My understanding of hadoop (which is very highlevel) is that just dump everything in without too much concern about the structure / &quot;schema&quot;.  But I could be wrong on that.<div class="im">

The Google Apps account is under my personal Google account, so I&#39;m<br>
reluctant to use it. I think the reason it took so long for me, was<br>
because when I originally signed up it was in limited beta. I think<br>
the approval time is much shorter now (maybe a day?), and we can make<br>
an openmpi or mtt account that we can use.<br>
<br>
With regard to Hadoop, I don&#39;t think that IU has a set of machines<br>
that would work, but I can ask around. We could always try Hadoop on<br>
a single machine if people wanted to play around with data querying/<br>
storage.<br>
<br>
I don&#39;t have a strong preference either way, but Google Apps may<br>
provide us with a lower overhead solution for the long run even<br>
though it costs $$.<br>

It looks like there is a set that you can use for free.  When you go over one of several metrics (CPU hours/day, storage, bandwidth in, bandwidth out, etc.), then you have to start paying.  But even with that, the costs look *quite* reasonable and should be easily covered by the combined Open MPI organizations (I&#39;m talking hundreds of dollars here, not tens of thousands).<div>
