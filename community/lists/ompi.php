<p> Due to the ever-present problem of spam, we cannot accept posts
from non-subscribers.  If you are not subscribed <?php red("with the
address that you post from"); ?>, you posts will be automatically
discarded.</p>

<p>Please note that our mailing lists have a <strong>150 KB</strong>
message size limit.  If you need to send an attachment that makes your
overall message be over that size, please post it elsewhere on the
internet and then just send a link to it across our lists.</p>

<P>The following lists are available for the Open MPI community:</p>

<P>
<UL>

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------->

<?php print_link("Open MPI announcement list (<font color=red>USERS
CANNOT POST TO THIS LIST</font>)", "announce"); ?>

<P> This is a low-volume list that is used to announce new version of
Open MPI, important updates, etc.  The list is only for announcements,
so <strong>only the Open MPI development team can post to the
list.</strong> Posts from outside the Open MPI development team will
be automatically discarded.</p>

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------->

<?php print_link("User list", "users"); ?>

<P>This list is used for general questions and discussion of Open MPI.
Please see the "<a href="<?php printf("$topdir/community/help/");
?>">Getting Help</a>" page for details on submitting requests for
help.  <?php red("Subscribers"); ?> can post questions, comments,
suspected bug reports, etc. to the list at the following address:</p>

<?php print_list("users"); ?>

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------->

<?php print_link("Development list", "devel"); ?>

<P>This list is used for developers who are working with the internals
of Open MPI itself.  <?php red("Subscribers"); ?> are welcome to post
any topics dealing with the internal code of Open MPI are welcome on
this list: questions, comments, bug reports, etc.</p>

<p>Note that the Open MPI team uses this mailing list as <em>one of
many</em> different types of communication about development.  We also
have a weekly engineering teleconference, we heavily use instant
messenging between developers, and we use regular ol' phone calls,
too.  Meaning: you shouldn't expect to see <em>all</em> development
discussion on this list.</p>

<?php print_list("devel"); ?>

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------->

<?php print_link("Packagers list", "ompi-packagers"); ?>

<P>This list is for downstream packagers who develop, distribute, and
maintain Open MPI as a software package (e.g., for Linux
distributions).  <?php red("Subscribers"); ?> are welcome to post any
topics dealing with platform support, packaging details, dependencies,
etc.</p>

<?php print_list("ompi-packagers"); ?>

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------->

<?php print_link("Git commit list (<font
color=red>USERS CANNOT POST TO THIS LIST</font>)", "ompi-commits"); ?>

<p>A mail is sent to this list for every Git push to Github commit in
the Open MPI code base.  The mail includes a list of files that were
changed, the developer's commit message, and a diff of the changes.
<strong>Only the automated git-email-bot can post to this
list;</strong> all other posts are automatically discarded.
