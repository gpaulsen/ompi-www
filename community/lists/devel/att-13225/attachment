&gt;&gt; how it is differ from other related stuf kept in svn to support:<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; - rpm based distros? (dist/linux/)<br>
&gt;&gt; - macos (contrib/dist/macosx-pkg/)<br>
&gt;&gt; - __debian_stuff_could_be_here_as_well<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; That&#39;s a fair point - I&#39;ll let the folks who added those directories chime in as to their views on the difference, if any - I think some of those may be historical and quite stale (i.e., they may only be there because we forgot they existed)<br>

<br>
</div>The RPM stuff that is there is for the official SRPM that is distributed on <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org" target="_blank">www.open-mpi.org</a>.  This SRPM is not used by any distro -- it is used by users.  Distros have their own, very customized, RPMs for Open MPI.<br>

<br>
The Mac OS X package is defunct and should probably be removed.  But it was also used by users to install/uninstall Open MPI because OS X never provided one themselves.<br>
<br>
However, both of these are distinguished by the fact that Debian has a strong, community-involved Open MPI package maintainer (Sylvestre Ledru &lt;<a href="mailto:sylvestre@debian.org">sylvestre@debian.org</a>&gt;, who has already replied on these threads).  It seems weird for us to supplant his package for no reason -- is this new OMPI Debian package better than his for some reason?  I.e., what is the exact motivation for this new Debian package?  No information has been provided on this front, which makes me very leery of it.<br>
