<br>
Don&#39;t know why it suddenly came up but in 1.8.1 we added a inline send<br>
optimization to the MPI_Isend path. The optimization uses the btl_sendi<br>
function to get the fragment on the wire without allocating a send<br>
request. If this fails the btl fragment returned by sendi is released<br>
with btl_free, a send request is allocated, and the normal send path is<br>
used. The optimization was tested with the openib btl so I don&#39;t know<br>
why this wasn&#39;t caught earlier. My guess is some other change may have<br>
triggered it.<br>
<br>
We fixed the bug in 1.8.4 by totally disabling message coalescing. The<br>
feature is meant to game the osu_mbw_mr test and does next to nothing<br>
for real apps. Additionally, the inline send optimization makes the<br>
feature less of a win with osu_mbw_mr anyway. We beat mvapich handily on<br>
LANL systems without message coalescing.</blockquote><div><br></div><div>[josh] Can you point to the PR, Nathan? I didn&#39;t realize this was already addressed in the 1.8.4 prerelease. I would seek Howard&#39;s guidance as to whether this is an acceptable solution for LANL.  Regardless of your opinion about the utility of MC, real decisions are made on the basis of those benchmarks, so I&#39;m not entirely convinced of your argument here.  OMPI, as we are all aware tends to be a target on the basis of these comparisons. </div><div><br></div><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex">

For master I have a fix that allows the message coalescing feature to<br>
remain on. This fix will come over with the btl changes. I may backport<br>
this fix to 1.8.5 as it fixes another long standing bug with message<br>
coalescing.<br>
