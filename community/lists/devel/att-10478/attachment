I took a closer look at this, and I think we&#39;re getting ourselves confused by the rather large differences between what is on the trunk vs the 1.5 branch. The trunk is doing the &quot;am I bound&quot; calculation correctly - it gets the cpubind bitmask and compares it to the allowed/available cpus.<br>
<br>The 1.5 branch has a problem. Jeff and I discussed it a little more, and agreed that I will create a minimal patch to address the issue of direct-launched procs. We definitely don&#39;t want to back-port the logic from the trunk.<br>
<br>Will try to have something next week.<br><br><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Fri, Feb 17, 2012 at 6:03 AM, Jeff Squyres <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:jsquyres@cisco.com">jsquyres@cisco.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br>

&gt; Could you please move it to v1.5 (do I need to fill a CMR)?<br>
<br>
</div>Just to clarify - you&#39;re asking for the patch to set WHOLE_SYSTEM when we load the hwloc topology, right?<br>
<br>
If so, please file a CMR.  Note that there&#39;s some differences between how hwloc is used between the trunk and the v1.5 branch; the same commit may not apply exactly from the trunk to v1.5.<br>
