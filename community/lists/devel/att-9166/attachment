<blockquote style="margin:0 0 0 40px;border:none;padding:0px"><div>When the proc restarts, it calls orte_routed.init_routes. If you look in routed cm, you should see a call to &quot;register_sync&quot; - this is where the proc sends a message to the local daemon, allowing it to &quot;learn&quot; the port/address where the proc resides.</div>

I had a problem because when i called init_routes, i was setting only the<b> orte_process_info.my_daemon</b> value to the new one, but i forgot to set the <b>orte_process_info.my_daemon_uri. </b>So when in init_routes the </font><b>orte_rml_base_parse_uris </b>was called this resets the value to the old daemon, but now that&#39;s ok.<div>

<div><br></div><div>But i&#39;ve got a little question about the sync. This allows the local daemon to learn about the new proc, but the other procs also learn about this? I mean, what happens if someone try to send a message to the restored process? This message is sent to his new location, or i will have to do something else to make this known to the others?</div>
