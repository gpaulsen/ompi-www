    <pre wrap="">You might be running the job under Valgrind or another debugger, bclr has some issues with fork as I remember and traditionally there have been IB mapping issues here as well.  I'm sure you could make a case against any of those points if you wanted to but I think the argument stands, doing this kind of run-time check shouldn't be needed.

Mmm; good points (especially Valgrind).  BLCR and OpenFabrics verbs shouldn't be much of an issue here, but I can see that there might be unexpectedness if you're running under Valgrind or some other debugger.

Couldn't you also run into problems if a job is running under an RM
that is enforcing a number of processes limit on the job?<br>

That's how most of the network transports are in OMPI today -- if they fail to init, they are just skipped.

The problem here is that you really need 2 processes to do this test.  I suppose it could be done with local ranks 0 and 1 instead of forking a new process -- they would just need to communicate via RML to sync up, I suppose.

    <pre wrap="">I should of course said fork where I mentioned spawn above to avoid any confusion, spawn has a specific meaning in the context of MPI.

I still think a better understanding of the issue is required before any decision here is made though, I'm surprised by Samuels description of the problem because it's not how I remember it and from what Chris says it doesn't reflect what is in linux Git code either.  I'd like to see why there is an apparent difference in behaviour before a decision is made to only support one.

There's no intent to only support sysv or mmap.  Samuel's work was to extend OMPI to support sysv in the case where it would be advantageous (e.g., guaranteed cleanup of the shmem segment).  The mmap stuff is definitely not going to be removed.
