Folks,<div><br></div><div>I noticed several errors such as <a href="http://mtt.open-mpi.org/index.php?do_redir=2244">http://mtt.open-mpi.org/index.php?do_redir=2244</a></div><div>that did not make any sense to me (at first glance)</div><div><br></div><div>I was able to attach one process when the issue occurs.</div><div>the sigsegv occurs in thread 2, while thread 1 is invoking ompi_rte_finalize.</div><div><br></div><div>All I can think is a scenario in which the progress thread (aka thread 2) is still dealing with some memory that was just freed/unmapped/corrupted by the main thread.</div><div><br></div><div>I empirically noticed the error is more likely to occur when there are many tasks on one node</div><div>e.g. mpirun --oversubscribe -np 32 a.out</div><div><br></div><div>Cheers,</div><div><br></div><div>Gilles<br><br></div>
