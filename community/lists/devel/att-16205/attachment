&gt; Hey Jeff,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; now we use only this &quot;--enable-mpi-thread-multiple&quot; and it worked.<br>
&gt; does it mean that now we need to pass &quot;--enable-mpi-thread-multiple --enable-opal-multi-threads&quot; to get it working again?<br>
&gt; Maybe if one of the params used it should enable another one as well?<br>
<br>
</span>I believe that that is the case.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind: this mess is cleaned up on the trunk; the threading options are simpler.  This is &quot;legacy&quot; now, on the v1.8 branch, and likely won&#39;t be updated.<br>
<br>
The change that happened recently was that THREAD_MULTIPLE support was accidentally enabled by default on the v1.8 branch (which wasn&#39;t intended).  The change a few days ago was to turn THREAD_MULTIPLE support off by default.<br>
