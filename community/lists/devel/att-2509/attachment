Hi Brian,<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some good news and bad news.
According to&nbsp; the information provided on
<a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=running">http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=running</a>, <br>
<br>
I have enabled X11Forward on all remote nodes, and <br>
added the path to mpirun, which is &quot;/usr/local/bin&quot;, on all node, and<br>
&nbsp;&quot;xhost +&quot; on my localhost, and  <br>
set the DISPLAY on all remote nodes as the DISPLAY value of my localhost. Then,<br>
&nbsp;I used &quot;mpirun -n [numberPros] --hostfile [filename] arg[0]
..&quot;&nbsp; to start the job on my localhost, it was still not working,<br>
<br>
&nbsp;But,&nbsp; when I explicitly added the &quot;--prefix /usr/local&quot; and
&quot;-x DISPLAY=[localDISPLAYvalue]&quot; to start the job, everything was
working: all xwindows opened by remote nodes were displayed on my
localhost machine. I was so excited! Moreover, with all these --prefix
and -x options to do mpirun through XGrid (i.e. without adding
--hostfile ) , it was still working!<br>
<br>
<br>
Could you please tell me what things that I missed in setting all
remote nodes as I mentioned in above, so I don&#39;t&nbsp; have to type all
the options to start this job?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;(I have also tried to add the prefix &quot;/usr/local&quot; to the PATH of
each remote node as well, it was still not working&nbsp; if
without&nbsp; --prefix option). <br><br>
Thanks for any help.<br>
<br>

XGrid does not forward X11 credentials, so you would have to setup an<br>X11 environment by yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp;Using ssh or a local starter does<br>forward X11 credentials, which is why it works in that case.<br><br>Brian<br><br>

i.e. XOpenDisplay()) to open an X window.&nbsp;&nbsp;The XOpenDisplay()<br>&gt; function call failed (return &quot;null&quot;), it can not open a display no<br>&gt; matter how many processors that I requested.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; However, when I tuned off the xgrid controller, I used &quot;mpirun -n 4
<br>&gt; &quot; to start the job again, four X windows opened properly, but four<br>&gt; processes were all running on the local machine instead of on any<br>&gt; remote nodes.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I have also tested to use &quot;ssh -x&quot; from a terminal of my local
<br>&gt; machine to login to any other node in the cluster&nbsp;&nbsp;to run the job<br>&gt; (I have the copies of the same job on all nodes and in the same<br>&gt; path), the X window can display on my local machine&nbsp;&nbsp;properly. I<br>
&gt; know it is &quot;-x&quot; option set up the environment properly for starting<br>&gt; the xwindow. If only use &quot;ssh&quot; without &quot;-x&quot; option, it won&#39;t work.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I am wondering why the xwindow can not open if the job is started
<br>&gt; through Xgrid.&nbsp;&nbsp;How does the Xgrid controller contact to each agent<br>&gt; node?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Is there anyone who has seen a similar problem?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I have installed X11 and OpenMPI on all 8 mac mini nodes in my
<br>&gt; cluster, and have also tested running an&nbsp;&nbsp;MPI job,&nbsp;&nbsp;which&nbsp;&nbsp;has no X<br>&gt; window function calls, through XGrid, it worked perfectly fine on<br>&gt; all nodes.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Thanks a lot for any suggestions!<br>
