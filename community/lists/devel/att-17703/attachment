The 1.8.7 tarball is incorrect - I grabbed the wrong one, and it is missing several commits. As if that isn’t enough, I’ve been informed that we also missed moving some critical fixes over to 1.8 in the MPI_Finalize area, and so users of PSM are getting segfaults. This is -not- related to the current 1.10 email thread regarding MTL segfaults on finalize in the 1.10 series - it’s a completely different problem, just the same result.</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">Jeff and I backtracked the problem, and I have created a PR that represents a first attempt at collecting the missing pieces. However, it clearly isn’t complete as it isn’t passing tests. So I need help in finding the rest of the missing pieces.</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">The PR for 1.10 on this issue is here:</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class=""><a href="https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi-release/pull/422" class="">https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi-release/pull/422</a></div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">The 1.8.8 one is here:</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class=""><a href="https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi-release/pull/423" class="">https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi-release/pull/423</a></div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">I would appreciate it if folks could help find the missing parts so we can correct the 1.8 situation, and help get 1.10 out the door.</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">Ralph</div><div class=""><br class=""></div></body></html>
