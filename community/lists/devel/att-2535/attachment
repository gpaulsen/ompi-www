Rich hopes to look into fixing the openib BTL problem today; he <BR>
thinks it's a case of a simple oversight: the openib BTL is not using <BR>
the new freelist init functions.<BR>
<BR>
Rich: are there other places that are not using the new init <BR>
functions that need to?<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt; the ompi free list has two init functions, I changed just one. &nbsp;The IB btl uses the<BR>
&gt;&gt; one I have not yet changed, but the pml uses the one I did change.<BR>
