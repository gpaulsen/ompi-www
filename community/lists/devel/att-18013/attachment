There are a handful of failures still being seen - most of them involving what appear to be unrelated code. I’m not entirely sure I understand the source of the errors, and could really use some help to determine (a) if these are in any way related to PMIx, and if so (b) how.</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">The errors from my MTT run are here: &nbsp;<a href="http://mtt.open-mpi.org/index.php?do_redir=2256" class="">http://mtt.open-mpi.org/index.php?do_redir=2256</a></div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">Any help diagnosing these problems would be greatly appreciated</div><div class="">Ralph</div><div class=""><br class=""></div></body></html>
