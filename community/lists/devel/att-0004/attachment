The day/time was never set that I know about. Cindy Sievers is still holding the room, but we do need to let her know ASAP the times when you want the system operational.<BR>

I ask because those of us involved in that meeting will need to reserve 
time on the Access Grid and coordinate with the remote sites for 
participation.

AFAIK, we have 2 remote sites, right?

- UTK, for Graham Fagg (and others?)
- ?? for Torsten (Torsten: you mentioned where before, but I don't 
recall the name of the site)

Are there others?</I></FONT></PRE>
