Reminder:<br>
  If you are interested in attending the May 3-5 Open MPI Developers Meeting at ORNL let let Rich (rlgraham -at- ornl -dot- gov) and I know as soon as possible so we can start the paperwork. This is of particular importance for non-US citizens since the paperwork takes considerably more time.<br>


<br>
<br>
The meeting will be three full days (May 3-5) on the ORNL campus. I intend to setup a teleconf for some/most of the sessions for those that cannot attend in person. Once we have the agenda topics on the table we can start negotiating time allotments.<br>


<br>
Below are the agenda items that I have gathered so far (in no particular order):<br>
 - MPI 2.2 implementation tickets<br>
 - MPI 3.0 implementation planning<br>
 - ORNL: Hierarchical Collectives discussion<br>
 - Runtime integration discussion<br>
 - New Process Affinity functionality<br>
 - Update on ORTE development<br>
 - Fault tolerance feature development and integration<br>
   (C/R, logging, replication, FT-MPI, MPI 3.0, message reliability, ...)<br>
<br>
Other topics that I thought of which folks might want to discuss - Is there anyone that wants to include these and lead their discussions?:<br>
 - Threading design<br>
 - Performance tuning (Point-to-point and/or Collective)<br>
 - Testing infrastructure (MTT)<br>
<br>
<br>
Keep sending agenda items to the list (or me directly if you would rather). I hope to have the agenda sketched out by the teleconf on 4/12 so we can fine tune it on the call.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
Josh<br>
