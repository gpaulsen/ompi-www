<div dir="ltr">Hi folks<div><br></div><div>After talking with Mike Dubman/Mellanox, we have clarified that the true urgency with respect to 1.10.2 is in getting PRs into that branch. Release of the official 1.10.2 tarball can occur a reasonable time later.</div><div><br></div><div>Accordingly, we are going to accept PRs into 1.10.2 at a little more rapid pace. So I&#39;ll be looking to commit PRs on a daily basis, gated by the cleanliness of the prior night&#39;s MTT results.</div><div><br></div><div>NOTE: IF you make a change to the MTT test suite, please send a note to devel alerting us to the change and pointing to the corresponding PR required to pass the test!!</div><div><br></div><div>We are still going to maintain 1.10.2 as a *bug fix* release - so please don&#39;t schedule new features for that milestone.</div><div><br></div><div>We think that official release of 1.10.2 will likely take place in Jan.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks</div><div>Ralph</div><div><br></div></div>
