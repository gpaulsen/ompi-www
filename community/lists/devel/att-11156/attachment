      <pre wrap="">To update everyone: there was much more discussion about this off-list.  :-)

We decided to do the following:

1. The name --with-verbs seems better than --with-openfabrics, if for no other reason than the name "openfabrics" encompasses more things than we intend with this name (e.g., udapl, psm, etc.).

2. There is a definite problem that needs to be fixed, but it is only partially related to the renaming.  Basically: the proposed option renaming is occurring opportunistically with this bug fix.

3. We are *not* renaming the openib BTL at this time.  It would be great if someone would do this in the future, hint hint!

4. The behavior of --with[out]-verbs is as was described in a prior mail:
  - if --with-verbs is specified, all 3 verbs-based components must succeed
  - if --without-verbs is specified, all 4 verbs-based components will not build
  - if --with-verbs=DIR is specified, all 3 verbs-based components must succeed and will use DIR to find verbs headers and libraries

    What does it mean that "all 3 verbs-based components must succeed"?&nbsp;
    <br>
    Does that mean you cannot specify --with-verbs=DIR --with-openib
    --without-ofud?<br>
    Does it mean that if you specify --with-verbs=DIR&nbsp; and some other
    dependency is not found for openib btl that the configure fails?<br>
    What is the 4th verbs-based component this is not built when one
    specifies --without-verbs.<br>

5. The new collectives / non-blocking collectives will likely revise some more configury in this area when it comes in mid/late next week, because a bunch of verbs stuff moved out of the openib BTL and into common.  Pasha and I will revisit this when all that stuff is merged in next week.

6. I'll be committing the current --with-verbs stuff right now in order to fix the bug that Brian is running in to.

I don't think that "verbs" is terrible, but I think that "openfabrics" has more user-level recognition.

For example, if you ask a customer what kind of network stack they have installed on their machine, they'll say "I have OFED installed".  They won't say "I have the verbs stack installed."
