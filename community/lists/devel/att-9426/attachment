    It has been on my to-do list for a while to start a FAQ listing of the various resilience/FT related activities in and around Open MPI. This would provide a starting location for users and new developers could go to for an overview of each of the features, and how to activate/use the feature.

    I'll try to bump that up the priority list and post a message once it is ready. Probably a month or so off since I need to collect some information from various developers.

        I think we're some ways away from declaring a "resilient ORTE". Josh and I have been committing pieces of it over the last two years, and Wes just committed another piece the other day that might have been titled "fault tolerant OOB" as it primarily addressed maintaining comm routing during node failures.
