Open MPI v1.3 is close to being ready for release. &nbsp;The remaining defects are being worked and our goal is to have those wrapped up and v1.3 officially released on December 9. &nbsp;Here is the schedule leading up to the final release:<div>
<br><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;December 2: RC1</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;December 5: RC2</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;December 9: 1.3 Release</div><div><br></div><div>This has been a long effort involving many developers and organizations and the release cycle has been frustratingly long, but after one more push, we should have this out the door. &nbsp;In order to help ensure the release goes smoothly, please take some time to download and do some basic sanity checks on the release candidates as they become available.</div>
