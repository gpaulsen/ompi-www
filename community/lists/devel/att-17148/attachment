      i was able to reproduce the issue when the external hwloc
      libraries are not<br>
      in the default lib path (e.g. /usr/lib64)<br>
      <br>
      a simple workaround is to<br>
      LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path_to_your_hwloc_lib configure ...<br>
      <br>
      /* libevent configure does compile a test program with
      -L/path_to_your_hwloc_lib -lhwloc,<br>
      and then tries to run the binary, but that fails since the library
      is not found.<br>
      on top of my head, possible fixes are :<br>
      a) invoke libevent configure with
      LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path_to_your_hwloc_lib<br>
      b) invoke libevent configure with
      LDFLAGS=-Wl,-rpath,/path_to_your_hwloc_lib<br>
      Cheers,<br>

      <pre wrap="">Ah, yes I am sorry. I can successfully configure if I do not define an
external hwloc, however the 'make all' fails. I must have not re-configured
it after trying that.

The correct config.log is there now. From what I could gather, the problem
is in this line(105):

When I try to run that file I get a segfault, although from what I can tell
there is not a problem during the hwloc installation(but it would seem that
I am wrong).
I have attached the correct config.log from
opal/mca/event/libevent2022/libevent,
the config.log from hwloc, and the output from the 'make install' of hwloc
Thanks,
Peter
