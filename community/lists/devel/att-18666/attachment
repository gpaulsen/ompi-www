I am just concerned that we are going to spend a bunch of time responding to annoyed/concerned users about this warning. Every time we ask someone to run a debug build to diagnose a problem, or someone builds a debug build for their own diagnostic purposes, they are going to get an unnecessary warning. We already have had to contend with the annoyed users dealing with auto-binding because we are trying to respond to the benchmarkers who refuse to make an effort to compare apples to apples - I would advise against extending that practice.<br>

I personally don’t mind having to explicitly enable-debug as I build from a platform file, but making it more convenient for those developers who don’t would be nice.<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt; what about *not* issuing this warning if OpenMPI is built from git ?<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; that would be friendlier for OMPI developers,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; and should basically *not* affect endusers, since they would rather build OMPI from a tarball.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; VPATH builds aren&#39;t debug builds by default, or are they?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Correct -- VPATH builds are *not* debug-by-default builds.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Just to be clear: the debug-by-default builds are activated when a .git directory is seen in the build directory.  This is for people who git clone and do a non-VPATH build.  Such people are typically developers.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; And just to make *that* more clear: building from a tarball will not have a .git directory, so you get an optimized build by default.<br>
