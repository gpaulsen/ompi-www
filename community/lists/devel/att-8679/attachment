I think the two efforts (the paffinity and this one) do overlap somewhat. I&#39;ve been writing the local topology discovery code for Jeff, Terry, and Josh - uses hwloc (or any other method - it&#39;s a framework) to discover what hardware resources are available on each node in the job so that the info can be used in mapping the procs.<div>
<br></div><div>As part of that work, we are passing down to the mpi processes the local hardware topology. This is done because of prior complaints when we had each mpi process discover that info for itself - it creates a bit of a &quot;storm&quot; on the node of large smp&#39;s.</div>
<div><br></div><div>Note that what I&#39;ve written (still to be completed before coming over) doesn&#39;t tell the proc what cores/HT&#39;s it is bound to - that&#39;s the part Terry et al are adding. Nor were we discovering the switch topology of the cluster.</div>
<div><br></div><div>So a little overlap that could be resolved. And a concern on my part: we have previously introduced capabilities that had every mpi process read local system files to get node topology, and gotten user complaints about it. We probably shouldn&#39;t go back to that practice.</div>

    A few comments:<br>
    <br>
    1.  Have you guys considered using hwloc for level 4-7 detection?<br>
    2.  Is L2 related to L2 cache?  If no then is there some other term
    you could use?<br>
    3.  What do you see if the process is bound to multiple
    cores/hyperthreads?<br>
    4.  What do you see if the process is not bound to any level 4-7
    items?<br>
    5.  What about L1 and L2 cache locality as some levels? (hwloc
    exposes these but these are also at different depths depending on
    the platform).<br>
    <br>
    Note I am working with Jeff Squyres and Josh Hursey on some new
    paffinity code that uses hwloc.  Though the paffinity code may not
    have direct relationship to hitopo the use of hwloc and
    standardization of what you call level 4-7 might help avoid some
    user confusions.<br>

      WHAT: Add a framework for hardware topology detection to be used
      by any other part of Open MPI to help optimization.
      <br>
      <br>
      WHY: Collective operations or shared memory algorithms among
      others may have optimizations depending on the hardware
      relationship between two MPI processes. HiTopo is an attempt to
      provide it in a unified manner.

      WHEN: When wanted.

==========================================================================
      <br>
      We developped the HiTopo framework for our collective operation
      component, but it may be useful for other parts of Open MPI, so
      we&#39;d like to contribute it.
      <br>
      <br>
      A wiki page has been setup :
      <br>
      <a href="https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/wiki/HiTopo" target="_blank">https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/wiki/HiTopo</a>
      <br>
      <br>
      and a bitbucket repository :
      <br>
      <a href="http://bitbucket.org/jeaugeys/hitopo/" target="_blank">http://bitbucket.org/jeaugeys/hitopo/</a>
      <br>
      <br>
      In a few words, we have 3 steps in HiTopo :
      <br>
      <br>
       - Detection : each MPI process detects its topology at various
      levels :
      <br>
          - core/socket : through the cpuid component
      <br>
          - node : through gethostname
      <br>
          - switch/island : through openib (mad) or slurm
      <br>
            [ Other topology detection components may be added for other
      <br>
              resource managers, specific hardware or whatever we want
      ...]
      <br>
      <br>
       - Collection : an allgather is performed to have all other
      processes&#39; addresses
      <br>
      <br>
       - Renumbering : &quot;string&quot; addresses are converted to numbers
      starting at 0 (Example : nodenames &quot;foo&quot; and &quot;bar&quot; are renamed 0
      and 1).
      <br>

      Any comment welcome,
      <br>
