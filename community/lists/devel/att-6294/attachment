Let me suggest a two-step process, then:<div><br></div><div>1. let&#39;s change the error message as this is easily done and thus can be done now</div><div><br></div><div>2. I can look at how to eat the rankfile as a hostfile. This may not even be possible - the problem is that the entire system is predicated on certain ordering due to our framework architecture.

<div><br></div><div>By the time we reach the rankfile mapper, we have already determined that we don&#39;t have an allocation and have to abort. It is the rankfile mapper itself that looks for the -rankfile option, so the system can have no knowledge that someone has specified that option before that point - and thus, even if I could parse the rankfile, I don&#39;t know it was given!</div>

<div><br></div><div>What will take time is to figure out a way to either:</div><div><br></div><div>(a) allow us to run the mapper even though we don&#39;t have any nodes we know about, and allow the mapper to insert the nodes itself - without causing non-rankfile uses to break (which could be a major feat); or</div>

<div><br></div><div>(b) have the overall system check for the rankfile option and pass it as a hostfile as well, assuming that a hostfile wasn&#39;t also given, no RM-based allocation exists, etc. - which breaks our abstraction rules and also opens a possible can of worms.</div>

<div><br></div><div>Either way, I also then have to teach the hostfile parser how to realize it is a rankfile format and convert the info in it into what we expected to receive from a hostfile - another non-trivial problem.</div>

<div><br></div><div>I&#39;m willing to give it a try - just trying to make clear why my response was negative. It isn&#39;t as simple as it sounds...which is why Len and I didn&#39;t pursue it when this was originally developed.</div>

Being a part of these discussions I can understand your reticence to reopen this discussion.  However, I think this is a major usability issue with this feature which actually is fairly important in order to get things to run performant. Which IMO is important.<br>


<br>
That being said I think there are one of two things that could be done to mitigate the issue.<br>
<br>
1.  To eliminate the element of surprise by changing mpirun to eat rankfile without the hostfile.<br>
2.  To change the error message to something understandable by the user such that they<br>
know they might be missing the hostfile option.<br>
<br>
Again I understand this topic is frustrating and there are some boundaries with the design that make these two option orthogonal to each other but I really believe we need to make the rankfile option something that is easily usable by our users.<br>

Having gone around in circles on hostfile-related issues for over five years now, I honestly have little motivation to re-open the entire discussion again. It doesn&#39;t seem to be that daunting a requirement for those who are using it, so I&#39;m inclined to just leave well enough alone.<br>

    This is the main part I&#39;m concerned about.  E.g.,<br>
<br>
    % cat rankfile<br>
    rank 0=node0 slot=0<br>
    rank 1=node1 slot=0<br>
    % mpirun -np 2 -rf rankfile ./a.out<br>

    Rankfile claimed host node1 that was not allocated or<br>
    oversubscribed it&#39;s slots:<br>

    0 on node0<br>
    1 on node1<br>
    done<br>
<br>
    It seems to me that the rankfile has sufficient information to<br>
    express what I want it to do.  But mpirun won&#39;t accept this.  To<br>
    fix this, I have to, e.g., supply/maintain/specify redundant<br>

    Right.  And my issue is that I&#39;m forced to use both when I only<br>

        In order to use &quot;mpirun --rankfile&quot;, I also need to specify<br>
        hosts/hostlist.  But that information is redundant with what<br>
        I provide in the rankfile.  So, from a user&#39;s point of view,<br>
        this strikes me as broken.  Yes?  Should I file a ticket, or<br>
