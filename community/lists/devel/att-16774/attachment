<div dir="ltr">I have some comments about this ticket and the corresponding patch. Honestly, the patch lacks most of the things we have talked about during our last developers meeting. However, my main concern in this particular email is about the SIGNAL flag. <div><br></div><div>1. The fact that currently there is little difference between this flag and PRIORITY is a fact that I would like to hear a justification for. </div><div><br></div><div>2. Moreover, right now SIGNAL is a purely PML decision. Again, we talked about this and decided that the upper layer (this meant whoever is using the PML) was to define this policy. We specifically said that this should not be a PML level decision, because the PML lacks the means to take the right decision about what should be signaled and what not. The current code signals most of the PML control logic, including some of the matching logic (but not all for some obscure reason). Based on my understanding of the code, one didn&#39;t need to pollute the PML code for this, it could have just used the PRIORITY flag instead.<div><br></div><div>Additionally, if my memory is good we decided that this should be thoughtfully evaluated before pushing it into the trunk. And here thoughtfully meant over multiple BTL and so on. Obviously, I missed the email thread about the evaluation of this flag on UGNI. I guess I might not be the only one, so I would really appreciate if someone can repost it again.</div><div><br></div><div>  George.<br></div><div><br></div></div></div>
