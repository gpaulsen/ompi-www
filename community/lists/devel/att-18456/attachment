    Marco,<br>
    <br>
    Thanks for the patch, i will apply the changes related to the
    missing include files to master and PR to v2.x<br>
    <br>
    on linux, libpmix.so does not depend on libopen-pal.<br>
    that being said, libpmix.so has undefined symbols related to hwloc
    and libevent, and these symbols are defined in libopen-pal.so<br>
    i assume that is ok with linux but cygwin does not accept it.<br>
    <br>
    an other way to do things (and generally speaking, that could become
    the way to go in a near future) is to use external hwloc and
    libevent (that assumes of course cygwin provides these libraries and
    versions meet the ompi requirements)<br>
    <br>
    could you try to<br>
    configure --with-hwloc=external --with-libevent=external ...<br>
    and see if it helps ?<br>
    <br>
    fwiw, with master you will soon be able to do the same thing with
    pmix<br>
    (e.g. configure --with-pmix=external ...)<br>
    <br>
    Cheers,<br>
    <br>

      Question:
      <br>
      - as pmix depends on hwloc and libevents, is it supposed to
      <br>
        link against opal shared lib, is it supposed to be included
      <br>
        in the opal shared lib or is it a circular dependency ?
      <br>
      <br>
      I solved the build changing from shared to convenience library.
      <br>
      <br>
      -lib_LTLIBRARIES = libpmix.la
      <br>
      +noinst_LTLIBRARIES = libpmix.la
      <br>
      <br>
      as circular dependency will be a hell to manage with the
      <br>
      no-undefined flag.
      <br>
      <br>
      The attached patch solves also
      <br>
      <br>
      - several lacks of declaration for opal_output functions
      <br>
        used in the ompi tree.
      <br>
        They also require libmpi link vs <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:lib@OPAL_LIB_PREFIX@open-pal.la">lib@OPAL_LIB_PREFIX@open-pal.la</a>
      <br>
      <br>
      - lack of declaration for several &lt;unistd.h&gt; functions
      <br>
        like access, gethostname, usleep, ..
      <br>
      <br>
      - add !defined(__CYGWIN__) on libevent2022/libevent/event.h
      <br>
        as for current 1.8 and 1.10 code.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Please also note that usleep is marked as obsolescent on
      <br>
      Open Group Base Specifications Issue 6
      <br>

      <br>
      and it is missing on Issue7
      <br>
      <br>
      With this patch it builds on cygwin 64 bit and passes the
      <br>
      same tests of 1.10.x code
