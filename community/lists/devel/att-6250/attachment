All:<div><br></div><div>We are close to releasing 1.3.3.  This is the current plan:</div><div>  - Evening of 6/16: collect MTT runs on the current branch w/the current 1.3.3 features &amp; fixes</div><div>  - If all goes well with the overnight MTT runs, roll a release candidate on 6/17</div>
<div>  - Put 1.3.3rc1 through its paces over the next couple of days</div><div>  - If all goes well with rc1, release 1.3.3 on Friday, June 19</div><div><br></div><div>1.3.3 will include support for Windows as its major new feature, as well as a number of defect fixes.</div>
<div><br></div><div>1.3.3 will be the final feature release in the 1.3 series.  As such, with the new feature/stable numbering</div><div>scheme, the next release in the series will contain defect fixes only and will transition to 1.4.  This</div>
<div>will be the stable/maintenance branch.  The plan is for it to follow the 1.3.3 release by a fairly short time</div><div>(4-6 weeks), and subsequent releases in the series will take place as need be depending on the bug</div>
<div>fix volume &amp; criticality.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks,</div><div>--brad</div><div>1.3/1.4 co-release mgr</div>
