<div>Hi.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The OMPI community should think to come with OpenMPI Internals document. Probably having an Internal document will certainly help developers of OpenMPI.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>What one has to do - if one is thinking to come with OMPI Internals document to start with? Is there any link or project repository within OMPI to start working on OMPI Internals document.</div>
