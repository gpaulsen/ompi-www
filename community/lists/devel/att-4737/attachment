Short version: OMPI now just &quot;figures it out&quot; and does the right thing.<div><span class="e" id="q_11cafe7e6b023de9_1"><br>

Actually, I thought about this one more, and I have concluded that we do *not* want to do this (i.e., allow RDMA CM to send requests for port A from port B. &nbsp;If we do this, then it would be possible that *all* traffic will go the &quot;wrong&quot; way. &nbsp;More specifically, OMPI will not have direct control over what traffic goes over what port -- and that would be Bad.<br>

<br>
So we&#39;ll still lookup the peer based on the address where the connect request came from, and I&#39;ll eventually add a FAQ item about it (because IP addressing is much more flexible than IB addressing, and netadmins may be tempted to use a &quot;flat&quot; address space).<br>

I actually spent all afternoon diagnosing something that I&#39;ll turn into a FAQ entry (OMPI&#39;s RDMA CM TCP addressing requirements are stronger than TCP&#39;s legal addressing rules). &nbsp;In short, OMPI needs the RDMA CM to guarantee that requests to connect to port A come from port A. &nbsp;If you have a &quot;flat&quot; network address space, RDMA CM may actually issue a connect request for port A from port B. &nbsp;This causes OMPI to get confused because it will not find the right BTL openib endpoint to connect to.<br>

And... crap. &nbsp;We can fix this one, too.<br>
<br>
Right now, we use the IP address from the incoming RDMA CM event ID to determine who the caller is. &nbsp;But we could easily embed the IP address (i.e., endpoint designator) in the private data in the event so that the peer can look at *that* address to identify who the peer is (rather than the address embedded in the event ID).<br>

<br>
This is actually what the IB CM CPC does, IIRC.<br>
<br>
Blah. &nbsp;This is also not hard, but it&#39;s another task for later. &nbsp;:-)<br>
