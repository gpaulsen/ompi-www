Dear OpenMPI developers,<br><br>I currently link my application with &quot;libmpi_f77d.dll&quot; which supposed to be a Fortran MPI library,<br>but when I load the application that a error message asking for &quot;msvcr100d.dll&quot; which does<br>
not exist in the installation path. &quot;msvcr100.dll&quot; does exist in the same directory, but does not<br>function correctly with linking. Could you fix this problem in the next release?<br><br>By the way, should &quot;libmpi_f77d.dll&quot; be &quot;libmpi_f77.dll&quot;?<br>
<br>Sincerely,<br>Wei-Chen Chen<br>
