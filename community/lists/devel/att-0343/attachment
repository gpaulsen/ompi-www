Yo folks<br><br>
Josh ran some tests for me on Odin earlier today - the results show a
major improvement in our startup/shutdown performance. As you may recall,
our times grew roughly exponentially before - as the attached graph
shows, they now grow roughly linearly. The data also shows that the
MPI_INIT penalty is fairly small. This is due to the data exchange being
&quot;encapsulated&quot; in the initial data sent back at the stage_1
trigger, thus avoiding any further overhead as the number of processes
grows. The data was taken using the rsh launcher.<br><br>
We should be able to further improve our scalability once we (a)
incorporate a tree-based scheme into the rsh launcher and (b) utilize a
tree-based (or better) broadcast mechanism for sending the trigger
messages (right now, we send them linearly across the
processes).<br><br>
Anyway, thought you might find this of interest.<br>
