Hi Jeff,<br>
<br>
Here is the unified diff.<br>
As only the romio subtree is modified, I made the following command:<br>
&nbsp; diff -u -r -x .svn ompi-trunk/ompi/mca/io/romio/romio/
NEW-ROMIO-FOR-OPENMPI/ompi/mca/io/romio/romio/ &gt; DIFF_UPDATE<br>
&nbsp; tar cvzf DIFF_UPDATE.TGZ DIFF_UPDATE<br>
<br>
Compilation is OK. I run the ROMIO tests.<br>
<br>
There are a few new modifications that are not in bitbucket. I think it
is not necessary to update bitbucket
(<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://bitbucket.org/devezep/new-romio-for-openmpi/">http://bitbucket.org/devezep/new-romio-for-openmpi/</a> ).<br>

  <pre wrap="">Thanks Pascal!

Is there any change you could send a unified diff of the tip of your hg vs. the SVN trunk HEAD?

E.g., if you have an hg+ssh combo tree, could you "hg up" in there to get all your work, and then "svn diff &gt; diff.out" and then compress and send the diff.out?

Thanks!

I am in charge of ticket 1888 (see at <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/ticket/1888">https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/ticket/1888</a>).
I have made the porting of ROMIO available in bitbucket since September 17th 2010. (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://bitbucket.org/devezep/new-romio-for-openmpi/">http://bitbucket.org/devezep/new-romio-for-openmpi/</a> )
Until now, I do not have any report on this porting and it's now time to bring it into the trunk.
All modified files are located under the romio subtree.
