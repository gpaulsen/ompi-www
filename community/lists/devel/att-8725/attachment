The last changes are not committed back in bitbucket. I thought that
was not necessary. Would you like that I update also bitbucket ? If
yes, I will do it.<br>
<br>
Applying the diff on a local copy of the trunk, you should be able to
generated a library with the new ROMIO.<br>

Are those final changes committed back to the bitbucket?  If so, I'll give it a whirl.

    <pre wrap="">Hi Jeff,

Here is the unified diff.
As only the romio subtree is modified, I made the following command:
  diff -u -r -x .svn ompi-trunk/ompi/mca/io/romio/romio/ NEW-ROMIO-FOR-OPENMPI/ompi/mca/io/romio/romio/ &gt; DIFF_UPDATE
  tar cvzf DIFF_UPDATE.TGZ DIFF_UPDATE

Compilation is OK. I run the ROMIO tests.

There are a few new modifications that are not in bitbucket. I think it is not necessary to update bitbucket (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://bitbucket.org/devezep/new-romio-for-openmpi/">http://bitbucket.org/devezep/new-romio-for-openmpi/</a> ).

Is there any change you could send a unified diff of the tip of your hg vs. the SVN trunk HEAD?

E.g., if you have an hg+ssh combo tree, could you "hg up" in there to get all your work, and then "svn diff &gt; diff.out" and then compress and send the diff.out?

Thanks!

I am in charge of ticket 1888 (see at 
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/ticket/1888">https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/ticket/1888</a>
).
I have made the porting of ROMIO available in bitbucket since September 17th 2010. (
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://bitbucket.org/devezep/new-romio-for-openmpi/">http://bitbucket.org/devezep/new-romio-for-openmpi/</a>
 )
Until now, I do not have any report on this porting and it's now time to bring it into the trunk.
All modified files are located under the romio subtree.
