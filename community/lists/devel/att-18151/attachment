It's time to schedule our next face-to-face meeting.&nbsp; IBM has graciously offered the use of their facilities in Dallas, TX.&nbsp; Apparently hotels and the IBM facilities are within a tax ride of the Dallas airport (i.e., much closer than the Cisco facilities).<br>
<br>
Right now, the facilities are fairly open through Jan and Feb, but they book up fast.&nbsp; So please answer this Doodle by the weekly webex next Tuesday (13 Oct 2015) so that we can pick a week:<br>

I (pseudo-)arbitrarily picked Tue-Thu meeting days, assuming that people would fly in on Monday, and we could start first thing on Tuesday morning.&nbsp; And then finish up by early afternoon Thursday so people could possibly fly out Thursday afternoon (or Friday,
 if that's not possible).<br>
