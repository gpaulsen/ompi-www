All:<br><br>We are now at the point where Ralph is ready to merge the
changes he has been making to ORTE into the trunk.&nbsp; This is a major
item for the 1.3 release and its inclusion into the trunk will enable
it to be tested and stabilized on a wider variety of environments.&nbsp; To
make this merge as smooth as possible, I propose the following
procedure and timing:<br>
<br>&nbsp; Between now and the morning (EST) of the 28th (Thursday):&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - hold off on major changes to the trunk, particularly those that would change the existing directory structure.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- the trunk will not be locked, nor under gatekeeper control, so
modifications can still be committed.&nbsp; But, please use judgement as to
what gets checked in between now and Thursday.<br>
<br>&nbsp; Morning (EST) of the 28th (Thursday):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Ralph will send
out a note to the devel list to let people know when he is starting his
merge.&nbsp; At this point, the trunk will become unstable until his merge
is finished and initial tests are run.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - During this time, please hold off on any modifications to the trunk.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Ralph will send out a subsequent note when his merge is done, and the
trunk is once again available.&nbsp; Hopefully this will be within 48 hours
of the start of the merge.<br>
<br>I hope that this sequence will be acceptable to the development
community.&nbsp; If not, please surface the concerns here so that we can
discuss them and decide how best to proceed.<br><br>Thanks,
