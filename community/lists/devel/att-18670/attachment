<div dir="ltr"><div><div><div><div><div>Hello all<br><br></div>Here is a 101 level question:<br><br></div>OpenMPI supports many transports, out of the box, and can be extended to support those which it does not. Some of these transports, such as infiniband, provide hardware atomic operations on remote memory, whereas others, such as iWARP, do not.<br><br></div>My question is: how (and where in the code base) does openMPI use this feature, on those hardware that support it? What is the penalty, in terms of additional code, runtime performance and all other considerations, on a hardware that does not support it?<br><br></div>Thanks in advance.<br></div>Durga<br><div><div><div><div><div><div><br clear="all"><div><div class="gmail_signature">Life is complex.
