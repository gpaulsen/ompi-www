We have talked about this on the weekly calls, but for those of you who have not been able to attend, here's a summary of our expected plans with git branches, github repos, etc.:
<div class=""><br class="">
</div>
<div class="">1. v2.0.0 has been released. &nbsp;Yay!</div>
<div class=""><br class="">
</div>
<div class="">2. A picture is worth 1,000 words: below is the git branching plan for the v2.x series going forward (more discussion below):</div>
<div class=""><br class="">
</div>
<div class=""><img apple-inline="yes" id="25C0D54C-B56D-4E0A-8CC5-CDD2AB753C6E" height="260" width="640" apple-width="yes" apple-height="yes" src="cid:A46BCBDC-157A-49DB-B3F0-D772072AED93@cdnivt.cisco.com" class=""></div>
<div class=""><br class="">
</div>
<div class="">3. Today will be the end of the mandatory 2-day hold on merging anything into the v2.x branch. &nbsp;We have this 2-day hold for the &quot;oh crud!&quot; factor after a large release -- i.e., in case anything major is discovered right after the release, we can
 do a small commit to fix the problem, and then re-release (without anything else new). &nbsp;This means that tomorrow, Howard and I will start merging some of the existing v2.0.1 PRs. &nbsp;We'll likely merge in several a day and let MTT and friends chug through them.
 &nbsp;It'll probably only take a few days to chug through the v2.0.1 PRs -- most of them are small / low risk.</div>
<div class=""><br class="">
</div>
<div class="">4. As a reminder, v2.0.1 is ONLY for bug fixes. &nbsp;No new features will be accepted. &nbsp;Backwards compatibility with v2.0.0 MUST be preserved.</div>
<div class=""><br class="">
</div>
<div class="">5. Once we have finished merging most (all?) v2.0.1 PRs, we'll create a v2.0.x branch from the v2.x branch. &nbsp;The v2.0.1 release (and subsequent v2.0.x releases) will come from that branch.</div>
<div class=""><br class="">
</div>
<div class="">6. The v2.x branch will continue on and eventually become v2.1.0. &nbsp;v2.1.0 will be backwards compatible with v2.0.0.</div>
<div class=""><br class="">
</div>
<div class="">7. We may need to have pull requests to multiple release branches (e.g., to fix a bug in both v2.0.1 and v2.1.0).</div>
<div class=""><br class="">
</div>
<div class="">8. As a reminder, we have two Github repos: ompi and ompi-release. &nbsp;ompi contains the development master, and ompi-release contains all the release branches. &nbsp;We did this split because Github didn't used to support per-branch ACLs. &nbsp;Now they do,
 and now that we have released v2.0.0 we can officially start thinking about folding the ompi-release repo back into the ompi repo. &nbsp;...however, as you all know, we're in the middle of migrating all of Open MPI's hosting infrastructure away from Indiana U.,
 and that's taking quite a bit of time and effort. &nbsp;As such, the &quot;fold ompi-release back into ompi&quot; plan may get delayed a bit. &nbsp;Sorry folks -- there's only so many sysadmin-related cycles to go around, and the migration efforts have concrete deadlines. &nbsp;:-\
 &nbsp;Bear with us until we can get this done.<br class="">
