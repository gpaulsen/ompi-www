<PRE><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><I>&gt; As for tech assistance, contact Cindy at LANL (Ralph has her contact 
&gt; info -- indeed, she might proactively contact your people anyway, to 
&gt; setup for smooth sailing on the actual conference days).
Ralph, could you please give me Cindys contact information? 

Thanks,
