I&#39;m not entirely sure what you&#39;re trying to do.  It sounds like you&#39;re trying to replace one process with another.  That&#39;s quite complicated; there will be a lot of changes required in the code base to do this.<br>

<br>
- you&#39;ll need to notify the ORTE subsystem of the process change<br>
- this notification will likely need to span multiple processes<br>
- all MPI processes will need to quiesce their communications, disconnect, and reconnect<br>
- ...and probably other things<br>
<br>
That being said, you might be able to leverage some of the work that&#39;s been done with checkpoint/restart/migration.  It&#39;s not entirely the same thing that you&#39;re doing, but it&#39;s at least similar (quiesce networks, [pretend to] move a process from location A to location B, etc.).<br>

&gt; Hello to all.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I&#39;m new in the forum, at least is the first time i write.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I&#39;m working with open mpi and I would do a little experiment, i will try to pass one process by another process.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; For example, assuming that there are 2 processes that are communicating say rank 1 and 2. And there is a process of rank 3, I would like the rank 3 (it could be assumed that this node is marked down at the initial hostfile) took the place of rank 2, and rank 1 still think that he is communicating with rank 2 when in fact is communicating with the rank 3.<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; I guess I&#39;ll have to modify tables as orte_job_map_t and orte_proc_t, but I wanted to know if someone already has experience doing something similar, and can guide me at least.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The communication between processes, in principle, would be irrelevant, so i will not need to use checkpoints / restarts for now.<br>
&gt;<br>
