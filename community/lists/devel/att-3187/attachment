All:<br><br>The latest scrub of the 1.3 release schedule and contents is ready for review and comment.&nbsp; Please use the following links:<br>&nbsp; 1.3 milestones:&nbsp; <a href="https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/milestone/Open%20MPI%201.3">https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/milestone/Open%20MPI%201.3</a><br>
&nbsp; 1.3.1 milestones: <a href="https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/milestone/Open%20MPI%201.3.1">https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/milestone/Open%20MPI%201.3.1</a><br><br>In order to try and keep the dates for 1.3 in, I&#39;ve pushed a bunch of stuff (particularly ORTE things) to 1.3.1.&nbsp; Even though there will be new functionality slated for 1.3.1, the goal is to not have any interface changes between the phases.<br>
<br>Please look over the list and schedules and let me or my fellow 1.3 co-release manager George Bosilca (<span class="HcCDpe"><span class="lDACoc"><a href="mailto:bosilca@eecs.utk.edu">bosilca@eecs.utk.edu</a>) </span></span>know of any issues, errors, suggestions, omissions, heartburn, etc.<br>
<br>Thanks,<br>--Brad<br><br>Brad Benton<br>IBM<br>
