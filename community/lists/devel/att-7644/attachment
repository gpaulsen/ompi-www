<div>Hi,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In open MPI, where are the binaries stored. </div>
<div>Let&#39;s say I have a program P that adds the numbers in an array of length 10</div>
<div>I want to distribute the execution between 2 computers A and B</div>
<div>A adds from array[0] to array[4]</div>
<div>B adds from array[5] to array[9]</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I understand that I have to tell mpi that machines A and B exist and that I want the processes to be exected as required.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>No problem with this, my confusion is in the implementation.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>lets say I am running the adding program P from machine C.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>When I execute the P program, how do computers A and B know what binary to execute? My binaries are in copmuter C!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Does MPI copy the binaries to machines A and B from C? and then executes the program?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>How is the program P loaded to memory in A and B, is P stored on disk in A and B?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Do I have to copy the P binaries in A and B prior to executing the program?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>When the program P has finished execution , what happens to the binaries.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have not found anything on the web to answer my question</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thank you</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
