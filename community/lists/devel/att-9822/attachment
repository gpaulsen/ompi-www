Hi,<br>I am using OpenMPI version 1.4.3 on CentOS5.4 machines (connected back to back using Infiniband HW)<br>I am trying to run example apps in OpenMPI using the below command.<br><br>&quot;<i><b>mpirun --prefix /usr/local/ -np 2 --mca btl openib --mca btl_openib_cpc_include rdmacm -hostfile tmp_host_file ring_c</b></i>&quot;  <br>
<br>Here tmp_host_file contains IP addresses of two hosts.  After running this command, I see the error as<br><br>&quot;<i><b>At least one pair of MPI processes are unable to reach each other for<br>MPI communications.  This means that no Open MPI device has indicated<br>
that it can be used to communicate between these processes.  This is<br>
an error; Open MPI requires that all MPI processes be able to reach<br>each other.</b></i>&quot;<br>This clearly indicates that there is an option missing the command due to which MPI processes are not able to reach each other.  Can you please let me know <br>
1) how do we resolve this<br>2) IP is the only way for MPI processes to reach each other (i.e. it&#39;ll go via IPoIB in infiniband case) ?<br><br>Thanks &amp; Regards,<br>Ramu<br clear="all">
