<FONT FACE="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><SPAN STYLE='font-size:12.0px'>Does this mean that we don&#8217;t have a queue to store btl level descriptors that<BR>

<BR>
Seems to me like we want to mark things complete at the MPI level ASAP, and<BR>
&nbsp;that this proposal is not to do that &#8211; is this correct ?<BR>

&gt;&gt; Remember that this is all in the context of Galen's proposal for<BR>
&gt;&gt; btl_send() to be able to return NOT_ON_WIRE -- meaning that the send<BR>
&gt;&gt; was successful, but it has not yet been sent (e.g., openib BTL<BR>
&gt;&gt; buffered it because it ran out of credits).<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Sorry if I miss something obvious, but why does the PML has to be <BR>
&gt; aware<BR>
&gt; of the flow control situation of the BTL ? If the BTL cannot send<BR>
&gt; something right away for any reason, it should be the responsibility <BR>
&gt; of<BR>
&gt; the BTL to buffer it and to progress on it later.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
That's currently the way it is. &nbsp;But the BTL currently only has the <BR>
option to say two things:<BR>
<BR>
1. &quot;ok, done!&quot; -- then the PML will think that the request is complete<BR>
2. &quot;doh -- error!&quot; -- then the PML thinks that Something Bad <BR>
Happened(tm)<BR>
<BR>
What we really need is for the BTL to have a third option:<BR>
<BR>
3. &quot;not done yet!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
So that the PML knows that the request is not yet done, but will allow <BR>
other things to progress while we're waiting for it to complete. &nbsp;<BR>
Without this, the openib BTL currently replies &quot;ok, done!&quot;, even when <BR>
it has only buffered a message (rather than actually sending it out). &nbsp;<BR>
This optimization works great (yeah, I know...) except for apps that <BR>
don't dip into the MPI library frequently. &nbsp;:-\<BR>
