The intent of this change is to allow ORTE to execute the launch cmd and modex operations over the fabric, thus reducing startup time. These operations occur during times when MPI communication cannot be taking place, and thus no impact is made on application performance. IO forwarding, however, will continue to flow over the Ethernet transport to avoid impacting MPI operations.</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">I’ll be updating the PR over the next week as we complete the transition. This will include modifying the RML framework APIs to allow callers to direct messages to their preferred transport. We will then update all existing RML calls to the revised APIs.</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">Any comments and/or questions should be noted on the PR, but I wanted to ensure everyone was aware of it.</div><div class="">Ralph</div><div class=""><br class=""></div></body></html>
