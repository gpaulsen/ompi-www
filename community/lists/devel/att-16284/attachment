Jenkins runs automated tests on each pull request, and i think this is a<br>
good thing.<br>
<br>
recently, it reported a bunch of failure but i could not find anything<br>
to blame in the PR itself.<br>
<br>
so i created a dummy PR <a href="https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/pull/264" target="_blank">https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/pull/264</a> with<br>
git commit --allow-empty<br>
and waited for Jenkins to do its job.<br>
<br>
the test failed, which means there is an issue in the master.<br>
from the master point of view, it is good to know there is an issue.<br>
from the PR point of view, this is a false positive since the PR does<br>
nothing wrong.<br>
<br>
i was unable to find anything on github that indicates the master does<br>
not pass the automated tests.<br>
is such automated test running vs the master ? if yes, where can we find<br>
the results ?<br>
in order to avoid dealing with false positive, is there any possibility<br>
to disable automated tests on the PR<br>
if the master does not pass the tests ?<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
<br>
Gilles<br>
