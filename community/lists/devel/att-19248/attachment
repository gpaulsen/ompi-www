Mellanox Jenkins marks recent PR&#39;s as failed for very surprising reasons.<br>
<br>
<br>
mpirun --mca btl sm,self ...<br>
<br>
<br>
failed because processes could not contact each other. i was able to reproduce this once on my workstation,<br>
<br>
and found the root cause was a dirty build and/or install dir.<br>
<br>
<br>
i added some debug in autogen.sh and found that :<br>
<br>
- the workspace (install dir) contains some old files<br>
<br>
- it seems all PR&#39;s use the same workspace (if it was clean, that would be ok as long as Jenkins process only one PR at a time)<br>
<br>
- there are currently two PR&#39;s being processed for the ompi-release repo, and per the log, they seem to use run from the very same directory<br>
<br>
- Jenkins for the pmix repo seems to suffer the same issue<br>
<br>
<br>
could someone have a look at this ?<br>
<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
<br>
<br>
Gilles<br>
