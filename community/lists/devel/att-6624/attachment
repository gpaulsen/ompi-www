Hi folks<br><br>We have been getting MTT errors that prevent build on systems that support the MTL PSM module. I took a look this morning and fixed a couple of them. However, there are two more that I cannot fix since I don&#39;t have access to such a system:<br>
<br style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><pre style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">mtl_psm.c:132: error: struct psm_ep_open_opts has no member named ib_port<br>mtl_psm.c:133: error: struct psm_ep_open_opts has no member named ib_service_level<br>
<br><br>Could someone familiar with that module please fix this?<br><br>Thanks<br>Ralph<br><br></pre>
