In reference to this critical bug, there are implications for the current 1.3.x release schedule that are alluded to in Jeff&#39;s message.  In particular, there are two time-critical issues at play:<br>  1) getting a fix for #1853 in time for inclusion for OFED-1.4.1<div>
  2) getting in Sun&#39;s changes/CMRs in time for their next test/release cycle</div><div><br></div><div>Given those two time-constrained goals, we have decided to proceed as follows:</div><div>  - Sun&#39;s desired changes are either already in the 1.3 branch, or the CMRs have already been approved for inclusion</div>
<div>  - hold off non-Sun related CMRs until a fix for #1853 is available, hopefully sometime next week</div><div>  - release this combination as 1.3.2</div><div>  - the windows functionality will then follow as a separate release: 1.3.3</div>
<div><br></div><div>I know that this, once again, pushes out the windows functionality, but I think that this is necessary in order to get this critical fix in.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks,</div><div>--Brad</div><div>

<br><br>The Open MPI team has uncovered a serious bug in Open MPI v1.3.0 and v1.3.1: when running on OpenFabrics-based networks, silent data corruption is possible in some cases.  There are two workarounds to avoid the issue -- please see the bug ticket that has been opened about this issue for further details:<br>

<br>
We strongly encourage all users who are using Open MPI v1.3.0 and/or v1.3.1 on OpenFabrics-based networks to read this ticket and use one of the workarounds described there.<br>
<br>
The Open MPI team is working on a fix; it will be included in the v1.3.2 release.  Updates will be posted to the ticket.<br><font color="#888888">
