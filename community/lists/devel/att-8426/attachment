Per a discussion on the devel telecon a week or two ago, I have refactored the opal/util/if.c code into a static framework (ala the installdirs implementation) so that the various cases are dealt with in configure.m4 instead of a mass of interwoven #if-#else clauses. Jeff will undoubtedly do some cleanup of the configury magic, but the basic functionality is ready for initial review.<div>
<br></div><div>For those who care, please clone and check the code at <a href="http://bitbucket.org/rhc/ompi-if">http://bitbucket.org/rhc/ompi-if</a> to ensure that the correct opal/mca/if components are being built for your environment, and that the discovered interfaces are correct. Please let me know (up or down) so we can get a feel for how close we are to bringing this back to the trunk.</div>
