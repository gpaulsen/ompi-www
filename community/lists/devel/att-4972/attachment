<FONT FACE="Calibri, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><SPAN STYLE='font-size:11pt'>Now that 1.3 will be released, we would like to go ahead with the plan to move the btl&#8217;s out of the MPI layer. &nbsp;Greg Koenig who is doing most of the work has started a wiki page with details on the plans. &nbsp;Right now details are sketchy, as Greg &nbsp;is digging through the code, and has only hand written notes on data structures that need to be moved, include files that are not needed, etc. &nbsp;The page is at:<BR>

The first three steps basically only involve code motion, moving items such as ompi_list, and renaming them, moving where the code is actually located in the repository, and the like. &nbsp;For these we do not plan to put out a formal RFC, but comments are very welcome, and any hands that are willing to help with this are even more welcome.<BR>
<BR>
The last phase where the btl&#8217;s are made dependent on OPAL, and supporting libraries such as mpools I expect will be disruptive, and will definitely require an RFC, and will also be a longer process.<BR>

Please send comments,<BR>
