I'd suggest supporting CUDA device queries in carto and hwloc.<BR>

My $0.02: cuda shouldn't be disabled by default (and only enabled if you --with-cuda).  If configure finds all the Right cuda magic, then cuda support should be enabled by default.  Just like all other optional support libraries that OMPI uses.

More specifically: the cuda support code in OMPI should strive to be such that it can be enabled by default and not cause any performance penalties to codes that do not need/use any cuda stuff.  I'm not saying I know how to do that -- I'm just saying that that should be the goal.  :-)
