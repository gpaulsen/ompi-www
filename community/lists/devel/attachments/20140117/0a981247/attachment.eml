Problem description:

I am trying to track down the warnings that occur when compiling the =20
UCAR NetCDF package with PGI compilers.  I have found a case that gcc =20=

does not warn about, but pgcc does.  If I understand the code and the =20=

C (1990) standard, I think pgcc is complaining too much.

You can reproduce the warnings by downloading the UCAR NetCDF source =20
package, netcdf.tar.gz, from =
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/=20
.  Assuming you download it to /usr/local/src, here are the commands =20
that illustrate the warnings:

# cd /usr/local/src
# tar -xzf netcdf.tar.gz
# cd netcdf-4.1.1
# ./configure &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
# cd ncgen
# pgcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I.. -I../fortran       -I.. -I../libsrc -=20
I../libsrc    -g -O2 -tp amd64 -Msignextend -DNO_PGI_OFFSET -c -o =20
genf77.o genf77.c
PGC-W-0095-Type cast required for this conversion (genf77.c: 498)
PGC-W-0095-Type cast required for this conversion (genf77.c: 511)
PGC/x86-64 Linux 10.3-0: compilation completed with warnings

To eliminate the warnings, I had to modify the two source lines to =20
cast the result from static const char* f77varncid() as (char *):

&gt;     /* Use the specialized put_att_XX routines if possible*/
&gt;     switch (basetype-&gt;typ.typecode) {
&gt;     case NC_BYTE:
&gt;     case NC_SHORT:
&gt;     case NC_INT:
&gt;     case NC_FLOAT:
&gt;     case NC_DOUBLE:
&gt;         f77attrify(asym,code);
&gt;         codedump(code);
&gt;         bbClear(code);
&gt;         bbprintf0(stmt,&quot;stat =3D nf_put_att_%s(ncid, %s, %s, %s, %lu, =20=

&gt; %sval)\n&quot;,
&gt;                 nfstype(basetype-&gt;typ.typecode),
&gt;                 (asym-&gt;att.var =3D=3D NULL?&quot;NF_GLOBAL&quot;
&gt;                                       :(char *) f77varncid(asym-=20
&gt; &gt;att.var)),   &lt;--- here
&gt;                 f77escapifyname(asym-&gt;name),
&gt;                 nftype(basetype-&gt;typ.typecode),
&gt;                 len,
&gt;                 ncftype(basetype-&gt;typ.typecode));
&gt;         codedump(stmt);
&gt;         break;
&gt;
&gt;     case NC_CHAR:
&gt;         len =3D bbLength(code);
&gt;         f77quotestring(code);
&gt;         bbprintf0(stmt,&quot;stat =3D nf_put_att_text(ncid, %s, %s, %lu, &quot;,
&gt;                 (asym-&gt;att.var =3D=3D NULL?&quot;NF_GLOBAL&quot;
&gt;                                       :(char *)f77varncid(asym-=20
&gt; &gt;att.var)),   &lt;--- and here
&gt;                 f77escapifyname(asym-&gt;name),
&gt;                 (len=3D=3D0?1:len));
&gt;         codedump(stmt);
&gt;         codedump(code);
&gt;         codeline(&quot;)&quot;);
&gt;         break;

Here is static const char* f77varncid():

&gt; /* Compute the name for a given var's id*/
&gt; /* Watch out: the result is a static*/
&gt; static const char*
&gt; f77varncid(Symbol* vsym)
&gt; {
&gt;     const char* tmp1;
&gt;     char* vartmp;
&gt;     tmp1 =3D f77name(vsym);
&gt;     vartmp =3D poolalloc(strlen(tmp1)+strlen(&quot;_id&quot;)+1);
&gt;     strcpy(vartmp,tmp1);
&gt;     strcat(vartmp,&quot;_id&quot;);
&gt;     return vartmp;
&gt; }

There are other lines in genf77.c that use f77varncid() in a print =20
statement, so the warnings do not occur every time f77varncid() =20
provides a string for %s:

&gt;     if (nvars &gt; 0) {
&gt;         f77skip();
&gt;         f77comment(&quot;variable ids&quot;);
&gt;         for(ivar =3D 0; ivar &lt; nvars; ivar++) {
&gt;             Symbol* vsym =3D (Symbol*)listget(vardefs,ivar);
&gt;             bbprintf0(stmt,&quot;integer %s;\n&quot;, f77varncid(vsym));
&gt;             codedump(stmt);
&gt;         }

The warnings occur in the only two instances where f77varncid() is =20
used in a conditional expression.  In both cases, the second operand =20
is a literal string, e.g., &quot;NF_GLOBAL&quot;.  I would have thought that a =20
(static const char*) and a string literal would be compatible types.  =20=

I experimented with a (const char *) cast instead of a (char *) cast, =20=

but that does not work.  I think it should.

I admit, I have an old copy of the C standard =97 from 1990.  But, =20
here's my interpretation of what it says about this:

=95 6.1.4 String literals, says string literals are converted to an =20
array of type char.  If the program attempts to modify a string =20
literal, the behavior is undefined.  It does not say that the type has =20=

the const type qualifier (though, you would think it should).

=95 6.3.15 Conditional operator, says if the second and third operands =20=

are pointers ..., the result type is a pointer to a type qualified =20
with all the type qualifiers of the types pointed-to by both operands.

This would seem to explain the warning message, since the string =20
literal is (char *) and f77varncid() is (const char *).  However, =20
6.3.15 goes on to say:

Furthermore, if both operands are pointers to ... differently =20
qualified versions of a compatible type, the result has the composite =20=

type.

Which leads me to believe you are allowed to mix const and non-const =20
versions of a compatible type.

Lastly:

=95 6.5.3 Type qualifiers, says that the properties associated with =20
qualified types are meaningful only for expressions that are lvalues.

Seems to make the issue moot, since it says const-ness only applies to =20=

lvalues.

So, I think both 6.3.15 and 6.5.3 imply that (char *) and (const char =20=

*) are compatible as the second and third operands in a conditional =20
expression which is not an lvalue, which is the case in this code.  As =20=

I mentioned above, gcc does not complain about this code.  What do you =20=

think?
