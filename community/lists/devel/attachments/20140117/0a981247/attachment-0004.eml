&gt; The more I thought about this issue, it seems to me the C 1990 section=20
&gt; 6.3.15 applies:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; =95 6.3.15 Conditional operator, says if the second and third operands =

&gt;&gt;&gt; with all the type qualifiers of the types pointed-to by both operands.
&gt;
&gt; Thus, ( cond ? (char *) : (const char *) ) should have the result type=20
&gt; (const char *).  Both (char *) and (const char *) are compatible as=20
&gt; rvalues with (const char *), similar to passing either a (char *) or a=20
&gt; (const char *) to a (const char *) function argument.  pgcc should not=20

Larry,

  I created TPR 17139, and put your arguments in the report.
Engineering has not responded yet, but there is every possibility
you are correct.

  The language standards are are complicated, so I let
engineering tell me if a problem like this is a user bug or a compiler=20
defect.

regards,
dave
