Thanks for the patch.  A few comments:

The vendor_id and vendor_part_id actually the *remote* values of this =20=

information.  Shouldn't that go in endpoint.rem_info?

Is there a reason to put the max_inline_data on the endpoint rather =20
than accessing it through endpoint-&gt;endpoint_btl-&gt;device-&gt;ib_dev?  =20
(I'm a little confused on how it is used / assigned -- I could be =20
missing something here)

What testing has been done to see that this stuff works?

Has an equivalent patch been made for Pasha's ofacm work?

&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; Some time ago Mellanox proposed design that should improve current =20
&gt; support for heterogeneous clusters (see Design.txt).The design was =20
&gt; accepted by IB vendors, and now we propose patch that adds a =20
&gt; heterogeneous cluster support. The path leaves one issue that we do =20=

&gt; not resolve completely. If 2 different procs have different QPs =20
&gt; configuration (P/S/X) we print nice warning message that describes =20
&gt; that such configuration is not supported and it propose way to =20
&gt; resolve the issue.  Theoretically it will be best to provide =20
&gt; solution that automatically will resolve the problem, but it will =20
&gt; require significant changes on openib blt that we don=92t want to =20
&gt; introduce in this stage.
&gt;
&gt; Please comment.
