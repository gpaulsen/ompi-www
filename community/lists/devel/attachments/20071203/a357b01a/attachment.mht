At today's OMPI concall meeting it was decided some bug management was 
appropriate.  In order to do this we would like the community to do the 
following two tasks:

1.  Review all 1.2.X bugs under trac send email to the devel alias as to 
the bugs you think should be fixed for 1.2.5 and beyond.  Any of the 
bugs not included on these list will be considered as items that can be 
either dropped or pushed to 1.3 and beyond.

2.  Update all bugs under the 1.3 and Future milestones with pertinent 
information.

We would like these tasks done before the Dec 4th concall so we can 
discuss where we are at with our current set of bugs.

thanks,

Terry and Rich
