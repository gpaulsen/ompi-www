    Hello,<br>
    <br>
    Referring to the following bug<br>
    <br>
    <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/ticket/2681">https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/ticket/2681</a><br>
    <br>
    that MPI_Publish_name was hanging, in fact, any call that contacted
    the ompi-server was hanging. By looking at all communication between
    the application and ompi-server, it seemed that the ompi-server was
    getting the wrong/bad route to reach the application in order to
    send back the answer of publish/lookup/unpublish. <br>
    <br>
    In orte/mca/routed/binomial/routed_binomial.c, I found the following
    loc in the get_route() function,<br>
    <br>
    <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if
      (ORTE_PROC_IS_TOOL) {<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ret = target;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; goto found;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</font><br>
    <br>
    which, I believe, returned the target directly as the route to any
    tool. Comparing with 1.4.3, I could not understand the change that
    brought in the above case. So I simply commented it out and
    ompi-server worked perfect with all the calls doing their job.<br>
    What I do not know if this affects any other tool. <br>
    Hope this is useful.<br>
    <br>
    Best,<br>
