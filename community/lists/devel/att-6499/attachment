Hi,
<br>
</p><p>I have added the two following options: --enable-mpi-threads 
<br>
--enable-progress-threads in configure step of openmpi-1.3.3.
<br>
</p><p>After install, mpirun command doesn&#39;t work on a very simple mpi program.
<br>
There is a dead lock and program is not executed.
<br>
</p>Bernard
