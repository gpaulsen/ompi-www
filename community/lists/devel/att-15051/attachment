<div dir="ltr">Hi Gilles<div><br></div><div>Had a chance to review this with folks here, and we think that having oversubscribe automatically set overload makes some sense. However, we do want to retain the ability to separately specify oversubscribe and overload as well since these two terms don&#39;t mean quite the same thing.</div>
<div><br></div><div>Our proposal, therefore, is to have the --oversubscribe flag set both the --map-by :oversubscribe and --bind-to :overload-allowed properties. If someone specifies both the --oversubscribe flag and a conflicting directive for one or both of the individual properties, then we&#39;ll error out with a &quot;bozo&quot; message.</div>
<div><br></div><div>The use-cases you describe are (minus the crash) correct as the warning only is emitted when you are overloaded (i.e., trying to bind to more cpus than you have). So you won&#39;t get any warning when running on three nodes as you have enough cpus for all the procs, etc.</div>
<div><br></div><div>I&#39;ll investigate the crash once I get home and have access to a cluster again. The problem likely has to do with not properly responding to the failure to spawn.</div></div><div class="gmail_extra">

<br>
this issue is related to the failures reported by mtt on the trunk when<br>
the ibm test suite invokes MPI_Comm_spawn.<br>
<br>
my test bed is made of 3 (virtual) machines with 2 sockets and 8 cpus<br>
per socket each.<br>
<br>
if i run on one host (without any batch manager)<br>
<br>
mpirun -np 16 --host slurm1 --oversubscribe --mca coll ^ml<br>
./intercomm_create<br>
<br>
then the test is a success with the following warning  :<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
A request was made to bind to that would result in binding more<br>
processes than cpus on a resource:<br>
<br>
   Bind to:     CORE<br>
   Node:        slurm2<br>
   #processes:  2<br>
   #cpus:       1<br>
<br>
You can override this protection by adding the &quot;overload-allowed&quot;<br>
option to your binding directive.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
now if i run on three hosts<br>
<br>
mpirun -np 16 --host slurm1,slurm2,slurm3 --oversubscribe --mca coll ^ml<br>
./intercomm_create<br>
<br>
then the test is a success without any warning<br>
<br>
<br>
but now, if i run on two hosts<br>
<br>
mpirun -np 16 --host slurm1,slurm2 --oversubscribe --mca coll ^ml<br>
./intercomm_create<br>
<br>
then the test is a failure.<br>
<br>
first, i get the following same warning :<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
A request was made to bind to that would result in binding more<br>
processes than cpus on a resource:<br>
<br>
   Bind to:     CORE<br>
   Node:        slurm2<br>
   #processes:  2<br>
   #cpus:       1<br>
<br>
You can override this protection by adding the &quot;overload-allowed&quot;<br>
option to your binding directive.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
followed by a crash<br>
<br>
[slurm1:2482] *** An error occurred in MPI_Comm_spawn<br>
[slurm1:2482] *** reported by process [2068512769,0]<br>
[slurm1:2482] *** on communicator MPI_COMM_WORLD<br>
[slurm1:2482] *** MPI_ERR_SPAWN: could not spawn processes<br>
[slurm1:2482] *** MPI_ERRORS_ARE_FATAL (processes in this communicator<br>
will now abort,<br>
[slurm1:2482] ***    and potentially your MPI job)<br>
<br>
<br>
that being said, i the following command works :<br>
<br>
mpirun -np 16 --host slurm1,slurm2 --mca coll ^ml --bind-to none<br>
./intercomm_create<br>
<br>
<br>
1) what does the first message means ?<br>
    is it a warning ? /* if yes, why does mpirun on two hosts fail ? */<br>
    is it a fatal error ? /* if yes, why does mpirun on one host success<br>
? */<br>
<br>
2) generally speaking, and assuming the first message is a warning,<br>
should --oversubscribe automatically set overload-allowed ?<br>
    /* as far as i am concerned, that would be much more intuitive */<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
