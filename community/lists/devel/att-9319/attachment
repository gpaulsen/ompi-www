Quick question: could you please clarify this statement:<div><br></div><div><div class="gmail_quote"><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;"><div><div><div>...because more than one ORTED could (and often will) detect the failure.</div>
</div></div></blockquote><div><br></div><div>I don&#39;t understand how this can be true, except for detecting an ORTED failure. Only one orted can detect an MPI process failure, unless you have now involved orted&#39;s in MPI communications (and I don&#39;t believe you did). If the HNP directs another orted to restart that proc, and then that incarnation fails, then the epoch number -should- increment again, shouldn&#39;t it?</div>
<div><br></div><div>So are you concerned (re having the HNP mark a proc down multiple times) about orted failure detection? In that case, I agree that you can have multiple failure detections - we dealt with it differently in orcm, but I have no issue with doing it another way. Just helps to know what problem you are trying to solve.</div>
