<div dir="ltr">Hi everyone!<div><br></div><div>My team and I are working on the possibility to checkpoint a process and restarting it on another node. We are using CRIU framework for the checkpoint/restart part, but we are facing some issues related to migration.</div><div><br></div><div>First of all: we found out that some attempts to C/R an OMPI process have been already made in the past. Is anything related to that still supported/available/working?</div><div><br></div><div>Then, we need to know which network communications are used at any time, in order to &quot;pause&quot; them during migrations (at least the ones involving the migrating node). Our code analysis makes us think that:</div><div>-OpenMPI runtime (HNP&lt;-&gt;orteds) uses orte/OOB</div><div>-Running applications exchange data via ompi/BTL</div><div><br></div><div>Is that correct? If not, can someone give us a hint?</div><div><br></div><div>Questions on how to update topology info may be yet to come.</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you guys!</div><div><br></div><div>Gianmario</div></div>
