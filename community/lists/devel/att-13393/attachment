<div dir="ltr"><div>Did the mca_base_component_distill_checkpoint_ready paramter go away? Its intention was to allow a user to have a build with C/R compiled in and then choose at runtime if they want to restrict their component section to just C/R enabled components or not.

</div><div>I think if you fix the distill_checkpoint issue, then this patch is ok with me.</div><div><br></div><div>As per my other messages, I agree with the comments from Jeff and Paul about existing code. I think a good compromise at this time would be to #ifdef out the code (so it is preserved for later re-design) and leave a big comment that we need to return there in the next stage. Leave the replacement code in a comment below it.</div>

&gt; &gt; Jeff - you are jumping way ahead. I already said this needs further work to resolve blocking. These patches (per Adrian&#39;s email) just makes things compile<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Fair enough.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; But in some ways, having uncompilable code is a *good* thing, because it tells you exactly where you need to work on the architecture.  Just updating it to *compile* removes that safeguard -- will you remember/re-find all those places where it *used* to block and convert the architecture to workaround the blocking?<br>


&gt;<br>
&gt; I guess I&#39;m saying: what exactly does updating it to compile get for us, if we know the code still won&#39;t work?  It seems like all we&#39;ll be doing is removing the grep-able places where we *know* we&#39;ll have to do work in the future.<br>


<br>
</div>My goal was to let people see what I am doing and especially to decrease<br>
the number of patches I have to carry locally. I am not familiar enough with<br>
the Open MPI code (yet) to fix it correctly in the first try. Without<br>
having a code which compiles I personally cannot continue fixing the<br>
functionality. These patches are the first step which I wanted to make<br>
public. I can update the patches to include &#39;FIXME&#39; in all the place if<br>
required.<br>
