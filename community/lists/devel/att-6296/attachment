<div><br></div><div>I would still allow more procs than shown in the rankfile (mapping the rest bynode on the nodes specified in the rankfile - can&#39;t do byslot because I don&#39;t know how many slots are on each node), which means the only change in behavior would be the forced bynode mapping of unspecified procs.</div>
<div><br></div><div>So use of this option will entail some risks and a slight difference in behavior, but would relieve you from the burden of having to provide a hostfile. I&#39;m not personally convinced it is worth the risk and probable user complaints of &quot;it didn&#39;t work&quot;, but since we don&#39;t use this option, I don&#39;t have a strong opinion on the matter.</div>
<div><br></div><div>Let&#39;s just avoid going back-and-forth over wanting it, or how it should be implemented - let&#39;s get it all ironed out, and then implement it once, like we finally did at the end with the whole hostfile thing.</div>

<div>1. rankfile mapper uses already allocated machines ( by scheduler or hostfile ), by using rankfile as a hostfile we can run into problem where trying to use unallocated nodes, what can hang the run.</div> <div>2. we can&#39;t define in rankfile number of slots on each machine, which means oversubscribing can take place without any warning.</div>
<div>3. I personally dont see any problem using hostfile, even if it has redundant info, hostfile and rankfile belong to different layers in the system and solve different problems. The original hostfile ( if I recall correctly ) could bind rank to the node, but the syntax wasn&#39;t very flexible and clear.</div>

I can look at how to eat the rankfile as a hostfile. This may not even be possible - the problem is that the entire system is predicated on certain ordering due to our framework architecture. So we get an allocation, and then do a mapping against that allocation, filtering the allocation through hostfiles, -host, and other options.</div>
 <div><br></div><div>By the time we reach the rankfile mapper, we have already determined that we don&#39;t have an allocation and have to abort. It is the rankfile mapper itself that looks for the -rankfile option, so the system can have no knowledge that someone has specified that option before that point - and thus, even if I could parse the rankfile, I don&#39;t know it was given!</div>
 <div><br></div><div>What will take time is to figure out a way to either:</div><div><br></div><div>(a) allow us to run the mapper even though we don&#39;t have any nodes we know about, and allow the mapper to insert the nodes itself - without causing non-rankfile uses to break (which could be a major feat); or</div>
 <div><br></div><div>(b) have the overall system check for the rankfile option and pass it as a hostfile as well, assuming that a hostfile wasn&#39;t also given, no RM-based allocation exists, etc. - which breaks our abstraction rules and also opens a possible can of worms.</div>
 <div><br></div><div>Either way, I also then have to teach the hostfile parser how to realize it is a rankfile format and convert the info in it into what we expected to receive from a hostfile - another non-trivial problem.</div>
 <div><br></div><div>I&#39;m willing to give it a try - just trying to make clear why my response was negative. It isn&#39;t as simple as it sounds...which is why Len and I didn&#39;t pursue it when this was originally developed.</div>

 <br> That being said I think there are one of two things that could be done to mitigate the issue.<br> <br> 1.  To eliminate the element of surprise by changing mpirun to eat rankfile without the hostfile.<br> 2.  To change the error message to something understandable by the user such that they<br>
 know they might be missing the hostfile option.<br> <br> Again I understand this topic is frustrating and there are some boundaries with the design that make these two option orthogonal to each other but I really believe we need to make the rankfile option something that is easily usable by our users.<br>
