I don't know if it would make sense to send someone (or even if someone is already supposed to go) but they are planning for the next open mpi developer meeting and since we have so much going on with open mpi, I thought it would make sense to forward this email.
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>

<p><p>Developers --
<br>
<p>It's time to schedule our next face-to-face meeting.  IBM has graciously offered the use of their facilities in Dallas, TX.  Apparently hotels and the IBM facilities are within a tax ride of the Dallas airport (i.e., much closer than the Cisco facilities).
<br>
<p>Right now, the facilities are fairly open through Jan and Feb, but they book up fast.  So please answer this Doodle by the weekly webex next Tuesday (13 Oct 2015) so that we can pick a week:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://doodle.com/poll/fzr9vebqpsh37ii6">http://doodle.com/poll/fzr9vebqpsh37ii6</a>
<br>
<p>I (pseudo-)arbitrarily picked Tue-Thu meeting days, assuming that people would fly in on Monday, and we could start first thing on Tuesday morning.  And then finish up by early afternoon Thursday so people could possibly fly out Thursday afternoon (or Friday, if that's not possible).
