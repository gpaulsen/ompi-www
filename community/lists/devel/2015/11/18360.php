I think this is driven by the fact that odin has some very old compilers and a very different environment, and so it has historically generated more warnings.

Sure, but the automation could be set up to do builds on both Odin and newer systems.  I think it's easier to tend to this sort of warning cruft as it happens, rather than big stomps later on, but that's just personal preference.  It would also hopefully reduce the amount of cherry picking that needs to happen to release branches.
