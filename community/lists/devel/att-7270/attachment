<br>You asked for dynamic rules but it looks like you didn&#39;t provide them. Dynamic rules allow the user to specify which algorithm to be used for each collective based on a set of rules. I corrected the current behavior, so it will not crash. However, as you didn&#39;t provide dynamic rules, it will just switch back to default behavior (i.e. ignore the coll_tuned_use_dynamic_rules MCA parameter).<br>
<br>As an example, here is a set of dynamic rules. I added some comment to clarify it, but if you have any questions please ask.<br><br>2 # num of collectives<br>3 # ID = 3 Alltoall collective (ID in coll_tuned.h)<br>1 # number of com sizes<br>
64 # comm size 64<br>2 # number of msg sizes<br>0 3 0 0 # for message size 0, bruck 1, topo 0, 0 segmentation<br>8192 2 0 0 # 8k+, pairwise 2, no topo or segmentation<br># end of collective rule<br>#<br>2  # ID = 2 Allreduce collective (ID in coll_tuned.h)<br>
1  # number of com sizes<br>1  # comm size 2<br>2  # number of msg sizes<br>0 1 0 0  # for message size 0, basic linear 1, topo 0, 0 segmentation<br>1024 2 0 0 # for messages size &gt; 1024, nonoverlapping 2, topo 0, 0 segmentation<br>
# end of collective rule<br>#<br><br>And here is what I have in my $(HOME)/.openmpi/mca-params.conf to activate them:<br>#<br># Dealing with collective<br>#<br>coll_base_verbose = 0<br><br>coll_tuned_use_dynamic_rules = 1<br>
coll_tuned_dynamic_rules_filename = **the name of the file where you saved the rules **<br><br></div><div>&quot;</div><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Wed, Dec 30, 2009 at 4:44 PM, Daniel Spångberg <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:daniels@mkem.uu.se" target="_blank">daniels@mkem.uu.se</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br>

<br>
Do you know of a work around? I have not used a rule file before and seem to be unable to find the documentation for how to use one, unfortunately.<br>

Maybe it&#39;s priority should be raised up.<br>
