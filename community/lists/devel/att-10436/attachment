    Thanks, Ralph.<br>
    <br>
    I am a little deficient in the autotools department.<br>
    So, I will probably only be able to retest after a new trunk tarball
    is generated tonight.<br>
    <br>
    In the meantime I might be able to get more info on the config.h
    problem.<br>
    If I add -save-temps to CFLAGS I should be able to examine the .i
    file w/o and w/ --disable-hwloc.<br>
    That will either prove or disprove what I've claimed is happening.<br>

          The rank_file component should not attempt to build if
          --without-hwloc is given - I've fixed that now. Thanks for
          reporting it.<br>
          <br>
          With that fix, I was able to build the trunk on Mac - testing
          Linux now. I haven't checked for the config.h confusion you
          report, though - just noting that it built.</blockquote>
