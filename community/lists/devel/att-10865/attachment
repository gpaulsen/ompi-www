which is unpleasant. &nbsp;But worse, what does it possibly accomplish? &nbsp;In<br>
codes other than benchmarks, there's no advantage to aligning the pointer<br>
to 32 or 64 byte boundaries, as the malloced buffer very rarely is exactly<br>
what is sent. &nbsp;So you've done a whole lot of work, screwed with the memory<br>
allocator (which always bites OMPI in the butt), and accomplished nothing<br>
useful. &nbsp;Mellanox should fix the hardware, not make everyone's life<br>
miserable with crappy workarounds.<br>
<br>
MEMORY_LINUX_PTMALLOC2 is the wrong define for what they want. &nbsp;They<br>
should check for __malloc_hook and only use that code if __malloc_hook is<br>
found.<br>

&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am thinking MEMORY_LINUX_PTMALLOC2 is probably the right define to<br>
&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;key off of but this is really going to look gross ifdef'ing out the<br>
&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;lines that are accessing the Linux memory module. &nbsp;One other idea I<br>
&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;have is to create a dummy __malloc_hook in the Solaris memory module<br>
&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;but might there be other OSes that could run into the same<br>
&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;problem? &nbsp; Or what happens if PTMALLOC2 is not used (does that<br>
&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;happen)?<br>

&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;r26255 is forcing the use of __malloc_hook which is implemented in<br>
&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;opal/mca/memory/linux however that is not compiled in the library<br>
&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;when built on Solaris thus causing a referenced symbol not found<br>
&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;when libmpi tries to load the openib btl.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am looking how to fix this now but if someone has a good idea<br>
&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;how to detect when __malloc_hook is used (or not) I'd be<br>
&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;interested in hearing it.<br>
