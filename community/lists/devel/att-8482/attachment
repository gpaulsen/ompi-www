<div class="gmail_quote">Hi all, 
<div>I tried to add a schedule algorithm to the pml component ,ob1 etc. Poorly I can only find a  paper named  &quot;Open MPI: A Flexible High Performance MPI&quot; and some annotation in the source file.  From them , I know ob1 has implemented   round-robin&amp; weighted distribution algorithm. But after tracking the MPI_Send(),I cann&#39;t figure out </div>

<div>the location of these implement ,let alone to add a new schedule algorithm. </div>
<div>I have two questions :</div>
<div>1.The location of the schedule algorithm ?</div>
<div>2.There are five components :cm,crcpw ,csum ,ob1,V in the pml framework . The function of these components?</div>
<div>Thank you !</div>
