&gt; Unfortunately, this (and <a href="https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/changeset/31588" target="_blank">https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/changeset/31588</a> that followed) represent a REGRESSION in that between 1.8.1 and 1.8.2rc2 Open MPI has lost support for F08 with the PGI compilers.<br>

<br>
Yes, and the answer is for PGI to support more of the F2003 standard.  Then there might be a hope for supporting the MPI F08 bindings.  :-)<br>
<br>
Glib answer aside...<br>
<br>
The fact of the matter is that Fortran compilers are a nightmare of what specific Fortran features they support.  As part of r31587 and r31588, there was a simplification made to the (already quite complex) F08 bindings in OMPI to only support Fortran compilers that support PROCEDURE.<br>

<br>
I don&#39;t think I realized that I would be cutting off PGI support with this change.<br>
<br>
That being said, unless someone really screams, I would greatly prefer not to put back in the &quot;support compilers who do not support PROCEDURE&quot; code because a) it creates the problem that we solved by taking that stuff out, b) it adds more complexity to the F08 bindings, and c) we&#39;ll have to solve the original problem a different way... and I don&#39;t know how to do that.  :-\<br>
