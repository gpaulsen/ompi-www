Short version<br>
=============<br>
<br>
The Github conversion is complete. &nbsp;All OMPI activity is now at Github. &nbsp;Please&nbsp;read the wiki, particularly the first few pages that deal specifically with&nbsp;Git/Github:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/wiki">https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/wiki</a><br>
<br>
You can safely re-enable your &quot;watch&quot; settings on our main repos now:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi">https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi</a><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi-release">https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi-release</a><br>
<br>
&quot;make dist&quot; and nightly tarballs are not quite functional yet; I am getting tangled&nbsp;up in version numbering, and did not finish it last night. &nbsp;But everything else&nbsp;seems to be working.<br>
<br>
Several people need to file pull requests to replace their still-open CMRs that&nbsp;were orphaned at Trac.<br>
<br>
A few people need to accept their Github &quot;ompi&quot; invitations so that Github Issues&nbsp;can be assigned to them:<br>
<br>
More detail<br>
===========<br>
<br>
1. The following people need to accept the OMPI GitHub invite email so that issues&nbsp;can be assigned to them:<br>
<br>
- Manjunath Gorentla Venkata<br>
- Vasily Philipov<br>
<br>
Please tell me when you've accepted so that I can assign the proper issue(s) to&nbsp;you.<br>
<br>
2. The following still-open CMRs were not brought over, and need to be re-filed as&nbsp;pull requests:<br>
<br>
- <a href="https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/ticket/4216:">https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/ticket/4216:</a> Nathan (BLOCKER)<br>
- <a href="https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/ticket/4816:">https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/ticket/4816:</a> Ralph<br>
- <a href="https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/ticket/4872:">https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/ticket/4872:</a> Ralph<br>
- <a href="https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/ticket/4888:">https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/ticket/4888:</a> Howard<br>
- <a href="https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/ticket/4900:">https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/ticket/4900:</a> Ralph<br>

3. As mentioned above, you can safely start watching the ompi and ompi-release&nbsp;repos again. &nbsp;You can pick either:<br>
<br>
3a. &quot;Watching&quot;, which means you'll get an email for every issue/pull request, or<br>
3b. &quot;Not watching&quot;, which means you'll only get an email if someone @mentions you,&nbsp;or an issue is assigned to you.<br>
<br>
*** If you want to receive emails for every issue filed, you want &quot;Watching&quot;. &nbsp;The&nbsp;old &quot;bugs&quot; email list does not exist any longer.<br>
*** You almost certainly *don't* want &quot;Ignoring&quot;, which means you won't ever get&nbsp;emails, even if someone @mentions or, or an issue is assigned to you.<br>
<br>
4. If you hadn't noticed already, mails about commits to the following repos are&nbsp;now sent to the
<a href="mailto:ompi-commits@open-mpi.org">ompi-commits@open-mpi.org</a> mailman list:<br>
<br>
4a. ompi<br>
4b. ompi-release<br>
4c. ompi-tests<br>
4d. ompi-www<br>
4e. ompi-docs<br>
<br>
The &quot;svn&quot; and &quot;svn-full&quot; mailman lists no longer exist. &nbsp;If we want to split up&nbsp;where the commits go to be more fine-grained than that, we can.<br>
<br>
5. As mentioned above, &quot;make dist&quot; and friends is currently broken. &nbsp;Don't bother&nbsp;trying it; I'm partway through fixing it, but it's subtle and complicated, and I'm&nbsp;was too brain fried last night to finish it correctly. &nbsp;More fixing in this area&nbsp;coming soon...<br>
<br>
6. After you read the wiki about git/GitHub usage (<a href="https://github.com/open-">https://github.com/open-</a>mpi/ompi/wiki), please let me know if you run into any problems (unrelated to &quot;make&nbsp;dist&quot; and version numbers) and/or have any questions.<br>
