    Hello,<br>
    <br>
    I have been having some problems with connect and disconnect between
    two processes. The processes seem to be indefinitely blocking at
    Connect/Accept stage or at Disconnect stage. For example<br>
    <br>
    Process A<br>
    {<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MPI_Open_port(...);<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MPI_Publish_name(...);<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MPI_Comm_accept(... &amp;b_comm);&nbsp; // -----&gt; (1)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Do something1<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MPI_Comm_disconnect(&amp;b_comm);&nbsp; // ------&gt; (2)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Do something2<br>
    <br>
    }<br>
    <br>
    Process B<br>
    {<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MPI_Lookup_name(...);<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MPI_Comm_connect(... &amp;a_comm); // -----&gt; (1)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Do something1<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MPI_Comm_disconnect(&amp;a_comm); // ------&gt; (2)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Do something2<br>
    }<br>
    <br>
    In the above scenario, in a perfect case where A reaches (1) without
    any problems, *<b>sometimes</b>* B blocks at its (1) indefinitely.
    All arguments passed to both the functions are perfect.<br>
    Again, *<b>sometimes</b>* one of them block infinitely at (2) while
    the other goes on to do the something2. This could only be a problem
    at the application level only if the one that blocks indefinitely is
    always the same but it is not so. Sometimes A blocks and B is busy
    doing something2 or A is busy doing its something2 while B blocks.
    Perhaps there is any work around for this already?<br>
    <br>
    Thanks,<br>
