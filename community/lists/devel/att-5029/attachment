Alas, we have encountered a blocking defect which is preventing us from releasing today. &nbsp;If we are able to resolve this defect in the next couple of days, we will work to have the fix in a new release candidate by the end of the week. &nbsp;And if that tests well over the weekend, then we will be on track for a release on Dec. 16. &nbsp;However, if it is not resolved by the end of the week, the reality is that this release will then most likely slip to January. &nbsp;<div>

Open MPI v1.3 is close to being ready for release. &nbsp;The remaining defects are being worked and our goal is to have those wrapped up and v1.3 officially released on December 9. &nbsp;Here is the schedule leading up to the final release:<div>

<br><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;December 2: RC1</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;December 5: RC2</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;December 9: 1.3 Release</div><div><br></div><div>This has been a long effort involving many developers and organizations and the release cycle has been frustratingly long, but after one more push, we should have this out the door. &nbsp;In order to help ensure the release goes smoothly, please take some time to download and do some basic sanity checks on the release candidates as they become available.</div>
