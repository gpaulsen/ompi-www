<div dir="ltr">Hi folks<div><br></div><div>We are planning to begin the 1.10.2 release process early next week, with the intent of creating a release candidate and then letting it &quot;bake&quot; across the holidays. I&#39;m seeing a lot of activity (good!) and a few issues being reported on the user mailing list regarding 1.10.1. Could people please:</div><div><br></div><div>(a) ensure that the issues being raised on the user list are being transitioned to GitHub issues tagged with the 1.10.2 milestone so we can accurately know our status?</div><div><br></div><div>(b) likewise make a note of which issues being raised internally might impact 1.10? I&#39;m trying to follow the chains as best I can while on travel this week, and I believe most are only relevant to the 2.x series, but I can&#39;t tell for sure in all cases.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks</div><div>Ralph</div><div><br></div></div>
