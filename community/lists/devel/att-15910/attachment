Bitbucket pricing model is per user (but with free public/private<br>
repository up to 5 users)<br>
whereas github pricing is per *private* repository (and free public<br>
repository and with unlimited users)<br>
<br>
from an OpenMPI point of view, this means :<br>
- with github, only the private ompi-tests repository requires a fee<br>
- with bitbucket, the ompi repository requires a fee (there are 119<br>
users in <a href="https://github.com/open-mpi/authors/blob/master/authors.txt" target="_blank">https://github.com/open-mpi/authors/blob/master/authors.txt</a>, in<br>
bitbucket pricing model, that means unlimited users and this is 200US$<br>
per month)<br>
<br>
per branch ACL is a feature that was requested loooong time ago on<br>
bitbucket, and now they implemented it, i would not expect it takes<br>
too much time before github implements it too.<br>
<br>
from the documentation, gerrithub has also interesting features :<br>
- force the use of a workflow (assuming the workflow is a good match<br>
with how we want to work ...)<br>
- prevent developers from commiting a huge mess to github<br>

&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t have experience with GerritHub, but Bitbucket supports this<br>
&gt;&gt; feature (permissions on branch names/globs) and we use it in PETSc.<br>
&gt; Thanks for the info.  Paul Hargrove said pretty much the same thing to me, off-list.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I&#39;ll check it out.<br>
