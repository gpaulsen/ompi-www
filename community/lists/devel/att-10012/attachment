      The error you are seeing is usually indicative of some code
      operating on memory that isn't aligned properly for a SPARC
      instruction being used.&nbsp; The address that is causing the failure
      is odd aligned which is more than likely the culprit.&nbsp; If you have
      a core dump and can disassemble the code that is being ran at the
      time it probably will be some sort of instruction requiring an
      alignment.&nbsp; If the MPI you are using is something you built can
      you try and build OMPI with -g and get the line number in the PML
      that is failing?<br>

      I haven't seen this type of error for some time but I do all of my
      SPARC testing on Solaris with Solaris Studio Compilers.&nbsp; You may
      want to try to compile the benchmark with "-m32" to see if that
      helps.&nbsp; Though being an odd address I suspect it might not.&nbsp; If
      you can use the Studio Compilers you could try giving the
      compilers the -xmemalign=8i option when building the benchmark and
      see if that resolves the issue.&nbsp; This would help to assure the
      issue is just an alignment of data we are slicing and dicing as
      opposed to wrongly addressing memory.<br>

    After thinking about this you probably won't be able to use the
    Studio Compilers because they only support compiling on Linux with
    x86 platforms not Linux with SPARC.&nbsp; Not sure if gcc has anything
    like the xmemalign options.<br>
