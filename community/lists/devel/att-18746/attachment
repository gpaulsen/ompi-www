Sorry :-(Â  )<br><br></div>Let&#39;s say my cluster has 7 nodes, connected via IP-over-Ethernet for control traffic and some kind of raw verbs (or anything else such as SRIO) interface for data transfer. Let&#39;s say my host file chooses 4 out of the 7 nodes for an MPI job, based on the IP address, which are assigned to the Ethernet interfaces.<br><br></div>My question is: where in the code does this mapping between IP-to-whatever_interface_is_used_for_MPI_Send/Recv is determined, such as only those chosen nodes receive traffic over the verbs interface?<br><br></div>Thanks in advance<br></div>Durga<br><div><div><div><div><div><div><br clear="all"><div><div class="gmail_signature"><div dir="ltr"><div>We learn from history that we never learn from history.<br></div></div></div></div>
