I found one major negative to this change - it assumes that my build is being done in exclusion of anything else on my computer. Unfortunately, this is never true.<div><br></div><div>So my laptop hemorrhaged itself into frozen silence, overheated to the point of being burning hot, and had to have its battery yanked to stop the runaway behavior.

<div><br></div><div>I would suggest you default this &quot;heuristic&quot; out, and let someone set it to use multiple runs if-and-only-if they want it. Hate to cite the lowest common denominator, but this was a very nasty surprise.</div>

Some of you may be unaware that recent versions of automake can run in parallel.  That is, automake will run in parallel with a degree of (at most) $AUTOMAKE_JOBS.  This can speed up the execution time of <a href="http://autogen.pl" target="_blank">autogen.pl</a> quite a bit on some platforms.  On my cluster at cisco, here&#39;s a few quick timings of the entire <a href="http://autogen.pl" target="_blank">autogen.pl</a> process (of which, automake is the bottleneck):<br>

<br>
$AUTOMAKE_JOBS           Total wall time<br>
value                    of <a href="http://autogen.pl" target="_blank">autogen.pl</a><br>
8                        3:01.46<br>
4                        2:55.57<br>
2                        3:28.09<br>
1                        4:38.44<br>
<br>
This is an older Xeon machine with 2 sockets, each with 2 cores.<br>
<br>
There&#39;s a nice performance jump from 1 to 2, and a smaller jump from 2 to 4.  4 and 8 are close enough to not matter.  YMMV.<br>
<br>
I just committed a heuristic to <a href="http://autogen.pl" target="_blank">autogen.pl</a> to setenv AUTOMAKE_JOBS if it is not already set (<a href="https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/changeset/23788" target="_blank">https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/changeset/23788</a>):<br>

<br>
- If lstopo is found in your $PATH, runs it and count how many PU&#39;s (processing units) you have.  It&#39;ll set AUTOMAKE_JOBS to that number, or a maximum of 4 (which is admittedly a further heuristic).<br>
- If lstopo is not found, it just sets AUTOMAKE_JOBS to 2.<br>
<br>
Enjoy.<br>
