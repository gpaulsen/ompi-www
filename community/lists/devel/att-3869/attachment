Hi,<br><br>I&#39;m finishing the implementation of a MTL module but something went wrong. This module is using PML/cm and the Recv operations are hanging in the ompi_request_wait_completion() call in pml_cm_recv.c:mca_pml_cm_recv(). I think that I must set the variable recvreq-&gt;req_base.req_ompi.req_complete somewhere but I don&#39;t know exactly where is the right place. When I comment out the ompi_request_wait_completion() call the application messages are delivered correctly with my backend.<br>
<br>Regards,<br>Caciano<br>
