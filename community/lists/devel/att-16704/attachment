<br>
v1.8.4 is a bug fix release.  All users are encouraged to upgrade to v1.8.4 when possible.<br>
<br>
Version 1.8.4 can be downloaded from the main Open MPI web site or any of its mirrors  (mirrors will be updating shortly).<br>
<br>
Here is a list of changes in v1.8.4 as compared to v1.8.3:<br>
<br>
- Fix MPI_SIZEOF; now available in mpif.h for modern Fortran compilers<br>
  (see README for more details).  Also fixed various compiler/linker<br>
  errors.<br>
- Fixed inadvertant Fortran ABI break between v1.8.1 and v1.8.2 in the<br>
  mpi interface module when compiled with gfortran &gt;= v4.9.<br>
- Fix various MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE issues in the TCP BTL.<br>
- mpirun no longer requires the --hetero-nodes switch; it will<br>
  automatically detect when running in heterogeneous scenarios.<br>
- Update LSF support, to include revamped affinity functionality.<br>
- Update embedded hwloc to v1.9.1.<br>
- Fixed max registerable memory computation in the openib BTL.<br>
- Updated error message when debuggers are unable to find various<br>
  symbols/types to be more clear.  Thanks to Dave Love for raising the<br>
  issue.<br>
- Added proper support for LSF and PBS/Torque libraries in static builds.<br>
- Rankfiles now support physical processor IDs.<br>
- Fixed potential hang in MPI_ABORT.<br>
- Fixed problems with the PSM MTL and &quot;re-connect&quot; scenarios, such as<br>
  MPI_INTERCOMM_CREATE.<br>
- Fix MPI_IREDUCE_SCATTER with a single process.<br>
- Fix (rare) race condition in stdout/stderr funneling to mpirun where<br>
  some trailing output could get lost when a process terminated.<br>
- Removed inadvertent change that set --enable-mpi-thread-multiple &quot;on&quot;<br>
  by default, thus impacting performance for non-threaded apps.<br>
- Significantly reduced startup time by optimizing internal hash table<br>
  implementation.<br>
- Fixed OS X linking with the Fortran mpi module when used with<br>
  gfortran &gt;= 4.9.  Thanks to Github user yafshar for raising the<br>
  issue.<br>
- Fixed memory leak on Cygwin platforms.  Thanks for Marco Atzeri for<br>
  reporting the issue.<br>
- Fixed seg fault in neighborhood collectives when the degree of the<br>
  topology is higher than the communicator size.  Thanks to Lisandro<br>
  Dalcin for reporting the issue.<br>
- Fixed segfault in neighborhood collectives under certain use-cases.<br>
- Fixed various issues regarding Solaris support.  Thanks to Siegmar<br>
  Gross for patiently identifying all the issues.<br>
- Fixed PMI configure tests for certain Slurm installation patterns.<br>
- Fixed param registration issue in Java bindings.  Thanks to Takahiro<br>
  Kawashima and Siegmar Gross for identifying the issue.<br>
- Several man page fixes.<br>
- Silence several warnings and close some memory leaks (more remain,<br>
  but it&#39;s better than it was).<br>
- Re-enabled the use of CMA and knem in the shared memory BTL.<br>
- Updated mpirun manpage to correctly explain new map/rank/binding options.<br>
- Fixed MPI_IALLGATHER problem with intercommunicators.  Thanks for<br>
  Takahiro Kawashima for the patch.<br>
- Numerous updates and performance improvements to OpenSHMEM.<br>
- Turned off message coalescing in the openib BTL until a proper fix<br>
  for that capability can be provided (tentatively expected for 1.8.5)<br>
- Fix a bug in iof output that dates back to the dinosaurs which would<br>
  output extra bytes if the system was very heavily loaded<br>
- Fix a bug where specifying mca_component_show_load_errors=0 could<br>
  cause ompi_info to segfault<br>
- Updated valgrind suppression file<br>
