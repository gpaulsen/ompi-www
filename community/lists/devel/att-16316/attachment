      the reply you pointed is a bit confusing to me :<br>
      <br>
      &quot;There is a native C API which can submit/start/stop/kill/re queue
      jobs&quot;<br>
      this is not what i am looking for :-(<br>
      <br>
      &quot;you need to make an appropriate call to openlava to start a
      remote process&quot;<br>
      this is what i am interested in :-)<br>
      could you be more specific (e.g. point me to the functions, since
      the OpenLava doc is pretty minimal ...)<br>
      <br>
      the goal here is to spawn the orted daemons as part of the
      parallel job,<br>
      so these daemons are accounted within the parallel job.<br>
      /* if we use an API that simply spawns orted, but the orted is not
      related whatsoever to the parallel job,<br>
      then we can simply use ssh */<br>
      <br>

      <pre>Hi Gilles, 

thanks for the prompt reply. Yes, as far as I know there is a C API to interact with jobs etc. Some mentioning here: <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/openlava-users/w74cRUe9Y9E" target="_blank">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/openlava-users/w74cRUe9Y9E</a> <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/openlava-users/w74cRUe9Y9E" target="_blank">&lt;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/openlava-users/w74cRUe9Y9E&gt;</a><div><div class="h5">

Hi Marc,

OpenLava is based on a pretty old version of LSF (4.x if i remember
correctly)
and i do not think LSF had support for parallel jobs tight integration
at that time.

my understanding is that basically, there is two kind of direct
integration :
- mpirun launch: mpirun spawns orted via the API provided by the batch
manager
- direct launch: the mpi tasks are launched directly from the
script/command line and no mpirun/orted is involved
 at that time, it works with SLURM and possibly other PMI capable batch
manager

i think OpenLava simply gets a list of hosts from the environment, build
a machinefile, pass it to mpirun that spawns orted with ssh, so this is
really loose integration.

OpenMPI is based on plugins, so as long as the queing system provides an
API to start/stop/kill tasks, mpirun launch should not
be a huge effort.

Are you aware of such an API provided by OpenLava ?

Cheers,

Gilles

          <pre>Hi list,

I have recently started to wonder how hard it would be to add support for queuing systems to the tight integration function of OpenMPI (unfortunately, I am not a developer myself). Specifically, we are working with OpenLava (<a href="http://www.openlava.org" target="_blank">www.openlava.org</a>), which is based on an early version of Lava/LSF and open source. It’s proven quite useful in environments where some level of LSF compatibility is needed, but without actually paying for a (rather pricey) LSF license. 

Given that openLava shares quite a bit of DNA with LSF, I was wondering how hard it would be to add OL tight integration support to OpenMPI. Currently, OL enables OpenMPI jobs through a wrapper script, but that’s obviously not ideal and doesn’t work for some programs that have MPI support built-in (and thus expect to be able to just execute mpirun). 

Any thoughts on this would be greatly appreciated!

Regards,

Marc
