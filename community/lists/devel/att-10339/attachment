      Well, not quite...
      <br>
      <br>
      I've SUCCESSFULLY retested 44 out of the 55 cpu/os/compiler/abi
      combinations currently on my list.
      <br>
      I expect 9 more by the end of the day (the older/slower hosts),
      but two of my test hosts are down.
      <br>
      <br>
      So far I see only two problems that remain:
      <br>
      <br>
      + I can't build w/ the PGI compilers on MacOS Lion.
      <br>
      This was previously reported in

      <br>
      <br>
      + Building w/ Solaris Studio 12.2 or 12.3 on Linux x86-64, with
      "-m32" required setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
      <br>
    </blockquote>
    Can the LD_LIBRARY_PATH be substituted with a rpath change in
    LDFLAGS of the build?<br>

    I thought I responded to the above issue.&nbsp; I think this may be a OS
    distribution (Solaris Studio assumption) issue.&nbsp; On my RH system
    /lib contains the 32 libraries and /lib64 has the 64 bit libs.&nbsp; I
    assume your system may have it the other way around (/lib = 64 bit
    libs and /lib32 has 32 bit).&nbsp; Can you confirm that your /lib
    contains 64 bit libs.&nbsp; Also can you do a "cc -### -m32" compile and
    link of a simple program and confirm that the compiler is pulling in
    /lib (I am 99% certain it is).&nbsp; Also, is this /lib is 64 bit
    libraries a common thing, none of my Linux systems are set up this
    way.<br>
    <br>
    Anyways, I think maybe a note in the README is in store for such
    setups.&nbsp; <br>
