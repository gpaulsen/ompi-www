Sun's participation in this community was to obtain a stable and 
<br>
performant MPI implementation that had some research work done on the 
<br>
side to improve those goals and the introduction of new features.   We 
<br>
don't have problems with others using and improving on the OMPI code 
<br>
base but we need to make sure such usage doesn't detract from our 
<br>
primary goal of performant MPI implementation.
<br>
<p>However, changes to the OMPI code base to allow it to morph or even 
<br>
support a distributed OS does cause for some concern.  That is are we 
<br>
opening the door to having more interfaces to support?  If so is this 
<br>
wise in the fact that it seems to me we have a hard enough time trying 
<br>
to focus on the MPI items?  Not to mention this definitely starts 
<br>
detracting from the original goals.

<span class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi all -- There is a meta question that I think is underlying some of

</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; distributed OS with an MPI interface?  It seems like some of the

<span class="quotelev1">&gt; changes being asked for (e.g., with the BTLs) reflect the latter --

<span class="quotelev1">&gt; mismatch.

</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; I doubt this is the last time that tensions will come up because of

<span class="quotelev1">&gt; differing views on this question.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; I suggest that we come to some kind of common understanding of the

<span class="quotelev1">&gt; accordingly.
