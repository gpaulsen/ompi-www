Hi Eugene,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have licenses of HPMPI, IntelMPI and SpecMPI with us. We 
<br>
usually do comparison tests periodically like recently we did collective 
<br>
performance test on our cluster.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to help openmpi community to benchmark their 
<br>
collectives and other calls if given the opportunity. I am using openmpi 
<br>
from last 2 years and have decent understanding of its code-base.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it would be interesting as well as challenging stuff to 
<br>
make openmpi better then all existing MPI flavours and i would love to 
<br>
work in this direction.
<br>
<p>Regards

[OMPI devel] OMPI performance competitiveness
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p><p>A few of us have been discussing OMPI's performance competitiveness 
<br>
recently and the possibility of organizing an effort within the OMPI 
<br>
community to assess better where we stand (potentially in an automated 
<br>
basis, such as through MTT).
<br>
<p>Does anyone have licenses for other MPI implementations (HP, Intel, 
<br>
Platform/Scali, etc.) or individual test suites (SpecMPI, etc.)?
<br>
<p>Let me (or the mail alias) know if you're interested in such work or 
<br>
have other feedback.
