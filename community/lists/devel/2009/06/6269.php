<p>Thanks!  We try.

<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt; Also I would like to suggest one or may be two things.

<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; 1. First of all i would like to suggest a different mailing list for

<span class="quotelev1">&gt; students like me who wants to learn about openMPI. Since questions  
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; from someone like is going to be simpler than those of other

<span class="quotelev1">&gt; professional developers. Maybe the students from the  student  
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; mailing list can solve it. If not we can post in the developers  
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; mailing list. I think this will limit the email in the developers  
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; list.
</span><br>
<p>I think we're ok with just users + devel.  devel is meant to be for  
<br>
all level of developers -- newbie to experienced OMPI developer.  It  
<br>
can make for a lot of traffic sometimes, but it's better if the  
<br>
experienced OMPI developers are here to answer complex questions  
<br>
rather than have incorrect answers floating around as absolute truth.   
<br>
Indeed, sometimes when I answer questions, I double check with some of  
<br>
other OMPI developers to ensure that my answer is correct (OMPI is a  
<br>
big code base; even I don't know all of it).
<br>
<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. Secondly if the developer could volunteer to become mentors for  
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; student (particularly thesis student like m e :) ). I think they  
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; would benefit a lot.
</span><br>
<p><p>As Eugene mentioned, I think we're an active community, but I don't  
<br>
think we're big enough to have a formal mentoring program.  :-(  I  
<br>
think the ad-hoc relationships are probably the best that we can do at  
<br>
the moment.
