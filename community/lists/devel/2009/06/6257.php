Hi Eugene,

I was just thinking about Ubuntu's MOTU initiative. [<a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU/Mentoring">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU/Mentoring</a>]  when i talked about mentoring program for openMPI. 

Also i thought the user mailing list was for talking about user's level program not the things related to core openMPI functions and soon.

And yes i have observed how adhoc relationship spring up in openMPI community.  :)

Regards,
Leo. P

I
found openMPI community filled with co-operative and helpful people.
And would like to thank them through this email [Nik, Eugene, Ralph,
Mitchel and others]. 

You are very gracious.

Also
I would like to suggest one or may be two things.

1. First of all i would like to suggest a different mailing list for
students like me who wants to learn about openMPI. Since questions from
someone like is going to be simpler than those of other professional
developers. Maybe the students from the  student mailing list can solve
it. If not we can post in the developers mailing list. I think this
will limit the email in the developers list. 

I think there is already such a list.  It's the &quot;users&quot; (rather than
&quot;devel&quot;) list.

2.
Secondly if the developer could volunteer to become mentors for student
(particularly thesis student like m e :) ). I think they would benefit
a lot. 

Perhaps some of those relationships spring up &quot;ad hoc&quot; on the mail
list, as you have already observed.
