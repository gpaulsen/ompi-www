<p>
Just to be clear, Ralf - I'm not advocating that we change build  
<br>
systems. I agree it has been a good relationship, and your  
<br>
participation has been welcome and extremely helpful.
<br>
<p>My point was only that the GPL continues to evolve and seems to be  
<br>
growing more aggressive in its &quot;viral&quot; clauses, which makes it harder  
<br>
to work with those packages without getting &quot;assimilated&quot;, as the Borg  
<br>
would say.
<br>
<p>Thus, it may at some point become necessary to change, even though  
<br>
nobody really wants to suffer the pain of doing so. I'm not sure if  
<br>
these new changes represent that point or not - but it is something we  
<br>
may need to consider, especially if the GPL continues to grow more  
<br>
viral in the future.
<br>
