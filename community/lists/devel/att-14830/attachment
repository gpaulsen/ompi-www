      r31829 caused many sigsegv :-(<br>
      /* i am testing on a RHEL6.3 like VM with --mca btl,tcp */<br>
      <br>
      this is now fixed in r31830,<br>
      i think i get the intent of the code and i believe we are all set
      now.<br>
      <br>
      bottom line :<br>
      - we agree on line 487 (e.g. use btl_send)<br>
      - your update of line 485 is correct (e.g. use btl_send)<br>
      - my suggested update of line 498 (e.g. use btl_send) was correct.<br>
      <br>
      Cheers,<br>

        <pre wrap="">   Nathan,

   do you mean the bug/typo was not at line 487
   (e.g. btl_send was ok)
   but at line 498 ?
   (e.g. btl_send must be used instead of btl_eager)

Yup. If you look at the next loop (L497) it looks through the btl_send
list and then calls del_procs if it finds the btl in that list.

        <pre wrap="">   at first sight, that make sense.

   i'd rather let the author/maintainer of this part comment on that

I don't know if the original author still works on Open MPI. I think we
will have to guess the intent of the code. Let me take a closer look and
see if I can determine for sure what was intended. If I can determine
for sure I will include this change with another bml fix that needs to
go in.
