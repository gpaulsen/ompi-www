<p>
During today's telecon, we discussed the need to continue making progress on full support for MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE. The next obstacle is to have the BTLs moved down to the OPAL layer. This is viewed as a &quot;blocker&quot; to any further progress on this issue.
<br>
<p>We know that UTK was working on this, but may have hit a roadblock since we haven't heard or seen anything. Anyone from there able to give us an update? Is there something that is creating the roadblock that we can help resolve?
<br>
<p>If we can get access to your repo, or a patch from your current state, I'm willing to complete the work. I can start from scratch if necessary, but that seems wasteful as I believe you're pretty close.
<br>
<p>Either way, we need to get this blocker out of the way as the thread_multiple support needs to get done. Several of us are going to review the notes from the last meeting and execute the parts that we can in the interim.
<br>
<p>Thanks
<br>
Ralph
