<br>
<p>SUBMISSION DEADLINE:
<br>
<p>May 31, 2013 - LNCS Full paper submission (rolling abstract submission)
<br>

<br>
<p><p>SCOPE
<br>
<p>Extremely large, diverse, and complex data sets are generated from
<br>
scientific applications, the Internet, social media and other applications.
<br>
Data may be physically distributed and shared by an ever larger community.
<br>
Collecting, aggregating, storing and analyzing large data volumes
<br>
presents major challenges. Processing such amounts of data efficiently
<br>
has been an issue to scientific discovery and technological
<br>
advancement. In addition, making the data accessible, understandable and
<br>
interoperable includes unsolved problems. Novel middleware architectures,
<br>
algorithms, and application development frameworks are required.
<br>
<p>In this workshop we are particularly interested in original work at the
<br>
intersection of HPC and Big Data with regard to middleware handling
<br>
and optimizations. Scope is existing and proposed middleware for HPC
<br>
and big data, including analytics libraries and frameworks.
<br>
<p>The goal of this workshop is to bring together software architects,
<br>
middleware and framework developers, data-intensive application developers
<br>
as well as users from the scientific and engineering community to exchange
<br>
their experience in processing large datasets and to report their scientific
<br>
achievement and innovative ideas. The workshop also offers a dedicated forum
<br>
for these researchers to access the state of the art, to discuss problems
<br>
and requirements, to identify gaps in current and planned designs, and to
<br>
collaborate in strategies for scalable data-intensive computing.
<br>
<p>The workshop will be one day in length, composed of 20 min paper
<br>
presentations, each followed by 10 min discussion sections.
<br>
Presentations may be accompanied by interactive demonstrations.
<br>
<p><p>TOPICS
<br>

<br>
- Execution engines, languages and environments including CIEL/Skywriting
<br>
- Performance analysis, evaluation of data-intensive middleware
<br>
- In-depth analysis and performance optimizations in existing data-handling
<br>
middleware, focusing on indexing/fast storing or retrieval between compute
<br>
and storage nodes
<br>
- Highly scalable middleware optimized for minimum communication
<br>
- Use cases and experience for popular Big Data middleware
<br>
- Middleware security, privacy and trust architectures
