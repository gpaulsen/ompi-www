Hi folks
<br>
<p>As you may have noticed, v1.7.0 was dead-on-arrival due to a couple of errors that had been hanging around for awhile, but failed to get fixed or CMR'd. In fairness, a ticket for at least one of those issues was never filed (just reported on devel). The other problem was just a missed changeset on an existing CMR :-(
<br>
<p>This means we need a quick-turn v1.7.1 release. I created a 1.7.2 milestone and moved the obvious &quot;new feature&quot; CMRs to it as we want this next release to be purely bug fixes - we need the blasted thing to build and work out-of-the-box!
<br>
<p>Please take a moment to review the existing CMRs under v1.7.1 and (a) ensure they are relatively safe bug fixes, and (b) review them if possible as most are stuck waiting for someone to say &quot;okay&quot;.
<br>
<p>I haven't had a chance to connect with Brian yet, but I would guess we will want to release 1.7.1 next week - and this time, to have it be a successful release.
<br>
<p>Thanks
<br>
Ralph
