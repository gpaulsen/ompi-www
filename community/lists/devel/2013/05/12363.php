<p>All are free to attend, but you'll need to endure some deep-mojo discussions of the innards of Open MPI.  :-)
<br>
<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt; Will there be a social event that I could attend?  
</span><br>
<p>We typically do something informally scheduled on the day of, or somesuch (e.g., around 4pm people start wondering aloud what we should do for dinner :-) ).  But if there is interest for others to attend, we can probably set up something ahead of time.
<br>
<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe there is one at the MPI Forum?  
</span><br>
<p>Same situation at the Forum -- we argu^H^H^H^Hdiscuss all day, and then discuss what to do for dinner, and then head out, usually in smaller groups.
<br>
<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt; Because of the US budget sequestration, I cannot spend any money, unless I do it on my own (in which case I have to bend over backwards to obscure my government affiliation -- like no mention of USGS on my registration or name badge).
</span><br>
<p>The OMPI meeting will have no registration fee.  The MPI Forum meeting has a registration fee, but if you just wanted to come to chat, observe, and not be on track to vote (voting means you have to register and attend at least 2 out of 3 consecutive meetings), you're more than welcome to come.
