<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt; Personally, even though I'm one of the 1.7 release managers, I'm a little leery of recommending it for a production installation until we get further down the road. You might consider installing 1.6 as your &quot;base&quot; release, and then offering 1.7 to those who want to explore its new features?

<p><p>If you have the resources, +1 on this suggestion.

<p>Given that we know there are compile bugs with XRC in all the v1.7 releases so far (which seems to show how few people are actually using XRC...), there are definitely &quot;growing pains&quot;, as Ralph mentioned.  But there's also much newer functionality, such as MPI-3 stuff.

<p>It's never an easy black/white answer, is it?  Sorry!
