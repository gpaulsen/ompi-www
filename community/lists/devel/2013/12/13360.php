Dear Ralph,
<br>
<p>do you know if Open MPI already have commiters in Munich? Any contact in 
<br>
the Technical University of Munich or the LRZ compute center could be 
<br>
easily reachable by us.
<br>
<p>In any case, I will need to get familiar with the internals of the 
<br>
library first.  I am happy to say that the communication here has so far 
<br>
left a good impression.  Thanks.
<br>

<span class="quotelev1">&gt; can be configured out if they do) and are self-maintained (i.e.,

<span class="quotelev1">&gt; they involve a change that essentially requires no ongoing maintenance).
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; So if you want to take a crack at this, I'd suggest taking one or two 
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; of most interest and sending us the required patch for review. If it 
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; looks like things fit well, then we (a) can absorb the patches, and 
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; (b) it would probably be worth your time to submit a contributor

<span class="quotelev1">&gt; agreement and join the team as full committers.

</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;              In particular, I would like to discuss about your
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;             implementation of the MPI tools interface and possibly
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;             contribute to it later on.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;         Sorry we missed you.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;     No problem; I had to be at a booth during times that overlapped
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;     with your session.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;         What did you want to discuss?  We actually have a full
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;         implementation of the MPI_T interface -- meaning that we have
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;         all the infrastructure in place for MPI_T control and
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;         performance variables.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;         1. The MPI_T control variables map directly to OMPI's MCA
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;         params, so we automatically expose oodles of cvars through
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;         MPI_T.  They're all read-only after MPI_INIT, however -- many
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;         things are setup during MPI_INIT and it would be quite a Big
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;         Deal if they were to change.  However, we pretty much
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;         *assumed* all cvars shouldn't change after INIT -- we didn't
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;         really audit to see if there were actually some cvars that
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;         could change after INIT. So there's work that could be done
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;         there (i.e., find cvars that could change after INIT, and/or
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;         evaluate the amount of work/change it would be to change some
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;         read-only cvars to be read-write, etc.).
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;         2. The MPI_T performance variables are new.  There's only a
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;         few created right now (e.g., in the Cisco usnic BTL).  But the
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;         field is pretty wide open here -- the infrastructure is there,
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;         but we're really not exposing much information yet.  There's
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;         lots that can be done here.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;         What did you have in mind?
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;     I think you made a good guess on what we would like to do here.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;      We are working on automatic tuning based on both modeling and
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;     empirical data.  One of our aims is to accelerate the data
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;     collection part (in this case related to MPI settings), by doing
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;     it online without the need of full application runs or restarts.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;     Right now we can modify MPI runtime parameters with IBM-MPI or
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;     Open MPI.  These require full restarts, since they are set as
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;     environment variables and are not modifiable after MPI_INIT.  With
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;     your MPIT implementation, we can do the same programmatically but
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;     cannot avoid the restarts or full runs.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;     We already did what you describe at the end of 1., but with a (1
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;     year old) snapshot of MPICH.  The idea was to identify which
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;     variables could be made modifiable at runtime, and whether there
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;     was any attainable performance as a result of tuning them.  We
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;     only explored point to point and collective communication
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;     parameters, and the results are encouraging.  There was no
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;     technical reason when picking MPICH for the first prototype.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;     With MPICH, we had to examine the code for things that were
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;     configurable.  It seems to me that in the case of Open MPI, most
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;     of the work is done and, as you point out, it may just be
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;     necessary to identify which ones can be made modifiable at runtime
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;     and at what development cost.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;     My main intention here is to see if other people are interested
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;     and will benefit from this.  Additionally, if the changes
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;     (patches) are taken by the project, we avoid running out of sync
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;     (which is what ended up happening with our MPICH modifications).
