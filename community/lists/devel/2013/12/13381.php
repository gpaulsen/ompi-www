All he is doing is pushing intermediate  steps upstream to maintain contact and gain familiarity. No harm done as the code isn't built by default.
<br>
<p>Broader design discussion can take place as we understand the problems

<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Jeff - you are jumping way ahead. I already said this needs further work to resolve blocking. These patches (per Adrian's email) just makes things compile

<span class="quotelev1">&gt; Fair enough.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; But in some ways, having uncompilable code is a *good* thing, because it tells you exactly where you need to work on the architecture.  Just updating it to *compile* removes that safeguard -- will you remember/re-find all those places where it *used* to block and convert the architecture to workaround the blocking?
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; I guess I'm saying: what exactly does updating it to compile get for us, if we know the code still won't work?  It seems like all we'll be doing is removing the grep-able places where we *know* we'll have to do work in the future.
