&gt; this was true if all external libraries were maintaining ABI compatibility indicator properly with libtool.<br>
&gt; Let`s check your favorite, libibverbs :), the version is always 0.0.0 in libibverbs.so.0.0.0 so openib btl will not fail on link.<br>
<br>
</div>?<br>

❯❯❯ ls -l /usr/lib/libibverbs*<br>

As you can see, my libibverbs has shared library version 1.0.0, not 0.0.0.<br>
<div class=""><br>
&gt; The libibverbs can have experimental verbs included but libibverbs version still will be indicating the libtool version is "0:0:0".<br>
<br>
</div>That's bad software release methodology. &nbsp;You should fix *that*.<br>
<br>
Shared libraries have version numbers for a reason. &nbsp;They should be used properly.<br>
<div class=""><br>
&gt; So, the only way for sysadmin/user to know if he has a right version of libibvers installed is to check verbs.getVersion() and see if it is matches to one which includes experimental verbs and then he will know that there is a problem.<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; but for us, the most powerful case is the one that you described: compare ompi_info output on head and compute node and warn user if differ.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Also, to provide an infrastructure to digitize release notes.<br>
<br>
</div>Sure -- registering an MCA param like I described does all of these things without needing any new infrastructure in OMPI. &nbsp;You could put such version numbers in today.<br>
