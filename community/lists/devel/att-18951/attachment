    <p>in the 1.7, 1.8 and 1.10 series ROMIO remains the default. In the
      upcomgin 2.x series, OMPIO will be the default, except for Lustre
      file systems, where we will stick with ROMIO as the primary
      resource.</p>
    <p>Regarding performance comparison, we ran numerous tests late last
      year and early this year. It really depends on the application
      scenario and the platform that you are using. If you want to know
      which one should you use, I would definitely suggest to stick with
      ROMIO in the 1.10 series, since many of the bug fixes of OMPIO
      that we did in the last two years could not be back-ported to the
      1.10 series for technical reasons. If you plan to switch to the
      2.x series, it might be easiest to just run a couple of tests and
      compare the performance for your application on your platform, and
      base your decision on that.<br>

        <div>1. During default build of OpenMPI, it looks like both <a
            moz-do-not-send="true" href="http://ompio.la">ompio.la</a>
          and <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="http://romio.la">romio.la</a>
          are built.Â  Which I/O MCA library is used and based on what is
          the decision taken ?</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div>2. Are there any statistics available to compare these two
          - OMPIO vs ROMIO ?</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div>I am using OpenMPI v1.10.1.</div>
