    Hi,<br>
    <br>
    the hostnames (or their IPs) are only used to ssh orted.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    if you use only the tcp btl :<br>
    <br>
    TCP *MPI* communications (vs OOB management communications) are
    handled by btl/tcp<br>
    by default, all usable interfaces are used, then messages are split
    (iirc, by ob1 pml) and then "fragments"<br>
    are sent using all interfaces.<br>
    <br>
    each interface has a latency and bandwidth that is used to split
    message into fragments.<br>
    (assuming it is correctly configured, 90% of a large message is sent
    over the 10GbE interface, and 10% is sent over the GbE interface)<br>
    <br>
    if you can explicitly list/blacklist interface<br>
    mpirun --mca btl_tcp_if_include ...<br>
    or<br>
    mpirun --mca btl_tcp_if_exclude ...<br>
    <br>
    (see ompi_info --all for the syntax)<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    but if you use several btls (for example tcp and openib), the btl(s)
    with the lower exclusivity are not used.<br>
    (for example, a large message is *not* split and send using native
    ib, IPoIB and GbE because the openib btl<br>
    has a higher exclusivity than the tcp btl)<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    did this answer your question ?<br>
    <br>
    Cheers,<br>
    <br>
    Gilles<br>

              Let's say my cluster has 7 nodes, connected via
              IP-over-Ethernet for control traffic and some kind of raw
              verbs (or anything else such as SRIO) interface for data
              transfer. Let's say my host file chooses 4 out of the 7
              nodes for an MPI job, based on the IP address, which are
              assigned to the Ethernet interfaces.<br>
              <br>
            </div>
            My question is: where in the code does this mapping between
            IP-to-whatever_interface_is_used_for_MPI_Send/Recv is
            determined, such as only those chosen nodes receive traffic
            over the verbs interface?<br>
            <br>

          Thanks in advance<br>
