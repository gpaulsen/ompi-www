Hi Ashley<br><br>Thanks! I would definitely be interested and will look at the tool. Meantime, I have filed a bunch of data on this in ticket #1944, so perhaps you might take a glance at that and offer some thoughts?<br><br>

If I may say this is exactly the type of problem the tool I have been<br>
working on recently aims to help with and I&#39;d be happy to help you<br>
through it.<br>
<br>
Firstly I&#39;d say of the three collectives you mention, MPI_Allgather,<br>
MPI_Reduce and MPI_Bcast one exhibit a many-to-many, one a many-to-one<br>
and the last a many-to-one communication pattern.  The scenario of a<br>
root process falling behind and getting swamped in comms is a plausible<br>
one for MPI_Reduce only but doesn&#39;t hold water with the other two.  You<br>
also don&#39;t mention if the loop is over a single collective or if you<br>
have loop calling a number of different collectives each iteration.<br>
<br>
padb, the tool I&#39;ve been working on has the ability to look at parallel<br>
jobs and report on the state of collective comms and should help narrow<br>
you down on erroneous processes and those simply blocked waiting for<br>
comms.  I&#39;d recommend using it to look at maybe four or five instances<br>
where the application has hung and look for any common features between<br>
them.<br>
<br>
Let me know if you are willing to try this route and I&#39;ll talk, the code<br>
is downloadable from <a href="http://padb.pittman.org.uk" target="_blank">http://padb.pittman.org.uk</a> and if you want the full<br>
collective functionality you&#39;ll need to patch openmp with the patch from<br>
