In my opinion, we still try to get to a stable 1.7.4. &nbsp;I think we can just keep the bar high (as you said in the meeting) about what types of fixes need to get into 1.7.4. &nbsp;I have been telling folks 1.7.4 would be ready "really soon" so the idea of folding in 1.7.5 CMRs and delaying it is less desirable to me.<br>

<br>
Can you remind me again about why the 1.8.0 by mid-March is a requirement?<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt;Hi folks<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;I think it is safe to say that we are not going to get a release candidate out<br>
&gt;tonight - more Fortran problems have surfaced, along with the need to<br>
&gt;complete the ROMIO review. I have therefore concluded we cannot release<br>
&gt;1.7.4 this week. This leaves us with a couple of options:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;1. continue down this path, hopefully releasing 1.7.4 sometime next week,<br>
&gt;followed by 1.7.5 in the latter half of Feb. The risk here is that any further<br>
&gt;slippage in 1.7.4/5 means that we will not release it as we must roll 1.8.0 by<br>
&gt;mid-March. I'm not too concerned about most of those cmr's as they could be<br>
&gt;considered minor bug fixes and pushed to the 1.8 series, but it leaves<br>
&gt;oshmem potentially pushed into 1.9.0.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;2. "promote" all the 1.7.5 cmr's into 1.7.4 and just do a single release before<br>
&gt;ending the series. This eases the immediate schedule crunch, but means we<br>
&gt;will have to deal with all the bugs that surface when we destabilize the 1.7<br>
&gt;branch again.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;I'm open to suggestions. Please be prepared to discuss at next Tues telecon.<br>
&gt;Ralph<br>
