Conversation: Follow up on the MPI Forum meeting
<br>
Subject: [mpi-21] Follow up on the MPI Forum meeting
<br>
<p>Here is a brief summary of the meeting held at SC07 in Reno.
<br>
<p>We decided to reconvene the MPI forum with the intent of producing the MPI
<br>
2.1, 2.2, and 3.0 documents (the actual number may end up being different).
<br>
<p>MPI 2.1, which is current is strictly a for clarification of the current 2.0
<br>
standard - no changes to the standard.  A new combined document of the 2.0
<br>
standard has been prepared, and will be put out soon for review.  There is
<br>
also an existing ballot on the MPI 2.1 web site, which is accessible from
<br>
the MPI forum web page (www.mpi-forum.org).  People are strongly encouraged
<br>
to send additional item for consideration to this mailing list, and we these
<br>
will be added for discussion.  We agreed that this clarification process
<br>
will be handled electronically.  I will also be looking for volunteers to
<br>
take primary responsibility for reviewing each chapter of the 2.0 standard,
<br>
and collecting input from others for these chapters.  I hope to send this
<br>
out in the next week or so.  The goal is to complete the 2.1 process by
<br>
July, 2007.
<br>
<p>MPI 2.2 is intended to introduce &quot;small&quot; additions to the standard, with the
<br>
flavor of obvious errors/omissions in the 2.0 interface.  This includes
<br>
items such as adding appropriate const declarations to interface parameters,
<br>
making it easier to send more than 2 GB, and the like.  I am sure there will
<br>
be plenty of discussion on what constitutes &quot;a small changes.  The goal is
<br>
to complete this process by Jan, 2008, and this will most likely be the
<br>
focus of our first face-to-face meeting.  We already started to compile this
<br>
list in our meeting in Reno, so please continue to add to this list.  At
<br>
this stage these items should be brought up on the mailing list, but I am
<br>
hoping to set up a bit more efficient process to make sure we capture all
<br>
the items of interest.
<br>
<p>MPI 3.0 (or what ever it is called) is where I expect most of the
<br>
discussions to take place, ad this is where we may make larger changes to
<br>
the standard to better support current and future applications.  Some of the
<br>
items that have already been brought up, that I believe fall in the category
<br>
include items such as improved one-sided communications, better support for
<br>
Generalized Requests, Non-blocking Collectives, support for Fault-Tolerance,
<br>
sub-setting functionality, ... (this is not an exhaustive list, and does not
<br>
reflect priorities)  The goal is to complete the 3.0 standard no later than
<br>
Jan, 2010, with a first round of approved changes (if we vote any in), but
<br>
Jan. 2008, so that implementations can start to change, if need be.  There
<br>
will be time to start discussing items in our first face to face meeting.
<br>
<p>We also decided to stick with the current voting procedures:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- One vote per organization
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- To vote, and organization must have been present in at least two of the
<br>
last three face-to-face meetings.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Votes are taken twice, in two consecutive meetings, with a &quot;reading&quot; at
<br>
an earlier meeting. (This will make it possible for any new organizations to
<br>
be become members before any final vote takes place)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Measures pass on simple majority.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Only items consistent with the charter can be considered.
<br>
<p>We decided that the face-to-face meetings will take place in Chicago, every
<br>
eight weeks, with a telecon mid-way.  The face to face meetings will start
<br>
around noon on Monday, and end around noon on Wed., and the telecons will be
<br>
up to four hours, as needed.  We are working on securing a meeting location,
<br>
and reduced hotel rates, and I hope to have this information out next week
<br>
(the week of 11/19/2007), so people can start to make hotel reservations.
<br>
We have set the first two meeting dates:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Jan 14-16, 2008
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;March 10-12, 2008
<br>
To help in future planning I have penciled in dates for the rest of the year
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;May 5-7, 2008
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;June 30 - July 2, 2008
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;August 25-27, 2008 (though we should consider having this meeting in
<br>
Europe about a week later, in conjunction with the Euro PVM/MPI meeting)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;October 20-22, 2008
<br>
and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;December 15-17, 2008.
<br>
<p>Several of us are working to see if we can secure funding to help pay for
<br>
these meetings, and will let people know if we are able to do so.  I we
<br>
can't, we will need to collect a fee for each meeting, to pay for the
<br>
meeting rooms, snacks, drinks, and any business costs that may need to be
<br>
incurred, such as photo-copying.
<br>
<p>Finally, please advertise this activity as widely as you can, as the more
<br>
input we get, the more likely we are to come improve on an already
<br>
successful endeavor.  In particular, it is very important that we get our
<br>
user community and the vendor community to be actively involved in this
<br>
process.  I am actively perusing the people I know in both these
<br>
communities, and would highly encourage others to do the same.
<br>
<p><p>Looking forward to a fun process,
<br>
Rich
