[cc sent to openmpi: please, openmpi developers, I really like your
<br>
project, but if that guy is part of your development effort, please send
<br>
somebody else who is not trolling on our mailinglist. I am very open to
<br>
working together with you in ironing out any issues you might encounter,
<br>
but spreading FUD about libev openly is not something I look forward to in
<br>
the future. Thanks for your attention].

<span class="quotelev1">&gt; I am saddened that you have responded with such ferocity -- calling me  
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; a liar and making several other derogatory statements.
</span><br>
<p>You itself admitted to acting like a dork and an idiot, and unfortunately
<br>
you didn't stop with your ignorance policy. It is nice and remarkable that
<br>
you apologised, but that doesn't give you a license to continue trolling.
<br>
<p>If you are saddened, maybe there is a learn-effect to act less like an
<br>
idiot in the future, but somehow I doubt it from reading this mail.
<br>
<p>You could have easily avoided the ferocity by not using your rethorics
<br>
(i.e. not being a liar), reading the documentation and listening to the
<br>
expert willingly explaining all of it.
<br>
<p>The fact that I wasted any time on you by patiently explaining thigs to
<br>
you again and again makes me not sad, but rather annoyed. People like you
<br>
are a bad thing for software projects, and I can only hope you either act
<br>
better when working on openmpi or that openmpi finds a way to route around
<br>
your damaging behaviour.
<br>
<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt; Your docs state:
</span><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The goal is to enable you to just copy the neecssary files into your
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;source directory without having to change even a single line in them,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so you can easily upgrade by simply copying (or having a checked-
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out copy of libev somewhere in your source tree).&quot;
<br>
<p>Indeed. And so far, the goal has been met **overwhelmingly well**, **to
<br>
the letter of the statement** (my emphasis), as *proven* by a number
<br>
of projects who do *exactly that*. Why you keep spreading fud about it
<br>
escapes me, but its an extremely unfair and hostile behaviour by you, and
<br>
something I will certainly not tolerate.
<br>
<p>The reason you keep repeating the opposite or cast doubt on the validity
<br>
of that statement is the reason for the perceived &quot;ferocity&quot;: you cannot
<br>
expect that repeating unsound arguments (or worse, spreading FUD) will
<br>
somehow make somebody else give in (except maybe to stop it by ignoring an
<br>
idiot).
<br>
<p>With me, it only has the effect of repeatedly explaining you why it's
<br>
wrong, each timer longer and with more force, as for some (never stated)
<br>
reason you never accept those arguments, nor did you ever explain your
<br>
reasons (or reasoning, if there is any) on why. To me, it decidedly looks
<br>
as if you only tried to push something into libev that you would like to
<br>
see, just because you like to see it, wether it makes technical sense or
<br>
not. You actually stated that a lot in this thread.
<br>
<p>If you find this saddening, maybe you should start listening to what
<br>
people tell you, instead of dismissing it and dumbly repeating your claims
<br>
without delivering any evidence.
<br>
<p>But if you keep spreading FUD about libev then you must not be surprised
<br>
if somebody else reacts accordingly by calling you a liar, because thats
<br>
what you are, after all.
<br>
<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt; Having a checked out copy of libev (or, more precisely, an expanded  
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; tarball) is exactly what I want.
</span><br>
<p>It works for lots of other projects, and it would work for openmpi, as has
<br>
been explained many times.
<br>
<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt; And I wanted to use your Makefile.am.
</span><br>
<p>And I explained why this is not a good idea (mostly because it doesn't
<br>
work). The fact that you ignored all that and keep repeating that you wnat
<br>
to do the wrong thing despite being told repeatedly that it is not the
<br>
right approach
<br>
<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt; I have tried to explain why, I have given code examples,  
</span><br>
<p>Thats an outright lie, I asked you many times to explain why, but you
<br>
never explained it. You repeatedly said &quot;you want this&quot; and &quot;you need
<br>
this&quot;, but these are not reasons, which you did not deliver. The exampels
<br>
you gave were either incorrect, didn't solve the problem as claimed, or
<br>
degraded the quality of the library (by complicating and fixing things
<br>
that are not broken) or some combination thereof.
<br>
<p>And as has been explained a few times, you can easily embed and do
<br>
everything you want with libev as is, as a lot of work has been invested
<br>
to make it easy. The fact that you disregard this work and make factually
<br>
wrong claims about it will also not have any positive effetc on your
<br>
credibility, of course.
<br>
<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt; and I have cited that it's a common AC/AM/LT model.
</span><br>
<p>Bullshit, embedding other libraries that way is the absolute exception. I
<br>
know of no such library, and I know a lot of libraries. Calling it
<br>
&quot;common&quot; is outright wrong.
<br>
<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt; I've even been polite in the presence of overwhelming hostility.
</span><br>
<p>Thats also not true. Not answerign questions, not reading the documentation
<br>
and making false statements publicly is not polite, it is, in fact, very
<br>
hostile of you and has been noted as such.
<br>
<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt; I freely admitted that I got my first posts all wrong and I totally
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; bozoed by missing the docs.  But somehow, my asking for a feature has
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; resulted in rather fierce attacks.
</span><br>
<p>Thats bullshit, you did not ask for a feature, but you demanded a change
<br>
that would not be a feature, but a bug, as has been explained. Asking for
<br>
the reasons never resulted in anything but claims, never any reasons.
<br>
<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt; I have come to the sad conclusion that your hostility makes further  
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; discussion pointless.
</span><br>
<p>You are insulting me here for no reason. I am not hostile at all. If anybody
<br>
is hostile it is you because you do not want to argue logically or listen to
<br>
advise.
<br>
<p>Your behaviour might indeed make further discussion pointless.
<br>
<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt; FWIW, thanks for the software.  It will probably help us quite a bit.
</span><br>
<p>Good to hear that. If there are problems, feel free to report them. Best send
<br>
somebody else who a) has a basic level of understanding of unix and b)
<br>
doesn't insist on changes just because he wants them without reasoning why.
<br>
You will find that very few maintainers that want to kepe a certain quality
<br>
level in their released packages will give in to gratitious change requests.
