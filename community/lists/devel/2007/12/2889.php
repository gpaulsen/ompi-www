Marc,
<br>
<p>Jeff is one of the most professional individuals, that rationally 
<br>
discusses technical issues and aims to reach a compromises, that I know 
<br>
of.  The Open MPI community relies on him continually to broker solid 
<br>
technical compromises in our community.  So to see such vitriol leads me 
<br>
to believe there must be a lot more context behind this email than is 
<br>
shown below.  
<br>
<p>It is quite obvious from both sides name calling and you feeling 
<br>
compelled to post to this list what seems to like a sound bite at the 
<br>
end of a heated discussion that the two of you (Marc and Jeff) have 
<br>
reached an impasse.  I think both sides need to go to their respective 
<br>
corners, count to ten and then maybe the respective communities should 
<br>
consider trying to have two other people come together to discuss the 
<br>
issues and concerns.

<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I am saddened that you have responded with such ferocity -- calling me

<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a liar and making several other derogatory statements.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; You itself admitted to acting like a dork and an idiot, and unfortunately
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; you didn't stop with your ignorance policy. It is nice and remarkable that
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; you apologised, but that doesn't give you a license to continue trolling.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; If you are saddened, maybe there is a learn-effect to act less like an
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; idiot in the future, but somehow I doubt it from reading this mail.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; You could have easily avoided the ferocity by not using your rethorics
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; (i.e. not being a liar), reading the documentation and listening to the
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; expert willingly explaining all of it.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; The fact that I wasted any time on you by patiently explaining thigs to
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; you again and again makes me not sad, but rather annoyed. People like you
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; are a bad thing for software projects, and I can only hope you either act
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; better when working on openmpi or that openmpi finds a way to route around
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; your damaging behaviour.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Your docs state:
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;    &quot;The goal is to enable you to just copy the neecssary files into your
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;    source directory without having to change even a single line in them,
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;    so you can easily upgrade by simply copying (or having a checked-
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;    out copy of libev somewhere in your source tree).&quot;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; Indeed. And so far, the goal has been met **overwhelmingly well**, **to
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; the letter of the statement** (my emphasis), as *proven* by a number
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; of projects who do *exactly that*. Why you keep spreading fud about it
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; escapes me, but its an extremely unfair and hostile behaviour by you, and
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; something I will certainly not tolerate.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; The reason you keep repeating the opposite or cast doubt on the validity
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; of that statement is the reason for the perceived &quot;ferocity&quot;: you cannot
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; expect that repeating unsound arguments (or worse, spreading FUD) will
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; somehow make somebody else give in (except maybe to stop it by ignoring an
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; idiot).
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; With me, it only has the effect of repeatedly explaining you why it's
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; wrong, each timer longer and with more force, as for some (never stated)
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; reason you never accept those arguments, nor did you ever explain your
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; reasons (or reasoning, if there is any) on why. To me, it decidedly looks
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; as if you only tried to push something into libev that you would like to
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; see, just because you like to see it, wether it makes technical sense or
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; not. You actually stated that a lot in this thread.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; If you find this saddening, maybe you should start listening to what
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; people tell you, instead of dismissing it and dumbly repeating your claims
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; without delivering any evidence.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; But if you keep spreading FUD about libev then you must not be surprised
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; if somebody else reacts accordingly by calling you a liar, because thats
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; what you are, after all.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Having a checked out copy of libev (or, more precisely, an expanded  
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; tarball) is exactly what I want.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; It works for lots of other projects, and it would work for openmpi, as has
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; been explained many times.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; And I wanted to use your Makefile.am.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; And I explained why this is not a good idea (mostly because it doesn't
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; work). The fact that you ignored all that and keep repeating that you wnat
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; to do the wrong thing despite being told repeatedly that it is not the
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; right approach
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I have tried to explain why, I have given code examples,  
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; Thats an outright lie, I asked you many times to explain why, but you
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; never explained it. You repeatedly said &quot;you want this&quot; and &quot;you need
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; this&quot;, but these are not reasons, which you did not deliver. The exampels
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; you gave were either incorrect, didn't solve the problem as claimed, or
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; degraded the quality of the library (by complicating and fixing things
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; that are not broken) or some combination thereof.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; And as has been explained a few times, you can easily embed and do
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; everything you want with libev as is, as a lot of work has been invested
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; to make it easy. The fact that you disregard this work and make factually
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; wrong claims about it will also not have any positive effetc on your
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; credibility, of course.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and I have cited that it's a common AC/AM/LT model.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; Bullshit, embedding other libraries that way is the absolute exception. I
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; know of no such library, and I know a lot of libraries. Calling it
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;common&quot; is outright wrong.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I've even been polite in the presence of overwhelming hostility.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; Thats also not true. Not answerign questions, not reading the documentation
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; and making false statements publicly is not polite, it is, in fact, very
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; hostile of you and has been noted as such.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I freely admitted that I got my first posts all wrong and I totally
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; bozoed by missing the docs.  But somehow, my asking for a feature has
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; resulted in rather fierce attacks.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; Thats bullshit, you did not ask for a feature, but you demanded a change
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; that would not be a feature, but a bug, as has been explained. Asking for
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; the reasons never resulted in anything but claims, never any reasons.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I have come to the sad conclusion that your hostility makes further  
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; discussion pointless.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; You are insulting me here for no reason. I am not hostile at all. If anybody
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; is hostile it is you because you do not want to argue logically or listen to
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; advise.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; Your behaviour might indeed make further discussion pointless.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; FWIW, thanks for the software.  It will probably help us quite a bit.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; Good to hear that. If there are problems, feel free to report them. Best send
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; somebody else who a) has a basic level of understanding of unix and b)
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't insist on changes just because he wants them without reasoning why.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; You will find that very few maintainers that want to kepe a certain quality
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; level in their released packages will give in to gratitious change requests.
