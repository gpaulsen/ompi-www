Hi folks
<br>
<p>Some of you already know this, but I thought I would try to head-off the
<br>
usual rumor mill issues as the word spreads (assuming it will). I am taking
<br>
a break from the Open MPI world for a few months to work on other things. I
<br>
expect to return somewhere in the June time frame, though some uncertainty
<br>
exists regarding the exact timing.
<br>
<p>I'll still monitor the mailing lists, will listen in now and then to the
<br>
weekly telecon, and will try to provide advice upon occasion. From what I've
<br>
seen, the RTE looks pretty stable at this point, so I don't anticipate
<br>
you'll encounter much trouble - let me know if you do.
<br>
<p>I will also continue doing a little work on the OpenRTE area, but that will
<br>
be sporadic (mostly on my own time, though some at work as time permits) and
<br>
will probably mostly deal with backlogged promises and simple experiments
<br>
I've been wanting to do for some time.
<br>
<p>So I am specifically *not* vanishing from the project, dropping off the
<br>
earth, or any of those other draconian things. I simply need to spend some
<br>
neural energy elsewhere for awhile, and that happened to coincide with some
<br>
friends in our senior management needing help with a project.
<br>
<p>Take care
<br>
Ralph
