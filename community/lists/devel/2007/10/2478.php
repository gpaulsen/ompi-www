<p>This is community-based support.  Remember that from our point of  
<br>
view, the community only got the information that it needed to  
<br>
support you on Friday afternoon.  We try very hard to a) put all the  
<br>
information you need to get support on the Open MPI web site (the  
<br>
&quot;getting help&quot; page, the FAQ, the mailing list info pages, etc.), and  
<br>
b) to answer questions as best as we can on the mailing lists.  But  
<br>
the reality is that since this a free support forum, answers  
<br>
sometimes take a little while; it's the best that we can do...
<br>
<p>For faster support, you might want to contact the Open MPI team at  
<br>
LANL...?
