<p>Now wait a minute -- I'm now very confused.  You told me on the phone  
<br>
the other day that for #700, you made a patch that made the RTE be  
<br>
the same between the trunk and v1.2.  Granted, a few things happened  
<br>
on the trunk *after* you made that patch, and a few non-ORTE patches  
<br>
were applied to 1.2 before yours was applied.  But I'm going on what  
<br>
I understood you said in that we effectively *did* take a drop  
<br>
because your patch make ORTE in 1.2 become exactly like the ORTE in  
<br>
the trunk...
