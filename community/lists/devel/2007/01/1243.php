Hi everyone
<br>
<p>Several of us were on a telecon yesterday and the topic of better
<br>
coordinating the activities on OpenRTE came up. While things have percolated
<br>
along reasonably well, the general feeling was that better, wider knowledge
<br>
of current OpenRTE development activities and directions would help -
<br>
especially as more people are becoming involved and/or looking to use
<br>
OpenRTE in different ways.
<br>
<p>Two ideas for responding to that suggestion have been kicked around:
<br>
<p>1. a weekly telecon specifically to discuss OpenRTE development activities,
<br>
directions, and issues. I would appreciate some feedback from people
<br>
interested in participating in such a telecon. If there is sufficient
<br>
interest, I will coordinate a time with the interested people and setup a
<br>
phone bridge.
<br>
<p>2. posted activities (both ongoing and planned) on the OpenRTE web site.
<br>
This could initially just be a posted list (that I would maintain) of what
<br>
people are doing along with a list of &quot;known next steps&quot;. Eventually, this
<br>
could transform into a blog or a wiki, as interests dictate.
<br>
<p>Any feedback on either/both of these ideas would be welcome. I also should
<br>
point out that there is an OpenRTE developers mailing list (see
<br>
<a href="http://www.open-rte.org">http://www.open-rte.org</a>) - it doesn't see a lot of traffic as most of the
<br>
discussion tends to take place on the Open MPI mailing lists (where the
<br>
primary usage currently occurs). However, as interest migrates into other
<br>
applications, I expect to see that activity grow.
<br>
<p>Thanks
<br>
Ralph
