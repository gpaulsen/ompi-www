Cindy indicated she was willing to come in early - she needs about an hour to set things up. 8:30am might be more polite for her, but I suspect she'd be willing to do 8am to accommodate Europe if necessary.<BR>

<PRE><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><I>Ok, since no one made a suggestion yet :-), I nominate the following 
two times:

Wednesday, 27 Jul, 8-11am MT (I think that's 4-7pm DE time, right?)
Thursday, 28 Jul, 8-11am MT

(is that too early for Cindy?  I seem to recall that she has to get in 
early to set things up...?)

I think 6 hours is probably enough for this one meeting.  Please 
propose alternate times by COB today so that we can have an upper bound 
on time-for-consensus.

Three remote sites so far:

- UTK
- ? for Torsten
- Stuttgart

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I ask because those of us involved in that meeting will need to 
&gt;&gt; reserve
&gt;&gt; time on the Access Grid and coordinate with the remote sites for
&gt;&gt; participation.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; AFAIK, we have 2 remote sites, right?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; - UTK, for Graham Fagg (and others?)
&gt;&gt; - ?? for Torsten (Torsten: you mentioned where before, but I don't
&gt;&gt; recall the name of the site)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Are there others?
