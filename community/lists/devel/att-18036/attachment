<div dir="ltr">Gilles,<div><br></div><div>Your commit 6e6a3e96 is only partially correct. There is no point arguing about the correctness of the const keyword for the send buffer. I can also understand your willingness to diverge from the MPI standard in order to fix the interface for irecv_init. But there is definitively no reason to have const for:</div><div>- the receive buffer of any receive functions</div><div>- the free buffer (mca_allocator_*_free)</div><div><br></div><div>Please revise you patch.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks,</div><div>  George.</div><div><br></div></div>
