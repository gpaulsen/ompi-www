This might not be an issue (or a big one), but I have some code I am<BR>
working on that replaces memcpy with an opal memcpy routine. Does your<BR>
change below remove the ability of the BTLs to call opal routines?<BR>

&gt; Now that 1.3 will be released, we would like to go ahead with the plan<BR>
&gt; to move the btl&#8217;s out of the MPI layer. Greg Koenig who is doing most<BR>
&gt; of the work has started a wiki page with details on the plans. Right<BR>
&gt; now details are sketchy, as Greg is digging through the code, and has<BR>
&gt; only hand written notes on data structures that need to be moved,<BR>
&gt; include files that are not needed, etc. The page is at:<BR>
&gt; _<a href="https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/wiki/BTLExtraction_">https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/wiki/BTLExtraction_</a><BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; The first three steps basically only involve code motion, moving items<BR>
&gt; such as ompi_list, and renaming them, moving where the code is<BR>
&gt; actually located in the repository, and the like. For these we do not<BR>
&gt; plan to put out a formal RFC, but comments are very welcome, and any<BR>
&gt; hands that are willing to help with this are even more welcome.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; The last phase where the btl&#8217;s are made dependent on OPAL, and<BR>
&gt; supporting libraries such as mpools I expect will be disruptive, and<BR>
&gt; will definitely require an RFC, and will also be a longer process.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Please send comments,<BR>
