<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Hi Everyone, 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I wanted to ask some questions about things I am having trouble understanding. 
</p>

<ol><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">As far as my understanding of
	MPI_INIT function, I assumed MPI_INIT typically procedure resources
	required including the sockets. But now as I understand from the
	documentation that openMPI only allocated socket when the process
	has to send a message to a peer. If some one could let me where
	exactly in the code this is happening I would appreciate a lot. I
	guess this is happening in ORTE layer so I am spending time looking
	at it. But if some one could let me in which function this is
	happening it will help me a lot. <br></p>
	</li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Also I think most of the MPI
	implementation embed source and destination address with the communication
	protocol. Am I right to assume openMPI does the same thing. Is this also happening in the ORTE layer.<br></p></li></ol>Is there a documentation about this openMPI site? if there can someone please let me know the location of it.<br><br>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Sincerely,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Leo.P
