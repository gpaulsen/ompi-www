      that will remove the false positive, but also remove an important
      piece of information :<br>
      there is something wrong with the master.<br>
      <br>
      would you mind discussion this on the weekly call ?<br>
      <br>
      Cheers,<br>

      <pre wrap="">how about if I will disable the failing test(s) and make jenkins to pass?
It will help us to make sure we don`t break something that did work before?

Jenkins runs automated tests on each pull request, and i think this is a
good thing.

recently, it reported a bunch of failure but i could not find anything
to blame in the PR itself.

so i created a dummy PR <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/pull/264">https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/pull/264</a> with
git commit --allow-empty
and waited for Jenkins to do its job.

the test failed, which means there is an issue in the master.
from the master point of view, it is good to know there is an issue.
from the PR point of view, this is a false positive since the PR does
nothing wrong.

i was unable to find anything on github that indicates the master does
not pass the automated tests.
is such automated test running vs the master ? if yes, where can we find
the results ?
in order to avoid dealing with false positive, is there any possibility
to disable automated tests on the PR
if the master does not pass the tests ?

Cheers,

Gilles
