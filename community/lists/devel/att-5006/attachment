<FONT FACE="Calibri, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><SPAN STYLE='font-size:11pt'>How about if we start on this over e-mail and phone ? &nbsp;A face-to-face meeting is good, but I am already booked Jan 5-9, maybe 12-13, Jan 16-Feb 6th, and Feb 8-11. &nbsp;I would prefer not to tack on something at the end of the MPI Forum meeting, as I will have been gone from home for most of the month before. &nbsp;If people would be willing to do this at ORNL, I would be available Jan 14-15, and after Feb 11th.<BR>

So I would ask we not have the Jan/Feb ORTE meeting either<BR>
of those weeks.<BR>

&gt;&gt; I don't know who's interested, so I thought I'd bring it up on the devel<BR>
&gt;&gt; list: let's start the basics for the January ORTE meeting. &nbsp;We may be able<BR>
&gt;&gt; to sketch out an agenda, but frankly, it may depend on how far we get in the<BR>
&gt;&gt; December meeting. &nbsp;So we may not be able to fully decide that yet.<BR>
&gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt; But I thought we might be able to list out the high level goals and start<BR>
&gt;&gt; discussing location, length of the meeting, and dates.<BR>
&gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt; * Cisco has some heavy travel restrictions right now, so I would not be<BR>
&gt;&gt; able to attend unless we have it here in Louisville again, or perhaps<BR>
&gt;&gt; Bloomington (i.e., I can make day trips to drive there). &nbsp;I do have a<BR>
&gt;&gt; Telepresence unit in Louisville now, so we could conference in Boxborough<BR>
&gt;&gt; (i.e., Sun) for 1-2 hours at a time, if desirable. &nbsp;That being said, my<BR>
&gt;&gt; presence is probably not critical to these meetings, so don't let this be a<BR>
&gt;&gt; gating factor.<BR>
&gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt; * My January is fairly open at this point; I have no scheduled travel<BR>
&gt;&gt; [yet]. &nbsp;I *may* become unavailable the week of Jan 5 (i.e., first full week<BR>
&gt;&gt; in Jan), which might not be desirable for an ORTE meeting anyway because a)<BR>
&gt;&gt; we'll all be recovering from the holidays, and b) it's unlikely that anyone<BR>
&gt;&gt; will have had a chance to do much/anything since the December ORTE meeting.<BR>
&gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt; * Point of information: the next Forum meeting is in the California Bay<BR>
&gt;&gt; area on Feb 9-11, 2009.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; My Jan is open, and I can travel wherever required. However, given that many<BR>
&gt; people are under heavy travel constraints, and that the majority of you will<BR>
&gt; be at the MPI Forum, would it make sense to tack it on before/after that<BR>
&gt; meeting? I'm not sure Jan is a requirement, especially given the holiday<BR>
&gt; break after the Dec meeting.<BR>
