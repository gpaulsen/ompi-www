<br>
<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">Now that you mention it, I believe you
are right. In fact, I did not know that I needed to set the req_status.MPI_ERROR
in my MTL. I looked at the mx mtl and realized that req_status.MPI_ERROR
is getting set in their progress function. So, in general, when do you
set the req_status.MPI_ERROR? After a send/recv has completed successfully?

&gt; Hi,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I was issuing an MPI_Bcast in a sample program and was hitting an
&nbsp;<br>
&gt; unknown error; at least that was what MPI was telling me. I traced
&nbsp;<br>
&gt; through the code to find my error and came upon &nbsp;<br>
&gt; MCA_PML_CM_REQUEST_INIT_COMMON macro function in pml_cm_sendreq.h.
&nbsp;<br>
&gt; I looked at the function and noticed that in this function the &nbsp;<br>
&gt; elements of req_status were getting initialized; however, &nbsp;<br>
&gt; req_status.MPI_ERROR was not. I thought that maybe MPI_ERROR must
&nbsp;<br>
&gt; also require initialization because if the value of MPI_ERROR was
&nbsp;<br>
&gt; some arbitrary value not equal to MPI_SUCCESS then my program will
&nbsp;<br>
&gt; definitely die. Unless, MPI_ERROR is propragating from upper layers
&nbsp;<br>
&gt; to signify an error, but I wasn't sure. Anyway, I assumed that &nbsp;<br>
&gt; MPI_ERROR was not propagating from upper layers, so then I set &nbsp;<br>
&gt; req_status.MPI_ERROR to MPI_SUCCUSS and reran my test program. My
&nbsp;<br>
&gt; program worked. Now, having gotten my program to work, I thought I
&nbsp;<br>
&gt; should run this by you to make sure that MPI_ERROR was not &nbsp;<br>
&gt; propagating from upper layers. Is it ok that I did a:<br>
&gt; &quot;(req_send)-&gt;req_base.req_ompi.req_status.MPI_ERROR = MPI_SUCCESS;&quot;
&nbsp;<br>
&gt; in MCA_PML_CM_REQUEST_INIT_COMMON?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Thank You,<br>
