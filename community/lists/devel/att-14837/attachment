<div dir="ltr">Hi,<div>Is my understanding correct?<br><div>While servicing MPI_Send Â using eager protocol over openib, there is a data-size threshold below which it is preferred to copy the contents of the user-buffer to a pre-pinned buffer instead of directly pinning down the user-buffer. If this is correct, how does one determine this threshold?</div>
