&gt; There are many differences between the trunk and 1.8 regarding the TCP BTL. The major I remember about is that the TCP in the trunk is reporting errors to the upper level via the callbacks attached to fragments, while the 1.8 TCP BTL doesn&#39;t.<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; So, I guess that once a connection to a particular endpoint fails, the trunk is getting the errors reported via the cb and then takes some drastic measure. In the 1.8 we might fallback and try another IP address before giving up.<br>

<br>
</div>Does that has any effect on performance?<br>
<br>
I.e., should we bring this change to v1.8?<br>
<br>
Or, put simply: which way is Right?<br>
