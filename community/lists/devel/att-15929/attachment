      why not just make the topology information available at that point
      as you described it ?<br>
      <br>
      the attached patch does this, could you please review it ?<br>
      <br>
      Cheers,<br>

        <pre wrap="">I finally managed to track down some issues in mpi4py's test suite
using Open MPI 1.8+. The code below should be enough to reproduce the
problem. Run it under valgrind to make sense of my following
diagnostics.

In this code I'm creating a 2D, periodic Cartesian topology out of
COMM_SELF. In this case, the process in COMM_SELF has 4 logical in/out
links to itself. So we have size=1 but indegree=outdegree=4. However,
in ompi/mca/coll/basic/coll_basic_module.c, "size * 2" request are
being allocated to manage communication:

    if (OMPI_COMM_IS_INTER(comm)) {
        size = ompi_comm_remote_size(comm);
    } else {
        size = ompi_comm_size(comm);
    }
    basic_module-&gt;mccb_num_reqs = size * 2;
    basic_module-&gt;mccb_reqs = (ompi_request_t**)
        malloc(sizeof(ompi_request_t *) * basic_module-&gt;mccb_num_reqs);

I guess you have to also special-case for topologies and allocate
indegree+outdegree requests (not sure about this number, just
guessing).

I wish this was possible but the topology information is not available
at that point. We may be able to change that but I don't see the work
completing anytime soon. I committed an alternative fix as r32796 and
CMR'd it to 1.8.3. I can confirm that the attached reproducer no longer
produces a SEGV. Let me know if you run into any more issues.
