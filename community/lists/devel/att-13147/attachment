Ralph and I talked today about the logistics of bringing the OpenSHMEM<br>
code to the 1.7 release branch, as it&#39;s now a fairly large set of changes<br>
from the trunk.  What we propose is to follow the same proceedure we used<br>
when merging in the RTE framework change, which is essentially a staging<br>
branch.  So, Mellanox (as the one filing the CMR) would branch from 1.7,<br>
bring the OpenSHMEM changes into that (and hopefully test), and then file<br>
a single CMR for the changes from the branch.  If done properly, the GK<br>
then only has to merge with --reintegrate and we&#39;re set.<br>
<br>
Let&#39;s talk about it on the call tomorrow, but that&#39;s the current proposal.<br>
