The question about the unexpected queue was to check and see if proper MPI matching is done. &nbsp;If there is matching entry in the unexpected queue, this is the one that is the correct match from the MPI matching rules.<BR>

Within the specific code I've put back so far, I happen to check the unexpected list. &nbsp;If it has something on it, the &quot;immediate&quot; receive reverts to the traditional code path. &nbsp;If the unexpected list is empty, I proceed on to the FIFO. &nbsp;Again, that's just how the code works that I've put back so far to the workspace mentioned in the RFC.<BR>
<BR>
You can let me know why you ask and what behavior you recommend.<BR>
<BR>
Again, to be quite honest, a lot of my interest here is motivated by (ping-pong style) benchmarks. &nbsp;I feel dirty just admitting that, but then I remind myself of all the reports I see of people getting really bad latencies using OMPI.<BR>
