<P><FONT SIZE=2>I thought about both of those (/tmp/private and /tmp/public), but couldn't think of a way to make them work.<BR>
<BR>
1. If we do /tmp/private, we have to svn mv all the existing trees there which will annoy the developers (but is not a deal-breaker) and make /tmp publicly readable.&nbsp; But that makes the history of all the private branches public.<BR>
<BR>
2. If we do /tmp/public, I'm not quite sure how to setup the perms in SH to do that - if we setup /tmp to be 'no read access' for * and /tmp/public to have 'read access' for *, will a non authenticated user be able to reach /tmp/private?<BR>

ugh, sorry, I've been busy this week and didn't see a timeout, so a&nbsp;<BR>
response got delayed.<BR>
<BR>
I really don't like this format.&nbsp; public doesn't have any meaning to&nbsp;<BR>
it (tmp suggests, well, it's temporary).&nbsp; I'd rather have /tmp/ and /<BR>
tmp/private or something like that.&nbsp; Or /tmp/ and /tmp/public/.&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
Either way :/.<BR>

&gt; Developers should feel free to use this tree for public temporary<BR>
&gt; branches.&nbsp; Specifically:<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; - use /tmp if your branch is intended to be private<BR>
&gt; - use /public if your branch is intended to be public<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Enjoy.<BR>

&gt;&gt; Right now all branches under /tmp are private to the OMPI core group<BR>
&gt;&gt; (e.g., to allow unpublished academic work).&nbsp; However, there are<BR>
&gt;&gt; definitely cases where it would be useful to allow public branches<BR>
&gt;&gt; when there's development work that is public but not yet ready for<BR>
&gt;&gt; the trunk.&nbsp; Periodically, we go an assign individual permissions to /<BR>
&gt;&gt; tmp branches (like I just did to /tmp/vt-integration), but it would<BR>
&gt;&gt; be easier if we had a separate tree for public &quot;tmp&quot; branches.<BR>
&gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt; Would anyone have an objection if I added /public (or any better name<BR>
&gt;&gt; that someone can think of) for tmp-style branches, but that are open<BR>
&gt;&gt; for read-only access to the public?<BR>
