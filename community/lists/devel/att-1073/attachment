The ompi_info command shows the following description for &quot;btl_openib_max_btls&quot; parameter<br>MCA btl: parameter &quot;btl_openib_max_btls&quot; (current value: &quot;-1&quot;)&nbsp; Maximum number of HCA ports to use (-1 = use all available, otherwise must be &gt;= 1)
<br><br>Even though I specify &quot;mpirun --mca btl_openib_max_btls 1 .....&quot;&nbsp; 2 openib btls are created(the HCA has 2 ports). <br>When I try to run Open MPI across 2 nodes (one node has an HCA with 2 ports and the other has only one port). Both endpoints send the QP information over to the peer. Only one endpoint exists at the peer so it prints the following error message:
<br>[0,1,1][btl_openib_endpoint.c:706:mca_btl_openib_endpoint_recv] can't find suitable endpoint for this peer<br><br>[0,1,0][btl_openib_endpoint.c:913:mca_btl_openib_endpoint_connect] error posting receive errno says Operation now in progress
<br><br>[0,1,0][btl_openib_endpoint.c:737:mca_btl_openib_endpoint_recv] endpoint connect error: -1<br><br>Is &quot;btl_openib_max_btls&quot; the maximum number of BTLs or maximum number of BTLs per port (which is what the current implementation &quot;init_one_hca()&quot; looks like)?
