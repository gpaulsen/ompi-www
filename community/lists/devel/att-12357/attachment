    Yes, on Linux, you will see something like this in lstopo v1.7:<br>
    <pre>  HostBridge L#0
    PCIBridge
      PCI 8086:225c
        CoProc L#2 "mic0"

</pre>
    And these contain some attributes saying how many cores and how much
    memory there is in the Phi.<br>
    <br>
    lstopo from the host doesn't currently create cache/core/thread
    objects inside the Phi but you can also run lstopo inside the Phi if
    needed.<br>
