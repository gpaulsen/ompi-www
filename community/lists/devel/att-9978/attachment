Hello @ll.<br><br>I&#39;m doing some changes in the communication framework. Right now i&#39;m working on a &quot;secure&quot; MPI_Send, this send needs to know when an endpoint goes down, and then retry the communication constructing a new endpoint, or at least, overwriting the data of the old endpoint with the new address of the receiver process. Overwriting the data of the endpoint is not a problem anymore, because i&#39;ve done that before.<br>
<br>For example, if we consider a Master/Worker application, where the master sends data to the workers, and  workers start the computation, then, the master posts a send to the worker1 that fails and get restarted in another node and in his new location the worker1 posts the recv to the master&#39;s send. The problem here is that the master post the send when the process was residing in one node, but the process expects the message in another node. I need the sender to realize that the process is now in another node, and retries the communication with a modificated endpoint. Anyone could please tell me where in the send code i can obtain the status of a message that hasn&#39;t been send and resend it to a new location. Also i want to know, where can i obtain information about an endpoint fail?.<br>
<br>Thanks in advance.<br><br>Hugo<br>
