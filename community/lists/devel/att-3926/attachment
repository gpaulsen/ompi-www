&gt; What are the meanings of the PML names OB1, DR and CM? The paper &quot;An<br>
&gt; evaluation of Open MPI&#39;s Matching Transport Layer on the Cray XT&quot;<br>
&gt; says that they don&#39;t have any special meaning, but here (<a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/papers/workshop-2006/wed_01_pt2pt.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.open-mpi.org/papers/workshop-2006/wed_01_pt2pt.pdf</a><br>


&gt; ) I saw that DR stands for &quot;Data Reliability&quot;. It&#39;s correct?<br>

You are correct about &quot;DR&quot; -- but note that it was never finished.<br>
It&#39;s probably only pseudo-operable; it doesn&#39;t do everything that it<br>
was designed to do because the DR developers got other priorities and<br>
never finished it.<br>
<br>
OB1 = Obi-Wan Kenobi from Star Wars (we couldn&#39;t think of any good<br>
name at the time and really needed a name so that we could start<br>
coding...)<br>
 &nbsp;--&gt; similarly, the &quot;r2&quot; BML is R2-D2 from Star Wars<br>
<br>
CM = &quot;Connor MacLeod&quot; from The Highlander movie, a reference to the<br>
fact that &quot;there can only be 1&quot; ...MTL module in an MPI process (vs.<br>
OB1, which can have as many BTL modules as are relevant)<br>
<br>
There you go -- a little insight into the warped minds of those of us<br>
who bring you Open MPI. &nbsp;Ok, I&#39;m a little embarrassed now. &nbsp;;-)<br>
