      the root cause -D_REENTRANT is not set automatically is we test
      the<br>
      __sun__ macro and 12.4 compiler defines only __sun and sun<br>

I looked again carefully and I am *NOT* finding -D_REENTRANT passed to most
compilations.
It appears to be used for building libevent and vt, but nothing else.
The output from configure contains

checking if more special flags are required for pthreads... -D_REENTRANT

only in the libevent and vt sub-configure portions.

When configured for gcc on Solaris-11 I see the following in configure

checking for C optimization flags... -m64 -D_REENTRANT -g
-finline-functions -fno-strict-aliasing

but with CC=cc the equivalent line is

checking for C optimization flags... -m64 -g

In both cases the "-m64" is from the CFLAGS I have passed to configure.

However, when I use CFLAGS="-m64 -D_REENTRANT" the problem DOES NOT go away.
I see

[pcp-j-20:24740] mca_oob_tcp_accept: accept() failed: Error 0 (11).

which is at least appears to have a non-zero errno.
A quick grep through /usr/include/sys/errno shows 11 is EAGAIN.

With the oob.patch you provided the failed accept goes away, BUT the
connection still fails:

Use of "-mca oob_tcp_if_include bge0" to use a single interface did not fix
this.

Gilles,

I am NOT seeing the problem with gcc.
It is only occurring with the Studio compilers.

As I've already reported, I have tried adding either "-mt" or "-mt=yes" to
both LDFLAGS and --with-wrapper-ldflags.

The "cc" manpage (on the Solaris-10 system I can get to right now) says:

     -mt  Compile and link for multithreaded code.

          This option passes -D_REENTRANT to the preprocessor and
          passes -lthread in the correct order to ld.

          The -mt option is required if the application or
          libraries are multithreaded.

          To ensure proper library linking order, you must use
          this option, rather than -lthread, to link with lib-
          thread.

          If you are using POSIX threads, you must link with the
          options -mt -lpthread.  The -mt option is necessary
          because libC and libCrun need libthread for a mul-
          tithreaded application.

          If you compile and link in separate steps and you com-
          pile with -mt, you might get unexpected results. If you
          compile one translation unit with -mt, compile all
          units of the program with -mt.

I cannot connect to my Solaris-11 system right now, but I recall the text
to be quite similar.

did you manually set -mt ?

if i remember correctly, solaris 11 (at least with gcc compilers) do not
need any flags
(except the -D_REENTRANT that is added automatically)

Cheers,

Gilles,

I will try the patch when I can.
However, our network is undergoing network maintenance right now, leaving
me unable to reach the necessary hosts.

As for -D_REENTRANT, I had already reported having verified in the "make"
output that it had been added automatically.

Additionally, the docs say that "-mt" *also* passes -D_REENTRANT to the
preprocessor.

 Paul,

could you please make sure configure added  "-D_REENTRANT" to the CFLAGS ?
/* otherwise, errno is a global variable instead of a per thread variable,
which can

assuming -D_REENTRANT is set, could you please give the attached patch a
try ?

i suspect the CLOSE_THE_SOCKET macro resets errno, and hence the confusing
error message
e.g. failed: Error 0 (0)

FWIW, master is also affected.

Cheers,

Even with just one interface and -mt=yes in both LDFLAGS and

I am getting less certain that my speculation about thread-safe libs is
correct.

 A little more reading finds that...

Docs says that one needs "-mt" without the "=yes".
That will work for both old and new compilers, where "-mt=yes" chokes
older ones.

Also, man pages say "-mt" must come before "-lpthread" in the link command.

 7. Linkage issue on Solaris-11 reported by Paul Hargrove. Missing the
multi-threaded C libraries, apparently need "-mt=yes" in both compile and
link. Need someone to investigate.


The lack of multi-thread libraries is my SPECULATION.

The fact that configuring with LDFLAGS=-mt=yes did not help may or may
not prove anything.
I didn't see them in "mpicc -show" and so maybe they needed to be in
wrapper-ldflags instead.
My time this week is quite limited, but I can "fire an forget" tests of
any tarballs you provide.
