&gt; If I understand one is (or will be soon) expected to have libtool-dev(el) installed on the build system, even if one is not a OMPI developer.<br>
<br>
</span>No.  We don&#39;t want to raise the bar that high for simple user installations.<br>
<br>
If you are installing an OMPI tarball from source (that is not a git clone):<br>
<br>
1. If you have libltdl devel support installed (i.e., ltdl.h), then OMPI will build as it always has: with plugin support.<br>
<br>
2. If you do not have libltdl devel support installed, then OMPI will effectively behave as if --disable-dlopen was specified.  I.e., there will be no plugin support and all OMPI plugins will be slurped up into their upper-level libraries (e.g., BTLs are slurped up into libmpi.so or libmpi.a).<br>
<br>
Hence, from OMPI tarballs, *OMPI will always build and function correctly* -- regardless of whether you have libltdl / libltdl-devel.<br>
<br>
I&#39;m guessing that many user installations will now build without plugin support (because libltdl-devel is typically not installed in Linux distros / OS X by default).  However, after talking this through in Dallas this week, I&#39;m not thinking that this is a problem.<br>
<span class=""><br>
&gt; How does this plan to cease embedding libltdl align with the fact that <a href="http://autogen.pl" target="_blank">autogen.pl</a> currently applies patches to the parts of the generated configure from the *packager&#39;s* system?  Isn&#39;t there now going to be a disconnect between the versions of libtool-related portions of the configure script shipped in a tarball and the version (if any) of libltdl on the system building from that tarball?<br>
<br>
</span>I think that&#39;s two questions:<br>
<br>
1. Will OMPI continue to patch configure/etc. w.r.t. libltdl functionality?<br>
<br>
No; there&#39;s no need, because we were effectively patching against the embedded libltdl.  Since we&#39;re not embedding, there&#39;s nothing to patch.<br>
<br>
We will lose the &quot;bug fix&quot; that we were patching, however (there is a giant comment in this file that explains what it is for): <a href="https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/blob/master/config/libltdl-preopen-error.diff" target="_blank">https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/blob/master/config/libltdl-preopen-error.diff</a><br>
<br>
That may be a bit annoying.  ...but then again, if most users are going to end up not building plugin support, the need for that patch effectively goes away.<br>
<br>
2. What happens if OMPI tries to build against an old libltdl?<br>
<br>
We *should* be ok.  libltdl has been stable for a long time.  libltdl added the lt_dladvise functionality at one point, but we added configure tests to check for that a long time ago (i.e., the C code can handle whether or not your libltdl has support for lt_dladvise).<br>
<br>
This PR actually adds the results of those lt_dladvise configury tests to ompi_info output.<br>
<span class=""><br>
&gt; Also, I can still build v1.8 on an old Red Hat 8 system where the system libtool/libltdl is 1.4.2, perhaps only because Open MPI embeds a recent version.<br>
<br>
</span>Could be.  Would you mind testing the OMPI PR branch on this old system?  I can make you a tarball if it would help.<br>
<span class=""><br>
&gt; What minimum version of libltdl is required after the proposed change?<br>
&gt; Will I need to install a libtool-2.x on that old system to be able to build OpenMPI with dlopen support?<br>
<br>
</span>I don&#39;t know what the minimum Libtool/libltdl required version is; I didn&#39;t try to back track to find it.<br>
<br>
I think that if we can still build on a sufficiently-old system (e.g., Red Hat 8 with your LT 1.4.2), that is probably good enough.<br>
<br>
Also, remember: libltdl has *never been required* for Open MPI.  Although building with libltdl has always been the default, you could always have disabled it.  This PR effectively now changes the default to build-it-if-we-got-it-and-skip-it-if-we-don&#39;t for users, and developers must specify --disable-dlopen if they don&#39;t have libltdl-devel (per the assumption that most developers will want to build with dlopen support).<br>
