I think you are misunderstanding what I'm saying. I'm not heavily against it, but I still don't see the value, and dislike making disruptive changes that span the code base without first ensuring there is no other viable alternative.<div><br></div><div>FWIW: Most libraries remain ABI compliant across major releases for exactly the reasons you cite. We don't actually support building against one library version and running against another for these very reasons - if users do that, it is at their own risk. Your change won't resolve that problem as ompi_info is just as likely to barf when confronted by that situation - remember, in order to register the component, ompi_info has to *load* it first. So any library incompatibility may well have already caused a problem.</div><div><br></div><div><br><div><div>On Apr 14, 2014, at 7:59 AM, Mike Dubman &lt;<a href="mailto:miked@dev.mellanox.co.il">miked@dev.mellanox.co.il</a>&gt; wrote:</div><br class="Apple-interchange-newline"><blockquote type="cite"><div dir="ltr">There is no correlation between built_with and running_with versions of external libraries supported by OMPI.<div><br></div><div>The next release of external library does not mean we should remove code in ompi for all previous supported releases for the same library.</div>

Not true - we do indeed check the library version in all cases where it matters. For example, the case you cite as your true story could easily have been prevented by using OMPI_CHECK_PACKAGE to verify that the libmxm had the required function in it</div>

I'm still confused - how is that helpful? How was the build allowed to complete if the external library version isn't supported?? You should either quietly not-build the affected component, or error out if the user specifically requested that component be built.</div>

<div><br></div><div>This sounds to me like you have a weakness in your configure logic, and are trying to find a bandaid. Perhaps a better solution (that wouldn't cause us to change every component in the code base) would be to just add appropriate tests to your configure logic so you don't incorrectly build against an unsupported library?</div>

<br></div><div>* If we are building against an unsupported version of an external library, that is supposed to be detected by the configure logic, yes? &nbsp;So you would output a nice error message at that time, and stop the build process.</div>


<div><br></div><div>* If we were built against one version of an external library, and someone attempts to run us against a different version, you'd have to detect that somehow at runtime. I'm not sure how you could reliably do that as the problem is likely to manifest itself as an unresolved function (i.e., we use something that doesn't exist in the version being used) or a difference in a function signature. Either way, you'll either fail to load the library or crash.</div>


<div><br></div><div>So I'm not sure what the added function pointer actually accomplishes. I suppose you could use it during ompi_info to display something about what version you linked against, but that won't help solve either of the above problems.</div>
