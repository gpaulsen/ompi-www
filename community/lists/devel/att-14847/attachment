<div dir="ltr"><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div>Folks,<br><br></div>currently, the dynamic/intercomm_create test from the ibm test suite output the following messages :<br><br>dpm_base_disconnect_init: error -12 in isend to process 1<br>
<br></div>the root cause it task 0 tries to send messages to already exited tasks.<br><br></div>one way of seeing things is that this is an application issue :<br>task 0 should have MPI_Comm_free&#39;d all its communicator before calling MPI_Comm_disconnect.<br>
This can be achieved via the attached patch<br><br></div>an other way of seeing things is that this is a bug in OpenMPI.<br></div>In this case, what would be the the right approach ?<br></div>- automatically free communicators (if needed) when MPI_Comm_disconnect is invoked ?<br>
</div>- simply remove communicators (if needed) from ompi_mpi_communicators when MPI_Comm_disconnect is invoked ?<br></div>Â  /* this causes a memory leak, but the application can be seen as responsible of it */<br></div>- other ?<br>
<br></div>Thanks in advance for your feedback,<br><br>Gilles<br></div>
