Point well made, Nick. In other words, irrespective of OS or language, are we citing the need for &quot;application correcting code&quot; from OpenMPI, (relocate a/o retry) similar to ECC in memory? <BR>

&gt;&gt; I think that sums it up pretty well.  :-)
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; It does seem a little strange that the scenario you describe somewhat 
&gt;&gt; implies that one process is calling MPI_Finalize loooong before the 
&gt;&gt; others do. Specifically, the user is concerned with tying up resources 
&gt;&gt; after one process has called Finalize -- which implies that the others 
&gt;&gt; may continue on for a while. It's not invalid, of course, but it is a 
&gt;&gt; little unusual.
&gt;
&gt; I'm finding it more common than we thought. Note that I didn't say that 
&gt; one process called MPI_Finalize before the others. In this case, they 
&gt; call it fairly close together, but the individual processes continue 
&gt; running for quite some time, or until they determine that something is 
&gt; wrong and exit with non-zero status.

Nobody is denying that it is common.  Now, what happens when you encounter
a language or compiler that uses return codes for mere warnings (e.g.
ignored IEEE 754 flags, as stated to be desirable by LIA-1)?  Bang!

Remember that C is not the universe and many languages use MPI via the
C interface, but do not let C control their model.
