Hi Jeff,<br>Thank you for your prompt response.  I have a query related to MPI_INIT here.  What is the underlying transport mechanism does OpenMPI uses to exchange service-id/lid via MPI_INIT, is it TCP/IP socket ?<br><br>
Thanks &amp; Regards,<br>Ramu<br><br><div class="gmail_quote"><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); padding-left: 1ex;">

&gt; I am trying to explore the details of connection establishment in OpenMPI using libibcm/librdmacm.<br>
<br>
Note that the IB community has given up on ibcm.  Our support of it is incomplete; I wouldn&#39;t look at it as an example.<br>
<br>
&gt; In the code, I could not find how OpenMPI app is getting service-id/lid of remote node to which it wants to connect.<br>
<br>
In the normal case, we pass that information during MPI_INIT.  It&#39;s a global gather / broadcast operation that we refer to as the &quot;modex&quot; (module exchange).  I.e., each openib BTL module instance publishes its address information in the modex and sends it.  Near the end of MPI_INIT, each MPI process receives the modex broadcast and caches it.<br>

<br>
During connection establishment, an MPI process will look in its modex cache to find the connection information for the peer process that it wants to connect to.<br>
<br>
&gt; Also, I did not see any query in the code related to service_record_get from SA.  Can you please desribe what is happening OR Am I missing something here ?<br>
<br>
IIRC, we don&#39;t currently use the SA because of its serialization and other resource bottlenecks (this is a hand-waving answer; I don&#39;t remember the exact reasons for not using the SA, but there were many discussions between the MPI and OpenFabrics communities a long time ago.  The SA issues were not resolved to the MPI community&#39;s liking, IIRC, but this was a long time ago, and I don&#39;t even work for an IB vendor any more, so I might not be remembering this correctly...).<br>
