<BR>
After talking with Jeff I withdraw my request to change the approach. &nbsp;This is a good approach when one wants to send warnings to some sort of logging system, in addition to errors. &nbsp;Sending the data up stream like I suggested can&#8217;t rely on the error return-code, and as such requires a check on every return &#8211; bad idea.<BR>
<BR>
If the call is for a discussion beyond this, this is fine with me, but would be more useful once a concrete idea on how to implement step 4 is reached. &nbsp;If people have specific ideas, an early call would be good, otherwise I would expect that early Jan we would be better prepared to talk about specifics.<BR>
<BR>
The copy and branch approach is not practical &#8211; it doubles the maintenance work, and the point is to leverage on-going work.<BR>

How about a teleconf to discuss the following about the notifier:<BR>
<BR>
- what exactly is there today<BR>
- why what is there today is the way it is<BR>
- discuss proposals on different ways to do it<BR>
<BR>
More specifically, I think we all agree that the idea of an MPI <BR>
application notifying a higher-level entity when it detects errors is <BR>
a good one (e.g., on the host, or in the network, or ...). &nbsp;I think <BR>
that it is worth discussing in higher bandwidth so that we can avoid <BR>
email hell (I agree with Ralph; this could devolve pretty easily).<BR>
<BR>
I propose any of the following times to discuss (I'll setup a phone <BR>
bridge):<BR>
<BR>
- Mon, Dec 8, 2pm, 3pm, or 4pm Eastern<BR>
- Tue, Dec 9, 10am, noon, 1pm, 2pm, 3pm, or 4pm Eastern<BR>
- Wed, Dec 10, any time<BR>
- Thu, Dec 11, 11am, 1pm, 2pm, 3pm, or 4pm Eastern<BR>
- Fri, Dec 12, 9am, 10am, 11am, 2pm, 3pm, or 4pm Eastern<BR>

&gt; I'm beginning to believe that we need a design meeting specifically <BR>
&gt; over this question. Too many unknowns exist, with significant <BR>
&gt; potential problems lurking behind them. Frankly, this issue could <BR>
&gt; have a major impact on how we operate, performance, and a variety of <BR>
&gt; other factors going forward - many of which may be difficult to <BR>
&gt; predict.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; I suspect there may not be &quot;optimal&quot; solutions to many of these <BR>
&gt; questions, but there certainly will be strong opinions in multiple <BR>
&gt; directions.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; As part of that discussion, I propose that we consider alternative <BR>
&gt; methods for meeting the same overall objective - namely, reuse of <BR>
&gt; the BTL's by another software project. For example, a simple copy-<BR>
&gt; and-branch is the dominant method today, with patches used by both <BR>
&gt; parties to cherry-pick the changes they want from the other code <BR>
&gt; users. Multiple tools have been developed to support this mode of <BR>
&gt; operation, yet we haven't discussed any of them in this context. The <BR>
&gt; proposed approach contains a number of impacts that may be avoided <BR>
&gt; with an alternative approach.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Without such a meeting, I fear we are going to rapidly dissolve into <BR>
&gt; email hell again.<BR>

&gt;&gt;&gt; I expect this will involve some sort of well defined interface <BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt; between the btl&#8217;s and orte, and I don&#8217;t know if this will also <BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt; require something like this between the btl&#8217;s and the pml &#8211; I <BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt; think that interface is rigidly enforced, but am not sure.<BR>
&gt;&gt; I'm probably missing the scope of what you're saying here, but it <BR>
&gt;&gt; raises another question in my mind. &nbsp;Is there today a well-defined <BR>
&gt;&gt; interface between the BTLs and... anything else? &nbsp;PML or whatever? &nbsp;<BR>
&gt;&gt; Maybe this comes back to a documentation question: &nbsp;do we (or will <BR>
&gt;&gt; we) have anything written down that says what a BTL must do, what <BR>
&gt;&gt; it may rely on, etc.?<BR>
