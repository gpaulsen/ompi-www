<div><br></div><div>For the user building&nbsp;sources&nbsp;via RPM or APT packaging for Linux, Fink for MacOS, or ports/packages for BSDs there are already mechanisms for expressing build dependencies in those respective systems. &nbsp;Everything is just automatic for those users.</div></div></blockquote><div><br></div>Yep</div><div><br><blockquote type="cite"><div dir="ltr">

<div><br></div><div>Since OMPI already ships all the generated atomics&nbsp;variants&nbsp;in the tarball, there is precedence in support of the alternative of per-generating all the Fortran wrapper variants. &nbsp;That does NOT address Brian's strong objection to adding a new language dependency, but moves the language dependency from the end-user to the developer, and hopefully only to those developers who modify the Fortran bindings.</div></div></blockquote><div><br></div>I suspect there is less objection to adding a language dependency to the tarball generator - the objections expressed so far were about adding python to the actual configure/compile stages.

&gt;* this isn't about Craig and his abilities - this is a more general<br>
&gt;requirements discussion. I personally wouldn't change my comments if it<br>
&gt;was Jeff or Brian making the request - the issue remains the same.<br>
&gt;Introducing another language requirement on the<br>
&gt; user-level build isn't a minor issue. Just because someone knows a<br>
&gt;language seems a weak argument - I had to learn perl to work on the build<br>
&gt;system too. The differences aren't that huge, and the barrier isn't that<br>
&gt;high.<br>
<br>
What Ralph said. &nbsp;My objections are largely to introducing another<br>
language dependency (we should strive to keep these as small in number as<br>
possible). &nbsp;As I said, I'm strongly against using Python in the build<br>
system (unless we replace all Perl with Python, which I doubt anyone wants<br>
to deal with). &nbsp;I have a slight preference for not using non-Bourne Shell<br>
things in the configure / make stages, but that's not anywhere near as<br>
strong as the dislike of adding new languages to support in the build<br>
system.<br>
