The ibm/final test does not call MPI_Abort directly.&nbsp; It is calling
MPI_Barrier after MPI_Finalize is called, which is a no-no.&nbsp; This is
detected and eventually the library calls ompi_mpi_abort().&nbsp; This is
very similar to MPI_Abort() which ultimately calls ompi_mpi_abort as
well.&nbsp; So, I guess I am saying for all intents and purposes, it calls
MPI_Abort.<br>

  <pre wrap="">I'll try to keep it in mind as I continue the errmgr work. I gather these tests all call MPI_Abort?

    <pre wrap="">With our MTT testing we have noticed a problem that has cropped up in the trunk.  There are some tests that are supposed to return a non-zero status because they are getting errors, but are instead returning 0.  This problem does not exist in r23022 but does exist in r23023.

One can use the ibm/final test to reproduce the problem.  An example of a passing case followed by a failing case is shown below.

Ralph, you want me to open a ticket on this?  Or do you just want to take a look.  I am asking you since you did the r23023 commit.
