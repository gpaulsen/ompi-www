      the RFC can be now closed and the consensus is semantic of
      opal_hwloc_base_get_relative_locality<br>
      will not be changed since this is not needed : the hang is a
      coll/ml bug, so it will be fixed within coll/ml.<br>

That makes perfect sense.

What about FCA_IS_LOCAL_PROCESS ?
Shall we keep it or shall we use directly OPAL_PROC_ON_LOCAL_NODE directly
?

Cheers

Hi Gilles

We discussed this at the devel conference this morning. The root cause of
the problem is a test in coll/ml that we feel is incorrect - it basically
checks to see if the proc itself is bound, and then assumes that all other
procs are similarly bound. This in fact is never guaranteed to be true as
someone could use the rank_file method to specify that some procs are to be
left unbound, while others are to be bound to specified cpus.

Nathan has looked at that check before and believes it isn't necessary.
All coll/ml really needs to know is that the two procs share the same node,
and the current locality algorithm will provide that information. We have
asked him to "fix" the coll/ml selection logic to resolve that situation.

After then discussing the various locality definitions, it was our feeling
that the current definition is probably the better one unless you have a
reason for changing it other than coll/ml. If so, we'd be happy to revisit
the proposal.

Make sense?
Ralph

          <pre wrap="">WHAT: semantic change of opal_hwloc_base_get_relative_locality

WHY:  make is closer to what coll/ml expects.

      Currently, opal_hwloc_base_get_relative_locality means "at what
level do these procs share cpus"
      however, coll/ml is using it as "at what level are these procs
commonly bound".

      it is important to note that if a task is bound to all the
available cpus, locality should
      be set to OPAL_PROC_ON_NODE only.
      /* e.g. on a single socket Sandy Bridge system, use
OPAL_PROC_ON_NODE instead of OPAL_PROC_ON_L3CACHE */

      This has been initially discussed in the devel mailing list
      <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/devel/2014/06/15030.php">http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/devel/2014/06/15030.php</a>

      as advised by Ralph, i browsed the source code looking for how the
(ompi_proc_t *)-&gt;proc_flags is used.
      so far, it is mainly used to figure out wether the proc is on the
same node or not.

      notable exceptions are :
       a) ompi/mca/sbgp/basesmsocket/sbgp_basesmsocket_component.c :
OPAL_PROC_ON_LOCAL_SOCKET
       b) ompi/mca/coll/fca/coll_fca_module.c and
oshmem/mca/scoll/fca/scoll_fca_module.c : FCA_IS_LOCAL_PROCESS

      about a) the new definition fixes a hang in coll/ml
      about b) FCA_IS_LOCAL_SOCKET looks like legacy code /* i could only
found OMPI_PROC_FLAG_LOCAL in v1.3 */
      so this macro can be simply removed and replaced with
OPAL_PROC_ON_LOCAL_NODE

      at this stage, i cannot find any objection not to do the described
change.
      please report if any and/or feel free to comment.

WHERE: see the two attached patches

TIMEOUT: June 30th, after the Open MPI developers meeting in Chicago,
June 24-26.
         The RFC will become final only after the meeting.
         /* Ralph already added this topic to the agenda */

Thanks

Gilles
