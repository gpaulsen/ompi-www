I thought it was necessary to be in line with a "stable version", not
with a snapshot of the trunk.<br>

No, I did not use this procedure:<br>
I cloned new-romio-for-openmpi, then I deleted all files and
subdirectories (excepted .hg and .hgignore)<br>
  <br>
I got openmpi-1.4.3.tar and untar it in the new-romio-for-openmpi
directory.<br>
Then I replace the romio branch by the romio branch from
new-romio-for-openmpi<br>
  <br>
After testing, I committed and pushed it in bitbucket.<br>
  <br>
I realize now that I have to go back to v1.5.<br>
What is the best way to do it ?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; - Synchro with the trunk?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Using<font color="#000000"> openmpi-1.5.tar.gz with the same
procedure I used to update with openmpi-1.4.3 ?<br>
&nbsp;</font><br>

Sorry,<br>
&nbsp; I was a bit confused with V1.5. I will have to synchronize with the
trunk. When do you think is the best time to do it ?<br>

      <pre wrap="">I just (re?)noticed that your mercurial tree is based on the 1.4 branch:

Are we targeting the v1.4 series for this?  

I thought we were targeting trunk/v1.5 for the new ROMIO, but perhaps I'm forgetting something...?

I see in your other mail that you pulled something from MPICH2 to make this work.

Does that mean that there's a even-newer version of ROMIO that we should pull in its entirety?  It's a little risky to pull most stuff from one released version of ROMIO and then more stuff from another released version.  Meaning: it's little nicer/safer to say that we have ROMIO from a single released version of MPICH2.  
If possible.  :-)

Is it possible?

Don't get me wrong -- I want the new ROMIO, and I'm sorry you've had to go through so many hoops to get it ready.  :-(  But we should do it the best way we can; we have history/precedent for taking ROMIO from a single source/released version of MPICH[2], and I'd like to maintain that precedent if at all possible.

        <pre wrap="">I've just made a comparison with the very last MPICH2 version (mpich2-1.3.1) and found very little differencies.

I've  reported them into bitbucket. I 've tested with the ROMIO tests and I 've commited them.

So, we now have on bitbucket the version from mpich2-1.3.1 plus the patch for the attribute issue.
