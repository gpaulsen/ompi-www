However, I agree that the phrasing of the warning is confusing, and adding a URL there to an appropriate page should be enough to prevent future questions like this in the support forum.<br><br></div>Thanks<br></div>Durga<br></div><div class="gmail_extra"><br clear="all"><div><div class="gmail_signature"><div dir="ltr"><div>1% of the executables have 99% of CPU privilege!<br></div>Userspace code!

&gt;&gt; I was under the impression that this warning script only ran for developer builds.  But it looks like it&#39;s unconditionally run at the end of &quot;make install&quot; (on master only -- so far).<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Should we make this only run for developer builds?  (e.g., check for $srcdir/.git, or somesuch)  I think it&#39;s our goal to have zero common symbols, but that may not always be the case, and we don&#39;t want this potentially alarming warning showing up for users, right?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; IMO, this is basically just another warning flag.  If you enable most compiler warnings for non-developer builds, I don&#39;t see why you would go out of your way to disable this particular one.  You could always tweak the output to point to a wiki page that explains what the warning means, so concerned users can hopefully be assuaged.<br>
<br>
</span>I guess this is where I differ. I see no benefit in warning a user about something they cannot control and that has no impact on them. These warnings were intended solely for developers as a reminder/suggestion that they follow a specific policy regarding common variables. Thus, they convey nothing of interest or use to a user.<br>
<br>
So I fail to see why we should include this warning in a non-developer build. As for other warnings, we have a stated policy (and proactive effort) to always stamp them out, so I don’t think the user is actually seeing many (or any) of them. Remember, we turn off pedantic and other levels when doing non-developer builds.<br>
<br>
Seems like this warning falls into the same category to me.<br>
