I&#39;m sorry; I&#39;m at the MPI Forum this week and not paying close attention to master commits.  Has your code to ensure to call the opal common verbs ibv_fork_init() stuff been pushed to master yet?  If so, then ibv_fork_init() *should* be getting called first, and there&#39;s something else going on that needs to be understood.<br>

&gt; Hi,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I will change the default of the opal_common_verbs_want_fork_support to -1 in order to avoid these messages in case ibv_fork_init() fails.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The reason why it is failing is that ibv_fork_init() is being called to late. To avoid this, every component should call ibv_fork_init() early in the init (in this case before oob/ud does) - call the opal_common_verbs_fork_test() function which does just that.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Paul, can you please check if adding this call to psm fixes the issue?<br>

&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; I think that warning is printed by libibverbs itself.  Are you 100% sure there are no IB HCAs sitting in the head node?  If there are IB HCAs but you don&#39;t want them to be used, you might want to ensure that the various verbs kernel modules don&#39;t get loaded, which is one half of the mismatch which confuses libibverbs.<br>
&gt; &gt; [...]<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; FWIW, I can confirm that these two lines are from libibverbs itself:<br>
&gt; &gt; $ strings /usr/lib64/libibverbs.a | grep -e &#39;no userspace&#39; -e &#39;open config directory&#39;<br>
&gt; &gt; libibverbs: Warning: no userspace device-specific driver found for %s<br>
&gt; &gt; libibverbs: Warning: couldn&#39;t open config directory &#39;%s&#39;.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Yes, I think you&#39;d also see the same message if you run &quot;ibv_devices&quot; or &quot;ibv_devinfo&quot; on the head node.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; As it happens, the login node *does* have an HCA installed and the kernel modules appears to be loaded.  However, as the &quot;17th node&quot; in the cluster it was never cabled to the 16-port switch and the package(s) that should have created/populated /etc/libibverbs.d are *not* present (specifically the login node has libipathverbs-devel installed but not libipathverbs).<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; So, Dave, are you saying that what I describe in the previous paragraph would be considered &quot;misconfiguration&quot;?  I am fine with dropping the discussion of those first two lines if there is agreement that Open MPI shouldn&#39;t be responsible for handling this case.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I would consider that to be a lesser misconfiguration, which is only really an issue because of libibverbs deficiencies.  Either the hardware could be removed from the head node or the kernel modules could be unloaded / prevented from loading on the head node.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Now the ibv_fork_init() warnings are another issue entirely.  Since btl:verbs and mtl:psm both work (at least separately) perfectly fine on the compute nodes, I don&#39;t believe that there are any configuration issues there.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Agreed, something needs to be improved there.  I assume that Mike D. or someone from his team will take a look.  I don&#39;t have any bandwidth to look at this myself.<br>
