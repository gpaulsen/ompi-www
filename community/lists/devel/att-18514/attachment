Kidding aside, ok, you make valid points.  So -- no tm &quot;addition&quot;.  We just have to rely on people using functionality like &quot;--with-tm&quot; in the configure line to force/ensure that tm (or whatever feature) will actually get built.<br>

&gt; I think we would be opening a real can of worms with this idea. There are environments, for example, that use PBSPro for one part of the system (e.g., IO nodes), but something else for the compute section.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Personally, I&#39;d rather follow Howard&#39;s suggestion.<br>

&gt; &gt; Hmm.  I&#39;m of split mind here.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; I can see what Howard is saying here -- adding complexity is usually a bad thing.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; But we have gotten these problem reports multiple times over the years: someone *thinking* that they have built with launcher support X (e.g., TM, LSF), but then figuring out later that things aren&#39;t running as expected, and after a bunch of work, figure out that it&#39;s because they didn&#39;t build with support X.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Gilles idea actually sounds interesting -- if the tm module detect some of the sentinel PBS/TM env variables, emit a show_help() if we don&#39;t have full TM support compiled in.  This would actually save some users a bunch of time and frustration.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; --&gt; Keep in mind that the SLRUM launcher is different, because it&#39;s all CLI-based (not API-based) and therefore we always build it (because we don&#39;t have to find headers and libraries).<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; FWIW, we do have precedent of having extra MCA params for users to turn off warnings that they don&#39;t want to see.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; I guess the question here is: is there a valid use case for running in PBS/Torque and *not* wanting to use the TM launcher?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Once case comes to mind. In the case of Cray systems that unfortunately<br>
&gt; run Moab/Toque we can launch using either alps or torque (Howard correct<br>
&gt; me if I am wrong). When Sam and I originally wrote the XE support we<br>
&gt; used alps instead of torque. I am not entirely sure what we do now.<br>
