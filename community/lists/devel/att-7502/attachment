If Josh is going to be at the forum, perhaps you folks could chat there? Might as well take advantage of being colocated, if possible.<br><br>Otherwise, I&#39;m available pretty much any time. I can&#39;t contribute much about the MPI recovery issues, but can contribute to the RTE issues if that helps.<br>

Next week is a little bit too early as will need some time to figure out how to integrate with this new framework, and at what extent our code and requirements fit into. Then the week after is the MPI Forum. How about on Thursday 11 March?<br>

  Thanks,<br>

&gt; Per my previous suggestion, would it be useful to chat on the phone early next week about our various strategies?<br>
