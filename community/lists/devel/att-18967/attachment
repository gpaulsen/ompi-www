    <p>the parameters on the webpage are for ompio in 2.x.  For 1.10 its
      a bit more complicated, you would have to set the number of
      aggregators for each fcoll component separatly, e.g.</p>
    <p>--mca fcoll two_phase_num_io_procs  x</p>
    <p>I would however start without setting the number of aggregators,
      since we do have some algorithms in ompio trying to predict the
      optimal number of aggregators. If you set these parameters, you
      are basically the algorithm. There might be very good reasons to
      override the algorithm (we are well aware of patterns where it
      will produce bad results), but the tile I/O patterns was one of
      the patterns it was originally designed for.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The coll_timing_info option is there in 1.10, but requires an
      additional change for  the compilation (that was supposed to be a
      configure flag, but we just haven't gotten around to implement the
      configure flag).  I would consider this however an option which is
      more of interest for developers than for users. If you want to use
      it anyway, I can tell you what you need to do to activate it.</p>
    <p>Thanks<br>

                                </div>
                                I am looking at the online FAQ for ompio<br>
                              </div>
                              which seems to show that the following
                              parameters are defined:<br>
                            </div>
                            io_ompio_num_aggregators<br>
                          </div>
                          io_ompio_call_timing<br>
                          <br>
                        </div>
                        But on OMPI version 1.10.1 or 1.8.3:<br>
                      </div>
                      1: setting mpirun -mca io ompio -mca
                      io_ompio_coll_timing_info<br>
                    </div>
                    appears to not produce a summary.<br>
                    <br>
                  </div>
                  2: io_ompio_num_aggregators is not listed as a
                  parameter<br>
                </div>
                as listed by<br>
              </div>
              ompi_info -a | grep ompio<br>
              <br>
            </div>
            Am I doing something wrong, or are these options not
            supported in these versions?<br>
