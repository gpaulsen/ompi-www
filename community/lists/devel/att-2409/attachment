Hi, <BR>
<BR>
I'm implementing a new MTL component that uses message queues to keep track of posted and unexpected messages. I intended to do this by creating two global queues, one for posted and one for unexpected, until I found that the portals MTL uses a different approach in their queue implemenation. The portal code uses handles to the queues from inside their mca_mtl_portals_module_t to post messages. I couldn't help but wonder, why are the queue handles here? What are the design implications of defining these handle queues in this module struct rather than globally defining them? <BR>
I'm an Open MPI newbie and sort of confused on the modular approach taken here and was hoping somebody could point out the pros and the cons of the two approaches. I guess my next question would be: In general, what would you put into a module struct and what wouldn't you? <BR>
I will appreciate any pointers that you could give me to help me understand this concept. <BR>
<BR>
Thanks in advance, <BR>
<BR>
