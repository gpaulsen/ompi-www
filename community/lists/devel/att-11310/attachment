hi,<br><br>i have been playing around with the code of the pessimist protocol and i have
 set it so to save some messages and some other specific information into a few files.<br>
<br>however i also need to be able to perform global checkpoint during execution.<br>i was wondering if it&#39;s possible to simultaneous set the mca 
parameters for both the coordinated checkpoint and the vprototocol at 
the same time, something like this:<br><br>mpirun -n 10 -am ft-enable-cr -mca crs blcr  -mca vprotocol pessimist prog<br>
<br>i have tried, but it seems that the vprotocol does not work with ft-enable-cr enable. is there a way to overcome this? or i&#39;m missing something?<br><br><br>thank you
