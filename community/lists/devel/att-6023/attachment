Hi folks<br><br>I encourage people to please look at your MTT outputs. As we are preparing to roll the 1.3.3 release, I am seeing a lot of problems on the branch:<br><br>1. timeouts, coming in two forms: (a) MPI_Abort hanging, and (b) collectives hanging (this is mostly on Solaris)<br>
<br>2. segfaults - mostly on sif, but occasionally elsewhere<br><br>3. daemon failed to report back - this was only on sif<br><br>We will need to correct many of these for the release - unless it proves to be due to trivial errors, I don&#39;t see how we will be ready to roll release candidates next week.<br>
<br>So let&#39;s please start taking a look at these?!<br><br>Ralph<br><br>
