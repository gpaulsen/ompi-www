  <div>HI Nik,<br>
  <br>
I tried the Sun Studio Performance Analyzer and it was able to profile
to application but not the openMPI source code. The source code was
empty in Sun Studio Performance Analyzer. I tried but i was not able to
get the profiling information of openMPI.<br>
  <br>
So i installed Vampir trace and i was able to get otf while suggested i
got the profiling information. But i fail to understand what i should
do now. <br>
  <span>1. Am i suppose to download additional information for trace
information visualization? Is the additional software this <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.ssl-id.net/www.vampir.eu/index.html">https://www.ssl-id.net/www.vampir.eu/index.html</a></span><br>
2. If not how can i visualize the trace information i got vampir-trace.<br>
  <br>
Sorry for bugging everyone so much about this. But i spend a lot of
time and this alone and i am not getting output. <br>

It's probably fine to bug people about some of this.&nbsp; OMPI would
benefit from having a tool ecosystem around it.&nbsp; There's VampirTrace
and PERUSE instrumentation and stuff, but some more activity/attention
in this area would be better.<br>
<br>
I don't know that VampirTrace will give what you're looking for.&nbsp; You
seem to want to profile the internals of OMPI.&nbsp; VT basically just
instruments entry into and exit out of MPI.&nbsp; In contrast, PERUSE
instruments MPI internals.<br>
<br>
Sun Studio Performance Analyzer should also work.&nbsp; I know I've used it
to profile both MPI apps and the internals of OMPI.<br>
<br>
One of the problems...&nbsp; I mean, one of the *features* of Sun
Performance Analyzer is that it *HIDES* the internals of the MPI
library.&nbsp; There is a concept of user and expert models and stuff.&nbsp; Most
users just want to see their program the way they wrote it (whether for
Java, OpenMP, MPI, etc.).&nbsp; So, Performance Analyzer hides the "black
box" stuff (internals of Java, OpenMP, MPI, etc.).&nbsp; But, *you* want
"expert" capabilities.&nbsp; You want to see what's under the hood.&nbsp; So,
after you have collected data and have started the Analyzer GUI, choose
"View" -&gt; "Show/Hide Functions..." -&gt; "Show All".&nbsp; Maybe there
are other things you're encountering, but for me that changes MPI calls
from being black boxes to exposing where OMPI is spending its time:&nbsp;
PML functions, BTL functions, etc.<br>
<br>
To get source code information, you also need to build OMPI with -g
turned on.&nbsp; That will include debugging information.&nbsp; With some
compilers, turning -g on might turn off optimizations... I just don't
know.&nbsp; With Sun Studio compilers, -g will not change your optimizations
-- it will only add debugging/symbolic information, compiler commentary
on optimizations, etc.<br>
<br>
If you want to ask Nik or me other questions, feel free.&nbsp; I'll send you
Nik's home phone number!&nbsp; :^)<br>
