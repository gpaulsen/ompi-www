Hello all,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I learnt from a reliable source that MPI uses the services provided by
TCP/IP or infiniband. Suppose that there is a bottle-neck in the TCP/IP
layer itself, how will optimization of MPI calls really help?<br>
<br>
thanks<br>
