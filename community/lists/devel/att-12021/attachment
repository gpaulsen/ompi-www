All,<div><br></div><div>By way of introduction, I&#39;m a TORQUE developer and I probably should&#39;ve joined this list - even if only to keep myself informed - years ago. </div><div><br></div><div>At any rate, we&#39;re in the process of changing TORQUE so that it compiles using g++ instead of gcc. We&#39;re starting to use some C++ constructs to make our lives easier. In doing this, we&#39;ve noticed that OpenMPI doesn&#39;t like TORQUE&#39;s libraries when built by gcc, it fails at the configure time claiming in can&#39;t find tm_init() in libtorque.so. I&#39;ve been trying to track down exactly why, and where I am now is making me think that something in the configure script is assuming that TORQUE&#39;s libraries are compiled by gcc. Is there someone who could advise me on how to resolve this issue?<br clear="all">
