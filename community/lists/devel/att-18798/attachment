&gt; Just to clarify, I was doing a build (after adding code to support a new transport) from code pulled from git (a &#39;git clone&#39;) when I came across this warning, so I suppose this would be a &#39;developer build&#39;.<br>
<br>
No worries.  I only brought it up because this is currently on master (and not v2.x), but it will eventually end up in a release branch -- even if it&#39;s v3.0.0.  So it&#39;s something we&#39;d want figure out before it hits the release branch.<br>
<br>
&gt; I know I am not a real MPI developer (I am doing OMPI internal development for the second time in my whole career), but if my vote counts, I&#39;d vote for leaving the warning in.<br>
<br>
I don&#39;t know why you keep pretending that you&#39;re not an OMPI developer.  :-)<br>
<br>
You&#39;re developing a BTL and asking all kinds of good questions about the code, and that&#39;s good enough for all of us.<br>
<br>
&gt; It, in my opinion, encourages good coding practice, that should matter to everyone, not just &#39;core developers&#39;. However, I agree that the phrasing of the warning is confusing, and adding a URL there to an appropriate page should be enough to prevent future questions like this in the support forum.<br>
<br>
FWIW: I think I agree with Ralph on this one.  Yes, we should make those common symbols zero.  But a user seeing this warning will likely be concerned, and there&#39;s nothing they can do about it.  So I think it should be a &quot;developer only&quot; kind of warning.<br>
