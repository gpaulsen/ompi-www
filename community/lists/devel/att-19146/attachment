<div dir="ltr">I added a feature to IBM&#39;s Jenkins setup yesterday that other orgs doing Jenkins CI testing might find helpful to add as well.<div><br></div><div>We have the retest target for all of the Jenkins systems to re-test a particular PR:</div><div> <b>bot:retest</b></div><div><br></div><div>I wanted an additional target that would trigger only the IBM Jenkins to re-test. This is helpful if we have a local issue with our Jenkins setup and don&#39;t want to force all of the Jenkins CI tests to fire at other organizations.</div><div><br></div><div>So as of today you can specify the following to just get the IBM CI tests to re-test:</div><div> <b>bot:ibm:retest</b></div><div><br></div><div>It might take a few minutes to kick off the build since we use a polling model (~2-5 minutes), but it will kick off only the IBM Jenkins CI tests. You can still use the &quot;bot:retest&quot; target to trigger all of the Jenkins services including IBM to re-test.</div><div><br></div><div>I hope folks find this useful when working on PRs.</div><div><br></div><div>-- Josh</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>For those organizations interested in how to set this up here are the instructions - just adjusting the regular expression used in the build trigger:</div><div><div><br></div><div>1) Enter the &#39;configuration&#39; in the Jenkins project you have setup to track GitHub PRs</div><div>2) Under &quot;Build Triggers&quot; -&gt; &quot;GitHub Pull Request Builder&quot;</div><div> - Click on &quot;Advanced...&quot;</div><div> - Set &quot;Trigger phrase&quot; to</div><div>  .*bot:(ibm:)?retest.*</div></div><div><br></div><div>Set the &#39;ibm&#39; to your organization&#39;s short name, whatever you want it to be. Then let the list know.</div></div>
