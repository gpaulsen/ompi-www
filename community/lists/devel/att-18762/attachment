<div dir="ltr">Hi Folks,<div><br></div><div>So we have this brand-new omnipath cluster here at work,</div><div>but people are having problem using it on a single node using</div><div>srun as the job launcher.</div><div><br></div><div>The customer wants to use srun to launch jobs not the open mpi</div><div>mpirun.  </div><div><br></div><div>The customer installed 1.10.1, but I can reproduce the</div><div>problem with v2.x and I&#39;m sure with master, unless I build the</div><div>ofi mtl.  ofi mtl works, psm2 mtl doesn&#39;t.</div><div><br></div><div>I downloaded the psm2 code from github and started hacking.</div><div><br></div><div>What appears to be the problem is that when running on a single </div><div>node one can go through a path in psmi_ep_open_device where</div><div>for a single process job, the value stored into epid is zero.</div><div><br></div><div>This results in an assert failing in the __psm2_ep_open_internal</div><div>function.</div><div><br></div><div>Is there a quick and dirty workaround that doesn&#39;t involve fixing</div><div>psm2 MTL?  I could suggest to the sysadmins to install libfabric 1.3</div><div>and build the openmpi to only have ofi mtl, but perhaps there&#39;s</div><div>another way to get psm2 mtl to work for single node jobs?  I&#39;d prefer</div><div>to not ask users to disable psm2 mtl explicitly for their single node jobs.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks for suggestions.</div><div><br></div><div>Howard</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div>
