<div dir="ltr">Dear all,<br><div class="gmail_extra"><div class="gmail_quote"><br>I am trying to learn how Open MPI works. Followed many instructions on Web, I tried to setup MPI Hello projects on Eclipse PTP. I am wondering if there is any protocol to setup such an environment.<br><br>I did try a few combination, but still stuck at the point where sometimes there are:<br>1. little bugs symbol showing on the left panel (next to the line numbers) while debugging. Things like &quot;Symbol &#39;ompi_mpi_finalized&#39; could not be resolved&quot;. I think this is due to environmental variables or paths not being set correctly, but I don&#39;t know what I have missed.<br>2. Cannot toggle breakpoints or toggled breakpoints being set on a relative file path. This makes the threads not stopping at the breakpoints.<br><br>My environment is CentOS 6.6 running on a machine with 32GB memory, and Intel i7-3770. Since I am still experimenting on local debugging, I am debugging on Generic Open MPI Interactive with connection type local or remotely to 127.0.0.1, and with only a few processes. Detailed Eclipse installation configuration attached.<br><br>My Open MPI is configured as<br>../configure --enable-debug --enable-event-debug --enable-mem-debug --enable-mem-profile<br>The compiler is GNU C compiler.<br><br>This gives a lot of information in the console while debugging but not very useful. I am not sure if I should run &#39;make install&#39; for Open MPI to /usr, or simply set Open MPI source tree as part of the project, or both. Open MPI has examples folder but I don&#39;t know how to use the code directly as my source code. For now I can step into source code of Open MPI, but sometimes I cannot toggle breakpoints. Attached is my current debug configuration.<br><br>Good day,<br><br>Alvyn<br><br>A screen shot:<br><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/s105m2qgi14oj2y/Screenshot-Parallel%20Debug%20-%20ompitest-build-ompi-mpi-c-profile-pinit.c%20-%20Eclipse%20.png?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/s/s105m2qgi14oj2y/Screenshot-Parallel%20Debug%20-%20ompitest-build-ompi-mpi-c-profile-pinit.c%20-%20Eclipse%20.png?dl=0</a></div><br></div><div class="gmail_extra">Eclipse configuration:</div><div class="gmail_extra"><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/5fnrqyga842w0e0/eclipse.conf?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/s/5fnrqyga842w0e0/eclipse.conf?dl=0</a><br></div><div class="gmail_extra"><br></div></div>
