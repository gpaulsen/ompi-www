<FONT FACE="Calibri, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><SPAN STYLE='font-size:11pt'>Let me start the e-mail conversation, and see how far we get.<BR>
<BR>
Goal: The goal several of us have is to be able to use the btl&#8217;s outside of the MPI layer in Open MPI. &nbsp;The layer itself is generic, w/o specific knowledge of Upper Level Protocols, so is well suited for this sort of use.<BR>
<BR>
Technical Approach: What we have suggested is to start the process with the Open MPI code base, and make it independent of the mpi-layer (which it is now), and the run-time layer.<BR>
<BR>
Before we get into any specific technical details,<BR>
the first question I have is are people totally opposed to the notion of making the btl&#8217;s independent of MPI and the run-time ?<BR>
This does not mean that it can&#8217;t be used by it, but that there are well defined abstraction layers, i.e., are people against the goal in the first place ?<BR>
<BR>
What are alternative suggestions to the technical approach ?<BR>
<BR>
One suggestion has been to branch and patch. &nbsp;To me this is a long-term maintenance nightmare.<BR>
<BR>
What are peoples thoughts here ?<BR>
