&gt; While looking the MPI_Testany issue, I came across a very unsettling sentence in the MPI standard (3.0 page 58 line 36).<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; The array is indexed from zero in C, and from one in Fortran.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; This sentence seems to indicate that the index returned by the TestAny and TestSome (as well as the corresponding Wait functions) should be indexed starting from 1 in Fortran, but from 0 in C. Our C code returns all indexes starting from 0 (C), but I failed to find where we handle this case in Fortran? Or maybe I am interpreting too much the MPI standard?<br>

</div></div>Jeff is Mr. Fortran, so I&#39;ll let him answer more definitely, but in the meantime you could try running this test from the MPICH test suite:<br>
<br>
<a href="http://git.mpich.org/mpich.git/blob/v3.0:/test/mpi/f77/pt2pt/allpairf.f" target="_blank">http://git.mpich.org/mpich.git/blob/v3.0:/test/mpi/f77/pt2pt/allpairf.f</a><br>
<br>
Surely there must be a test in ompi-tests that covers this area too.<br>
