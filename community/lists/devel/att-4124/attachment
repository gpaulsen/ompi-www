&gt;&gt; Hi all -<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Per the RFC I sent out last week, I&#39;ve implemented a revised behavior of<br>
&gt;&gt; the memory hooks for high speed networks. &nbsp;It&#39;s a bit different than the<br>
&gt;&gt; RFC proposed, but still very minor and fairly straight foward.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; The default is to build ptmalloc2 support, but as an almost complete<br>
&gt;&gt; standalone library. &nbsp;If the user wants to use ptmalloc2, he only has to add<br>
&gt;&gt; -lopenmpi-malloc to his link line. &nbsp;Even when standalone and openmpi-malloc<br>
&gt;&gt; is not linked in, we&#39;ll still intercept munmap as it&#39;s needed for mallopt<br>
&gt;&gt; (below) and we&#39;ve never had any trouble with that part of ptmalloc2 (it&#39;s<br>
&gt;&gt; easy to intercept).<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; As a *CHANGE* in behavior, if leave_pinned support is turned on and there&#39;s<br>
&gt;&gt; no ptmalloc2 support, we will automatically enable mallopt. &nbsp;As a *CHANGE*<br>
&gt;&gt; in behavior, if the user disables mallopt or mallopt is not available and<br>
&gt;&gt; leave pinned is requested, we&#39;ll abort. &nbsp;I think these both make sense and<br>
&gt;&gt; are closest to expected behavior, but wanted to point them out. &nbsp;It is<br>
&gt;&gt; possible for the user to disable mallopt and enable leave_pinned, but that<br>
&gt;&gt; will *only* work if there is some other mechanism for intercepting free<br>
&gt;&gt; (basically, it allows a way to ensure your using ptmalloc2 instead of<br>
&gt;&gt; mallopt).<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; There is also a new memory component, mallopt, which only intercepts munmap<br>
&gt;&gt; and exists only to allow users to enable mallopt while not building the<br>
&gt;&gt; ptmalloc2 component at all. &nbsp;Previously, our mallopt support was lacking in<br>
&gt;&gt; that it didn&#39;t cover the case where users explicitly called munmap in their<br>
&gt;&gt; applications. &nbsp;Now, it does.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; The changes are fairly small and can be seen/tested in the HG repository<br>
&gt;&gt; bwb/mem-hooks, URL below. &nbsp;I think this would be a good thing to push to<br>
&gt;&gt; 1.3, as it will solve an ongoing problem on Linux (basically, users getting<br>
&gt;&gt; screwed by our ptmalloc2 implementation).<br>
