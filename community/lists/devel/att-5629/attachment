<div>Hi everyone,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I&#39;m currently writing my own BTL component that utilises a lightweight Linux socket module. It wouldn&#39;t have nearly as  much functionality as a TCP/IP socket but it does the job and I managed to add a simple polling function into the module, it sleeps for whatever amount of time is entered in user space then checks various things (if any messages have come in) and returns the mask. It&#39;s simple and probably not the best, but it works for the moment. :-)</div>

<div> </div>
<div>I&#39;m curious as to how I can can get this into the OPAL event system. I see it&#39;s based on libevent and after reading through the documentation I can see what it does but now how to make it work in my circumstance. It says it supports select(2) and poll(2) but when calling event_set() the only parameter I seem to be able to set is EV_READ or EV_WRITE, there&#39;s nothing further to indicate I want to poll the file descriptor (as opposed to calling select on it). Maybe I&#39;m missing something without realising, but should my socket module be implementing some function to reveal what ways it can be queried for the presence of information? If not, maybe somebody has an idea of how I can make it work with the OPAL event system.</div>

<div>Any advice or information would be greatly appreciated.</div>

<div>Kind regards</div>
