I believe it is there, but correct me if not. All of the component configure.m4s depend on a test for sockaddr_in, which I believe RS will fail - yes?<br><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Tue, Aug 31, 2010 at 2:42 PM, Barrett, Brian W <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:bwbarre@sandia.gov">bwbarre@sandia.gov</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br>

My Red Storm dev cluster isn&#39;t working right now, but I didn&#39;t see an option for no if support at all.  Did I miss it, or are we going to have to add it later?<br>

Thanks,<br>

&gt; Per a discussion on the devel telecon a week or two ago, I have refactored the opal/util/if.c code into a static framework (ala the installdirs implementation) so that the various cases are dealt with in configure.m4 instead of a mass of interwoven #if-#else clauses. Jeff will undoubtedly do some cleanup of the configury magic, but the basic functionality is ready for initial review.<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; For those who care, please clone and check the code at <a href="http://bitbucket.org/rhc/ompi-if" target="_blank">http://bitbucket.org/rhc/ompi-if</a> to ensure that the correct opal/mca/if components are being built for your environment, and that the discovered interfaces are correct. Please let me know (up or down) so we can get a feel for how close we are to bringing this back to the trunk.<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; Thanks<br>
