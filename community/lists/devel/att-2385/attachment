I will have an agenda out in a week or so, so if people have specific items they want<BR>
&nbsp;to include, please send them to the list. &nbsp;The intent of this meeting is to get organized<BR>
&nbsp;for actively restarting MPI-forum activities, so items along those lines, and maybe a<BR>
&nbsp;list of initial topics of interest (not for technical discussion on 11/14) would be good<BR>
&nbsp;topics.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks,<BR>
Rich<BR>

&gt; At the Euro PVM/MPI meeting in Paris, the participants agreed to<BR>
&gt; hold a<BR>
&gt; meeting at SC'07 to help restart MPI-Forum activities. &nbsp;I am making<BR>
&gt; arrangements for this meeting, and am targeting to have this on<BR>
&gt; Wed, Nov.<BR>
&gt; 14th 5:30pm - 7:00 pm in Reno. &nbsp;I know that this will not be a good<BR>
&gt; time for<BR>
&gt; all, but looking over the list of BOF's this seems to be the best<BR>
&gt; time to do<BR>
&gt; this. &nbsp;I will let people know when details are firmed up, but<BR>
&gt; wanted to let<BR>
&gt; people know about the current tentative time, and ask people to start<BR>
&gt; passing the word around.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Thanks,<BR>
&gt; Rich<BR>
