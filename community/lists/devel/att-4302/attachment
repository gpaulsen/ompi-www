I think this is very reasonable to go ahead and include for 1.3.&nbsp; I find that preferable to a 1.3-specific &quot;wonky&quot; workaround.&nbsp; Plus, this sounds like something that is very good to have in general.<br><br>--brad<br>

v1.3 RMs: Due to some recent work, the MCA parameter mpi_paffinity_alone disappeared -- it was moved and renamed to be opal_paffinity_alone. &nbsp;This is Bad because we have a lot of historical precent based on the MCA param name &quot;mpi_paffinity_alone&quot; (FAQ, PPT presentations, e-mails on public lists, etc.). &nbsp;So it needed to be restored for v1.3. &nbsp;I just noticed that I hadn&#39;t opened a ticket on this -- sorry -- I opened #1383 tonight.<br>

<br>
For a variety of reasons described in the commit message r1383, Lenny and I first decided that it would be best to fix this problem by the functionality committed in r18770 (have the ability to find out where an MCA parameter was set). &nbsp;This would allow us to register two MCA params: mpi_paffinity_alone and opal_paffinity_alone, and generally do the Right Thing (because we could then tell if a user had set a value or whether it was a default MCA param value). &nbsp;This functionality will also be useful in the openib BTL, where there is a blend of MCA parameters and INI file parameters.<br>

<br>
However, after doing that, it seemed like only a few more steps to implement an overall better solution: implement &quot;synonyms&quot; for MCA parameters. &nbsp;I.e., register the name &quot;mpi_paffinity_alone&quot; as a synonym for opal_paffinity_alone. &nbsp;Along the way, it was trivial to add a &quot;deprecated&quot; flag for MCA parameters that we no longer want to use anymore (this deprecated flag is also useful in the OB1 PML and openib BTL).<br>

<br>
So to fix a problem that needed to be fixed for v1.3 (restore the MCA parameter &quot;mpi_paffinity_alone&quot;), I ended up implementing new functionality.<br>
<br>
Can this go into v1.3, or do we need to implement some kind of alternate fix? &nbsp;(I admit to not having thought through what it would take to fix without the new MCA parameter functionality -- it might be kinda wonky)<br><font color="#888888">
