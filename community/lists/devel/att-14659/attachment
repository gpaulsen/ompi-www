<div dir="ltr"><div>Hi, OMPI Community<br><br>On the call yesterday, Ralph and Jeff posed the question to the Community at large and to NVIDIA in particular if they/we/us have a vested interest in heterogeneous support. Mellanox and NVIDIA are partnering on systems that, on today&#39;s roadmap, could require heterogeneous support from the underlying MPI. At the moment, it&#39;s not known if this will remain an issue. Today it appears it is, but tomorrow it may not be. So, anyhow, to answer the question: Yes, there are core OMPI developers and industrial partners for whom this support appears to be important given the current state of the art.<br>

&gt; My concern was more about the â€œwhat&quot; factor: what do you write on remote memory in a heterogeneous case. I imagine you can either write the converted data or you can convert remotely after writing. Anyway, on both cases you need intermediary buffers to do the conversion (especially if we are looking a size mismatch), so the interest of RMA is quickly vanishing.<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; For now, I would just not support heterogeneous environments for RMA. We might want to add a check at windows creation time, so at least the users are warned.<br>
<br>
</div>Good point. I will look at adding a warning now.<br>
