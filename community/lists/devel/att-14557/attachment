Teaching students SCM, Git is probably the most difficult since the initial learning curve is steeper than Mercurial, and they can easily get turned around with some of the more complex features they find on their own. SVN is the easiest to teach, but the most restrictive and requires dedicated a hosting server in the department.</div>
<div><br></div><div>We are having a similar discussion in our department at the moment regarding which SCM system we should expose students to in the upper level courses. Currently, we have started (past year and a half) using Git in at least 2 classes. Previously, students were not really exposed to SCM except if they did some independent research. It is too early to tell how successful that has been.</div>

- SVN<br>
- Mercurial<br>
- Git<br>

I ask this question because there&#39;s serious discussions afoot to switch OMPI&#39;s main SVN repo to Git, and I want to get a feel for the current landscape out there.<br>
