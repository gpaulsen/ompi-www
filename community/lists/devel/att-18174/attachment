<div dir="ltr">Okay, please try the attached patch. It will cause two messages to be output for each job: one indicating the job has been marked terminated, and the other reporting that the completion message was sent to the requestor.

&gt; Okay, so each orte-submit is reporting job has launched, which means the hang is coming while waiting to hear the job completed. Are you sure that orte-dvm believes the job has completed?<br>
<br>
</span>No, I&#39;m not.<br>
<span class=""><br>
&gt; In other words, when you say that you observe the job as completing, are you basing that on some output from orte-dvm, or because the procs have exited, or...?<br>
<br>
</span>... because the tasks have created their output.<br>
<span class=""><br>
&gt; I can send you a patch tonight that would cause orte-dvm to emit a &quot;job completed&quot; message when it determines each job has terminated - might help us take the next step.<br>
<br>
</span>Great.<br>
<span class=""><br>
&gt; I&#39;m wondering if orte-dvm thinks the job is still running, and the race condition is in that area (as opposed to being in orte-submit itself)<br>
<br>
</span>Do some counts from the output of orte-dvm provide some hints?<br>
<br>
<br>
$ grep &quot;Releasing job data.*INVALID&quot; dvm_output.txt |wc -l<br>
      42<br>
<br>
$ grep &quot;ORTE_DAEMON_SPAWN_JOB_CMD&quot; dvm_output.txt |wc -l<br>
      42<br>
<br>
$ grep &quot;ORTE_DAEMON_ADD_LOCAL_PROCS&quot; dvm_output.txt |wc -l<br>
      42<br>
<br>
$ grep &quot;sess_dir_finalize&quot; dvm_output.txt |wc -l<br>
      35<br>
<br>
<br>
In other words, the &quot;[netbook:XXXX] sess_dir_finalize: proc session dir does not exist&quot; message doesn&#39;t show up for the hanging ones, which could support your question that the orte-dvm is at fault.<br>
