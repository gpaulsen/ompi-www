<br>
The v2.x series is a new series which includes many new features and under-the-hood improvements.  Many of these features and improvements were discussed in the Open MPI SC&#39;15 State of the Union BOF; the slides are available here:<br>

<br>
Additionally, as the change in the first digit indicates, the v2.x series is not (binary) backwards compatible with the v1.10 series.  Specifically: MPI and OpenSHMEM applications will need to be recompiled against v2.0.0, and will need to use the v2.x &quot;mpirun&quot; and support libraries.  Slides 9-12 in the BOF slides (linked above) explain Open MPI&#39;s (relatively new) version numbering scheme.<br>
<br>
We do not expect to release v2.0.0 until January at the earliest; we wanted to make some early release candidates available to the Open MPI user community to get some real-world testing, and to get feedback before the final release becomes available.<br>
<br>
The v2.0.0 release candidate tarballs are available at the same location where the final release tarballs will be available:<br>
