I have compressed the information from 'ompi-info --all' in the attachment.</div><div><br></div><div>For some more related information, I have been tuning the configuration settings for a while, and I am afraid some of them may not be quite appropriate. My general goal is to enable message passing in my system of several such chips connected via Ethernet. So I will not launch more than one process on any single machine. That's why I wanted to disable the shared memory support. Although that doesn't change the outcome for me.</div>

<div>I also got a lot of error messages on mca failing to find components, that is why I tried disable dlopen.</div><div><br></div><div>I am also looking for suggestions. Basically I want to compile a "clean" version of OpenMPI with only the core message passing support, that may automatically get rid of a lot of the headache of the cross-compilation.&nbsp;</div>

<div>When I searched through the documentation, I came to notice the idea of Portable Hardware locality (hwloc), however, the idea is completely new to me so I do not know if that would be relevant for my case.</div><div>
