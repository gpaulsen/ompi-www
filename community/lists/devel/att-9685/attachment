Hi,<br>I am trying to explore the details of connection establishment in OpenMPI using libibcm/librdmacm.  In the code, I could not find how OpenMPI app is getting service-id/lid of remote node to which it wants to connect.  Also, I did not see any query in the code related to service_record_get from SA.  Can you please desribe what is happening OR Am I missing something here ?<br>
<br>Thanks &amp; Regards,<br>Ramu    <br>
