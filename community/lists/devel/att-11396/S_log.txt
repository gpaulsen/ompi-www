A process failed to create a queue pair. This usually means either
the device has run out of queue pairs (too many connections) or
there are insufficient resources available to allocate a queue pair
(out of memory). The latter can happen if either 1) insufficient
memory is available, or 2) no more physical memory can be registered
with the device.

For more information on memory registration see the Open MPI FAQs at:
http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=openfabrics#ib-locked-pages

mpiexec has exited due to process rank 3 with PID 27807 on
node linuxbmc0373 exiting improperly. There are two reasons this could occur:

1. this process did not call "init" before exiting, but others in
the job did. This can cause a job to hang indefinitely while it waits
for all processes to call "init". By rule, if one process calls "init",
then ALL processes must call "init" prior to termination.

2. this process called "init", but exited without calling "finalize".
By rule, all processes that call "init" MUST call "finalize" prior to
exiting or it will be considered an "abnormal termination"

This may have caused other processes in the application to be
terminated by signals sent by mpiexec (as reported here).
