<div>Hi foks,</div><div><br></div><div>Sorry to bother you guys, but I have some questions about Open MPI and really want your help.</div><div><br></div><div>There are some papers (e.g., [1, 2, 3], although they are sort of old-aged) mentioning that Open MPI is supporting NIC failover and message stripping over multiple NICs. However, when I read the source code of openmpi-1.6.2, I couldn&#39;t find any component named DR or TEG (which are mentioned in those papers and are supposed to support NIC failover and message stripping). So my question is:</div>
<div><br></div><div><b>Does the 1.6.2 release of Open MPI support such two kinds of functionalities? If positive, which part of code is corresponding to these functionalities?</b></div><div><br></div><div>Many thanks in advance.</div>
<div><br></div><div>P.S., I am a newbie of this domain. Maybe my questions are simple even naive, but your help would be highly appreciated.</div><div><br></div><div>Best,</div><div>Lirong</div><div><br></div><div><br></div>
