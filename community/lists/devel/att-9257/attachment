We have identified a need in certain high performance applications to specify memory sections -&gt; L3 -&gt; L2 - &gt;L1 -&gt; specific core -&gt; specific CPU -&gt; specific machine. These tend toward hybridized CUDA apps where other sections of the CPU are involved in non-CUDA (non-GPU) functions.&nbsp; In our discussions, however, we haven't come across others who see the same need. IOW, we are a very small market.<BR>

    I see in the sm BTL that there is the concept of memory affinity and the potential to support multiple memory pools.&nbsp; I am curious if anyone is making use of that feature?&nbsp; I am looking in the function sm_btl_first_time_init() in the btl_sm.c file.<BR>
