<br class="">
I'm guessing we'll talk about this at the Feb dev meeting, but we need to think about this a bit before hand.&nbsp; Here's a little more fuel for the fire: let's at least specify the problem space a bit more precisely...<br class="">
<br class="">
(this item is on the agenda for the Feb dev meeting, but we all need to think about this a little before then; it's a complicated set of issues)<br class="">
<br class="">
One (not-even-half-baked) idea that was raised on the call last week was the idea of 3 levels of specifying networks:<br class="">
<br class="">
1. Automatic selection.&nbsp; "mpirun a.out" -- OMPI does all the selection for the user.<br class="">
2. High-level abstraction.&nbsp; "mpirun &lt;SOME NICE EASY-TO-UNDERSTAND CLI OPTIONS&gt; a.out"<br class="">
3. Low-level specification.&nbsp; "mpirun --mca btl usnic,sm,self a.out"<br class="">
<br class="">
#1 and #3 already exist today: #1 is for most users, #3 is for OMPI experts.<br class="">
<br class="">
#2 is the new thing.&nbsp; It's intended for those who have a clue about what they want, but they aren't necessarily OMPI or networking experts.&nbsp; The trick is defining what &lt;SOME NICE EASY-TO-UNDERSTAND CLI OPTIONS&gt; is.<br class="">
<br class="">
The selection space is complicated -- it has (at least?) three dimensions:<br class="">
<br class="">
1. First, we have network types:<br class="">
<br class="">
a. Ethernet<br class="">
b. InfiniBand<br class="">
c. uGNI<br class="">
d. InfiniPath<br class="">
e. OmniScale<br class="">
f. Shared memory<br class="">
g. SCIF<br class="">
<br class="">
2. Second, we have network APIs:<br class="">
<br class="">
a. TCP<br class="">
b. usNIC (via libfabric)<br class="">
c. Verbs<br class="">
d. MXM<br class="">
e. uGNI<br class="">
f. PSM<br class="">
g. PSM2<br class="">
h. POSIX shared memory segments<br class="">
i. xpmem<br class="">
j. knem<br class="">
k. Linux CMA<br class="">
l. SCIF<br class="">
<br class="">
3. Third, we have Open MPI networking layers:<br class="">
<br class="">
a. PML OB1 (and associated BTLs)<br class="">
b. PML CM (and associated MTL)<br class="">
c. PML BFO<br class="">
d. PML crcpw<br class="">
e. PML v<br class="">
f. PML Yalla<br class="">
g. PML UCX (soon)<br class="">
<br class="">
These three spaces can be combined in specific ways (E.g., Ethernet / TCP / PML OB1 + BTLs).<br class="">
BTLs have the added complication that multiple can be used in a single job.<br class="">
Some network types can be accessed through multiple combinations.<br class="">
Obviously, not all combinations are sensible (e.g., uGNI / PSM2 / PML Yalla).<br class="">
<br class="">
The Big Issues here are:<br class="">
<br class="">
- the user generally only knows about the first dimension: network type.<br class="">
- the OMPI networking layer names are generally not meaningful unless you're an OMPI expert.<br class="">
<br class="">
So how do we present a "simple" / "higher-level abstraction" for the average user?<br class="">
<br class="">
<br class="">

&gt; Rolf: can you add this to the agenda?<br class="">
&gt;<br class="">
&gt; We're now adding multiple ways to get to the same underlying network transport, and it's getting confusing for users (I've fielded several off-list questions from users about this issue).<br class="">
&gt;<br class="">
&gt; - MXM: can be accessed via Yalla, the MXM MTL, (soon) UCX, and (soon) libfabric<br class="">
&gt; - PSM: can be accessed via the PSM MTL and libfabric<br class="">
&gt; - verbs: can be accessed via the openib BTL and libfabric<br class="">
&gt; - PSM2: ditto<br class="">
&gt; - uGNI: can be accessed via the uGNI BTL, portals(4?), and (soon) UCX<br class="">
&gt; - shared memory: can be accessed via sm, vader, and (soon) UCX<br class="">
&gt;<br class="">
&gt; But you can also look at this from a different perspective:<br class="">
&gt;<br class="">
&gt; - IB: can be used via Yalla, MXM MTL, UCX, libfabric (multiple ways)<br class="">
&gt; - RoCE: can be used via ^^some (or all? I'm not sure) of these<br class="">
&gt; - Cray: can be used via the uGNI BTL, portals(4?), and (soon) UCX<br class="">
&gt;<br class="">
&gt; ...what's a user supposed to use?<br class="">
&gt;<br class="">
&gt; And more specifically, how can a user enable or disable a specific type of network?&nbsp; Or API?<br class="">
&gt;<br class="">
&gt; A recent (off list) example I had was a user who was frustrated trying to figure out how to disable all forms of MXM (note: this is a larger issue than just MXM).<br class="">
&gt;<br class="">
&gt; Bottom line: underlying networks can be accessed through multiple upper-layer APIs, and it creates both a mapping problem for the MPI implementation, and a usability issue for users trying to be specific about which network(s) they want the MPI implementation to use.<br class="">
&gt;<br class="">
&gt; I don't have a solution (or even a proposal) here.&nbsp; This is something we need to think / talk about.<br class="">
