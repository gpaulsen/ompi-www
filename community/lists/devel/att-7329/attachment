Dear Josh and Paul.<br>
<br>
First of all, thank you very much for your interesting on my problem.<br>
<br>
1) I tested it again with MPIRUN_CMD as &#39;mpirun -am ft-enable-cr -np %N %P&#39;<br>
  But the checkpoint did not work.<br>
<br>
Is it giving the same error?<br>
<br>
Can you send me information on how you configured Open MPI on your system?<br>
<br>
Yes, it gives the same error.<br>
<br>
When was installing the open-mpi-1.3.3, I used the following configuration.<br>
<br>
./configure --enable-ft-thread --with-ft=cr --enable-mpi- threads --with-blcr={BLCR_DIR} --with-blcr-libdir={BLCR_LIBDIR} --<br>
prefix={OPENMPI_DIR}<br>
<br>
What kind of configuration information do you need?<br>

<br></div>
This looks fine to me.<div class="im"><br>

<br>
2) Here are the more information on my MPI configuration.<br>
 - What version of Open MPI are you using?<br>
  &gt;&gt; I am using Open-MPI ver 1.3.3 with BLCR ver 0.8.2<br>
<br>
 - How did you configure Open MPI?<br>
  &gt;&gt; ./configure --enable-ft-thread --with-ft=cr --enable-mpi-threads --with-blcr={BLCR_DIR} --with-blcr-libdir={BLCR_LIBDIR} --prefix={OPENMPI_DIR}<br>
<br>
 - What arguments are being passed to &#39;mpirun&#39; when running with GASNet?<br>
  &gt;&gt; mpirun -am ft-enable-cr --machinefile ./machinefile -np 1 ./personal<br>
<br>
The &#39;-np 1&#39; argument is a bit puzzling to me, don&#39;t you want this to be &gt;1 normally. GASNet does not use any MPI dynamic process management interfaces (e.g., MPI_Comm_spawn), does it?<br>
<br>
Sorry, actually I do not know if GASNet uses a MPI dynamic process management or not.<br>
<br>

It probably does not (not many applications do), but it could be a problem if they do.<div class="im"><br>

<br>
  &gt;&gt; personal is the same probram, my-app.c except for using gasnet_init and gasnet_exit() instead of MPI_Init() and MPI_Finalize().<br>
  &gt;&gt; my-app.c is in <a href="http://osl.iu.edu/research/ft/ompi-cr/" target="_blank">http://osl.iu.edu/research/ft/ompi-cr/</a>examples.php.<br>
  &gt;&gt; gasnet_init() and gasnet_exit() use MPI_Init() and MPI_Finalize().<br>
<br>
So you are using the program from the SELF checkpoint example? If Open MPI detects that the application has the appropriate function callbacks to use the SELF CRS (which this example does) then it will -not- use the BLCR component, but instead select the SELF component.<br>

<br>
Try using a simple counting program instead of that particular example. You could also just remove the opal_crs_self_user_* and my_personal_* functions form the example program to reduce it to one.<br>
<br>
I&#39;m not sure why the checkpoint would not work even with the SELF CRS. I&#39;ll have to check on that.<br>
<br>
Even though I used a simple counting program, the check point did not work.<br>
</blockquote>
<br></div>
Humm... Everything seems to be setup correctly, and the application is still behaving like it is not getting the &#39;-am ft-enable-cr&#39; parameter. The only other thing I can think of to try is to set this value in the $HOME/.openmpi/mca-params.conf file. It looks a bit different but if you add the following line it should work (as long as $HOME is mounted on all of the machines).<br>

<br>
So append this value to your $HOME/.openmpi/mca-params.conf file and see if that helps.<br>
#-----------------<br>
mca_base_param_file_prefix=ft-enable-cr<br>
#-----------------<br>
<br>
If that doesn&#39;t work, I&#39;ll have to think a bit more about what might be going wrong here.<br><font color="#888888">

 - Do you have any environment variables/MCA parameters set for Open MPI?<br>
  &gt;&gt; yes<br>
  $HOME/.openmpi/mca-params.conf<br>
  # Local snapshot directory (not used in this scenario)<br>
  crs_base_snapshot_dir=${HOME}/temp<br>

These all look fine to me.<br>

I connection with Josh&#39;s question about mpirun arguments, I suggest you try setting<br>
  MPIRUN_CMD=&#39;mpirun -am ft-enable-cr -np %N %P %A&#39;<br>
in your environment before launching the GASNet application.  This will instruct GASNet&#39;s wrapper around mpirun to include the flag Josh mentioned.<br>

I have not tried to use the checkpoint/restart feature with GASNet over MPI, so I cannot comment directly on how they interact. However, the combination should work as long as the proper arguments (-am ft-enable-cr) are passed along to the mpirun command, and Open MPI is configured properly.<br>

<br>
The error message that you copied seems to indicate that the local daemon on one of the nodes failed to start a checkpoint of the target application. Often this is caused by one of two things:<br>
 - Open MPI was not configured with the fault tolerance thread, and the application is waiting for a long time in a computation loop (not entering the MPI library).<br>
 - The &#39;-am ft-enable-cr&#39; flag was not provided to the mpirun process, so the MPI application did not activate the C/R specific code paths and is therefore denying the request to checkpoint.<br>
<br>
Can you send me a bit more information:<br>
 - What version of Open MPI are you using?<br>
 - How did you configure Open MPI?<br>
 - What arguments are being passed to &#39;mpirun&#39; when running with GASNet?<br>
 - Do you have any environment variables/MCA parameters set for Open MPI?<br>

Dear all.<br>
<br>
Thanks to developers of OPEN-MPI for Fault-Tolerance, I can use the checkpoint/restart function very well for my MPI applications.<br>
But its checkpoint does not work for my GASNet applications which use the MPI conduit.<br>
Is here anyone else to help me?<br>
I wrote some code with GASNet API (Global-Address Space Networking: <a href="http://gasnet.cs.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">http://gasnet.cs.berkeley.edu/</a>)    and used MPI conduit for my gasnet application, so my program ran well with open-mpirun. Thus I thought that I could also use the transparent checkpoint/restart function supported by BLCR in Open-mpi. As opposed to my idea, it does not work and show the following error message.<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Error: The process with PID 13896 is not checkpointable.<br>
     This could be due to one of the following:<br>
      - An application with this PID doesn&#39;t currently exist<br>
      - The application with this PID isn&#39;t checkpointable<br>
      - The application with this PID isn&#39;t an OPAL application.<br>
     We were looking for the named files:<br>
       /tmp/opal_cr_prog_write.13896<br>
       /tmp/opal_cr_prog_read.13896<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>

Thank you for your reading and have a great day.<br>
