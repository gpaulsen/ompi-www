As this is used in other places, I wanted to highlight it here since not everyone looks at the PRs in the “oven”.</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">The change was required because mca_component_select never actually looked at the returned status from a component query - it just blissfully ignored it. In this case, it caused us to ignore a user error and continue along to select another component, leading to behavior contrary to what the user had specified. The solution was to simply have the function check the returned status, and if it is OPAL_ERR_FATAL, then abort the procedure and return that error code.</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">You can see the details here:</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class=""><a href="https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/pull/936/files" class="">https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/pull/936/files</a></div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">Please let me know if this is going to cause a problem for your framework.
