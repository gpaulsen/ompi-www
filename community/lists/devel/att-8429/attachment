I should also have noted that:<div><br></div><div>1. all of the opal_ifxxx functions still have their &quot;no-op&quot; versions when struct sockaddr_in is not present. </div><div><br></div><div>2. we still &quot;lazy discover&quot; interfaces, so the new opal_if framework is -not- opened unless you call one of the opal_ifxxx functions and get a non-no-op version</div>
<div><br></div><div>So I believe RS will be protected, so long as it fails the &quot;have struct sockaddr_in&quot; test. I&#39;m pretty sure that is the protection used currently, so nothing should have changed in that regard.</div>

My Red Storm dev cluster isn&#39;t working right now, but I didn&#39;t see an option for no if support at all.  Did I miss it, or are we going to have to add it later?<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

&gt; Per a discussion on the devel telecon a week or two ago, I have refactored the opal/util/if.c code into a static framework (ala the installdirs implementation) so that the various cases are dealt with in configure.m4 instead of a mass of interwoven #if-#else clauses. Jeff will undoubtedly do some cleanup of the configury magic, but the basic functionality is ready for initial review.<br>


&gt;<br>
&gt; For those who care, please clone and check the code at <a href="http://bitbucket.org/rhc/ompi-if" target="_blank">http://bitbucket.org/rhc/ompi-if</a> to ensure that the correct opal/mca/if components are being built for your environment, and that the discovered interfaces are correct. Please let me know (up or down) so we can get a feel for how close we are to bringing this back to the trunk.<br>


&gt;<br>
&gt; Thanks<br>
