Ah - now that is easily fixed, without breaking the support for everyone else. I&#39;ll commit the fix right away.<br><br>Thanks<br>Ralph<br><br><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Mon, Jun 22, 2009 at 11:12 AM, Iain Bason <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:Iain.Bason@sun.com">Iain.Bason@sun.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br>

Yes, but look at orte/mca/plm/rsh/plm_rsh_module.c:<br>
<br>
       /* ensure that only the ssh plm is selected on the remote daemon */<br>
    var = mca_base_param_environ_variable(&quot;plm&quot;, NULL, NULL);<br>
    opal_setenv(var, &quot;rsh&quot;, true, &amp;env);<br>
    free(var);<br>
   This is done in &quot;ssh_child&quot;, right before we fork_exec the ssh command to launch the remote daemon. This is why slave spawn works, for example.<br>

My ssh does not preserve environment variables:<br>
<br>
bash-3.2$ export MY_VERY_OWN_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE=yes<br>
bash-3.2$ ssh cubbie env | grep MY_VERY_OWN<br>

bash-3.2$<br>
<br>
The rsh man page explicitly states that the local environment is not passed to the remote shell.<br>
<br>
I haven&#39;t checked qrsh.  Maybe it works with that.<div class="im"><br>

I agree that tree_spawn doesn&#39;t seem to work right now, but it is not due to the plm not being selected. <br>

It was for me.  I don&#39;t know whether it is because your rsh/ssh work differently, or for some other reason, but there is no question that my tree spawn failed because no PLM was loaded.<div class="im"><br>

There are other factors involved.<br>
</blockquote>
<br></div>
The other factors that I came across were:<br>
<br>
   * I didn&#39;t have my .ssh/config file set up to forward<br>
     authentication.  I added a -A flag to the ssh command in<br>
     plm_base_rsh_support.<br>
<br>
   * In plm_rsh_module.c:setup_launch, a NULL orted_cmd made asprintf<br>
     crash.  I used (orted_cmd == NULL ? &quot;&quot; : orted_cmd) in the call to<br>
     asprintf.<br>
<br>
<br>
Once I fixed those, tree spawning worked for me.  (I believe you mentioned a race condition in another conversation.  I haven&#39;t run into that.)<div><div></div><div class="h5"><br>
