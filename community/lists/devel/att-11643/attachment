However, when I read the source code of openmpi-1.6.2, I couldn't find any component named DR or TEG (which are mentioned in those papers and are supposed to support NIC failover and message stripping). So my question is:</div>
<div><br></div><div><b>Does the 1.6.2 release of Open MPI support such two kinds of&nbsp;functionalities? If positive, which part of code is corresponding to these functionalities?</b></div></blockquote><div><br></div><div>Lirong,</div><div><br></div><div>As you noticed the papers are quite old and dusty.</div><div><br></div><div>Due to a lack of interest from the community the DR PML has been retired from out stable releases. In other terms no stable Open MPI version supports network failover. However, the code is still available in the trunk, but there is no guarantee it still does what it was designed for.</div><div><br></div><div>TEG has been replaced with OB1, which is our current network management layer. It does stripping over multiple NICs (identical or not) by default.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; george.</div><br><blockquote type="cite"><div><br></div><div>Many thanks in advance.</div>
