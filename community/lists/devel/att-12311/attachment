<p dir="ltr">I talked to jeff a while ago and he set up a temp bitbucket for that. I submited some suggestions about the code there, so I&#39;m not sure about the revisio of the CMR. Anyway, this is my university mail, and I can also be reached at alexma at mellanox.com... I&#39;m on mike&#39;s team now.</p>

Sending this to devel because we lack a current address for Alex Margolin - can someone please review the Mosix support requested to transfer to v1.7 in CMR #3411? We need (a) to know the status of that code, (b) is it already in the trunk, and (c) a patch.<br>

<br>
If it isn&#39;t in the trunk, then let&#39;s kill the CMR, get it into the trunk, and then resubmit it once the changes have had a chance to &quot;soak&quot; for awhile.<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>
