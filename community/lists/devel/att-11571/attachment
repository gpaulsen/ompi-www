Use "mpirun" to launch a non-MPI program (e.g., hostname or uptime)<br>&gt;    across multiple nodes.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 2. Use "mpirun" to launch a trivial MPI program that does no MPI<br>&gt;    communication (e.g., the hello_c program in the examples/ directory<br>&gt;    in the Open MPI distribution).<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 3. Use "mpirun" to launch a trivial MPI program that sends and<br>&gt;    receives a few MPI messages (e.g., the ring_c program in the<br>&gt;    examples/ directory in the Open MPI distribution).<br>&gt; <br>&gt; If you can run all three of these tests successfully, that is a good<br>&gt; indication that Open MPI built and installed properly.<br>&gt; -----<br>&gt; <br>&gt; &gt; Also, it will be ok if I copy the openmpi-1.2.9  directory to the other nodes? The installation took like almost 3 hours.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Wow; configuration / compilation of Open MPI took *3 hours*?  I'm guessing you have very old / low-power processors, or very slow network filesystem access...?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; See this FAQ information on where to install OMPI:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;     http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=building#where-to-install<br>&gt; <br>&gt; &gt; I sent the "ccIVTymL.out" file to the forum but my mail is waiting for moderator approval.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; It likely won't be approved.  Send a smaller attachment, please, such as a compressed text file (see the support page, above).  :-)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; -- <br>&gt; Jeff Squyres<br>&gt; jsquyres@cisco.com<br>&gt; For corporate legal information go to: http://www.cisco.com/web/about/doing_business/legal/cri/<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; devel mailing list<br>&gt; devel@open-mpi.org<br>&gt; http://www.open-mpi.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/devel<br></div></div></div></div>
