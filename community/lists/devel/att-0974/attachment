Hi, <br><br>In the process of trying to create a wrapper for open mpi to another language.&nbsp; Specifically, I am trying to understand how the remote memory access/one-sided communication works in open mpi 1.1, and I am having some trouble.&nbsp; 
<br><br>I have begun by trying to trace the steps in a simple MPI_Get call.&nbsp; It seems that ompi_osc_pt2pt_replyreq_recv in ompi/mca/osc/pt2pt/osc_pt2pt_data_move.c is the function that receives the data for the requesting process, however I have not been able to find the part of the code that receives the request at the other end.&nbsp; It looks like ompi_osc_pt2pt_component_fragment_cb in osc_pt2pt_component.c sends the data back to the requesting process, but I can't see where the data is actually copied.&nbsp; 
<br><br>Can someone please point me in the right direction?&nbsp; Is there any documentation on the one-sided communication implementation that I should be reading?&nbsp; <br><br>Thanks, <br><br clear="all"><br>Rory. <br>-- <br><a href="mailto:gh.rory@gmail.com">
