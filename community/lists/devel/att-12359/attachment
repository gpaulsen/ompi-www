<div dir="ltr">Hello to @ll.<div><br></div><div>I&#39;m not sure if this is the correct list to post this question, but maybe i&#39;m dealing with a bug.</div><div><br></div><div>I have develop an event logging mechanism where application processes connect to event loggers (using MPI_Lookup, MPI_open_port, MPI_Comm_Connect, MPI_Comm_Accept, etc) that are part of another MPI application.</div>

<div><br></div><div>Well, i have develop my own vprotocol where once a process receive a message try to establish a connection with an event logger which is a thread that belongs to another mpi application. </div>
<div><br></div><div>The event logger application consists in one mpi process per node with multiple threads waiting for connections of MPI processes from the main application. </div><div><br></div><div>I&#39;m suspecting that there is a problem with the critical regions when processes try to connect with the threads of the event logger. </div>
<div><br></div><div style>I&#39;m attaching two short examples that i have written in order to show the problem. First, i launch the event-logger application:</div><div style><br></div><div style><br></div><div style><br>
</div><div style>If i use mutex in order to serialized the access to MPI_Comm_Accept,</div><div style><div><br></div></div>
