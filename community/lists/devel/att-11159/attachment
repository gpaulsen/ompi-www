        <pre wrap="">What does it mean that "all 3 verbs-based components must succeed"?  
Does that mean you cannot specify --with-verbs=DIR --with-openib --without-ofud?

      <pre wrap="">
Yes.  --with/without-ofud never worked, anyway (i.e., there was no code that implemented it).  Ditto that there was no --with/without-ud.

Yes.  Same was true for --with-openib=DIR.</pre>

    Hmmm, I guess I could see the thinking of tying ofud and openib btls
    configuring together.&nbsp; However it seems inconsistent to me that one
    btl doesn't allow you to control configuring it in or not directly.&nbsp;
    What if I really do not want to build ofud but do want to build
    openib?<br>
    <br>
    That being said it seems this happened some time ago so I guess I'll
    grin and bare it.<br>

You're probably thinking of hwloc; hwloc can *use* verbs, but it doesn't *require* verbs.  The other 3 (OOB UD, BTL OFUD, BTL openib) all *require* verbs and cannot be built without it.

    Ok, well I just asked because in the list above *you* mention 4
    verbs components in one of the items and I was just curious what
    that might me.<br>
