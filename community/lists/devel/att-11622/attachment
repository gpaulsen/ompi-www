I am trying to resolve an odd issue I am seeing with my one uGNI-based code, and was hoping to use OMPI&#39;s uGNI support as an example of correct usage.  My particular interest is in RDMA, but as far as I can tell the uGNI blt in ompi-trunk doesn&#39;t have the btl_put or blt_get entry points.  So, if I understand correctly, that means osc/pt2pt is used for MPI-RMA support on a Cray XE.  Is that correct?<div>
