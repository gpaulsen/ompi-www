<h3>Title: MPI Library and Low-Level Communication on the K computer</h3>

<h3>Author(s):</h3> Naoyuki Shida, Shinji Sumimoto, Atsuya Uno

<h3>Abstract:</h3>

<p>The key to raising application performance in a massively parallel system like the K computer is to increase the speed of communication between compute nodes. In the K computer, this inter-node communication is governed by the Message Passing Interface (MPI) communication library and low-level communication. This paper describes the implementation and performance of the MPI communication library, which exploits the new Tofu-interconnect architecture introduced in the K computer to enhance the performance of petascale applications, and low-level communication mechanism, which performs fine-grained control of the Tofu interconnect.</p>
