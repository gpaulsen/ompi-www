I would suggest going with a newer version as Gilles said, just so you start with something we can help you with (we don’t support something as old as 1.4.5).<div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">You can safely remove nearly all the components before building. There are a few frameworks that need to have at least one component - I’m afraid we don’t keep a list, so it may take a bit of experimenting to find the minimum set. If you want, you can drop a “.opal_ignore” file (can be empty) in the directory of a component you want to remove - might be an easier way to experiment. You’ll need to re-run autogen.pl and configure every time you add/remove an .opal_ignore.</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">You cannot remove entire frameworks without editing the rest of the code, so I wouldn’t start there.</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">HTH</div><div class="">Ralph</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class=""><br class=""><div><blockquote type="cite" class=""><div class="">On Mar 19, 2016, at 2:52 AM, Gilles Gouaillardet &lt;<a href="mailto:gilles.gouaillardet@gmail.com" class="">gilles.gouaillardet@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:</div><br class="Apple-interchange-newline"><div class="">Monika,<div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">is there ant reason why you use openmpi 1.4.5 &nbsp;?</div><div class="">it is quite antique today, 1.10.2 is the latest stable version.</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">strictly speaking, openmpi does not require linux, it works fine on Solaris, bsd variants, Cygwin and other arch.</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">the memory footprint is made of the library size, and the memory it allocates internally</div><div class="">(buffers for communication for example)</div><div class="">at first glance, I am not sure you should start focusing on the library&nbsp;size.</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">I'd rather suggest you start with openmpi 1.10.2, and then try</div><div class="">configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">if you are stuck, then please post the details so we are able to help</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">Cheers,</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">Gilles</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class=""><br class=""><div class=""><div class=""><br class="">On Saturday, March 19, 2016, Monika Hemnani &lt;<a href="mailto:hemnanimt1@rknec.edu" class="">hemnanimt1@rknec.edu</a>&gt; wrote:<br class=""><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex"><div dir="ltr" class=""><div class=""><div class=""><div class=""><div class=""><div class="">I am building a multiprocessor system with soft-core processor(Microblaze) and operating system xilkernel(OS from xilinx).
