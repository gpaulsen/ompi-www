Hi Rayson<br><br>We take snapshots from time to time. We debated whether or not to update again for the 1.7 release, but ultimately decided not to do so - IIRC, none of our developers had the time.<br><br>If you are interested and willing to do the update, and perhaps look at removing the limit, that is fine with me! You might check to see if the latest ROMIO can go past 2GB - could be that an update is all that is required.<br>
<br>Alternatively, you might check with Edgar Gabriel about the ompio component and see if it either supports &gt; 2GB sizes or can also be extended to do so. Might be that a simple change to select that module instead of ROMIO would meet the need.<br>
<br>Appreciate your interest in contributing!<br>Ralph<br><br><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Tue, Nov 6, 2012 at 11:55 AM, Rayson Ho <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:raysonlogin@gmail.com" target="_blank">raysonlogin@gmail.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br>

I would like to fix the 2GB limit in the ROMIO code... and that&#39;s why<br>
I am asking! :-D<br>

&gt; Hi Rayson,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Just seen this.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; In the end we&#39;ve worked around it, by creating successive views of the file<br>
&gt; that are all else than 2GB and then offsetting them to eventually read in<br>
&gt; everything. It&#39;s a bit of a pain to keep track of, but it works at the<br>
&gt; moment.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I was intending on following your hints and trying to fix the bug myself,<br>
&gt; but I&#39;ve been short on time so haven&#39;t gotten around to it yet.<br>

&gt; Hi Eric,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Sounds like it&#39;s also related to this problem reported by Scinet back in<br>
&gt; July:<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; And I think I found the issue, but I still have not followed up with<br>
&gt; the ROMIO guys yet. And I was not sure if Scinet was waiting for the<br>
&gt; fix or not - next time I visit U of Toronto, I will see if I can visit<br>
&gt; the Scinet office and meet with the Scinet guys!<br>
