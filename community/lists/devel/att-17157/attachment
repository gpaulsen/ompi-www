<div dir="ltr">Hi everyone,<div>I&#39;m an italian M.Sc. student in Computer Engineering at Politecnico di Milano.Â </div><div><br></div><div>My team and I are trying to integrate OpenMPI with a real time resource manager written by a group of students named BBQ ( <a href="http://bosp.dei.polimi.it/">http://bosp.dei.polimi.it/</a> ). We are encountering some troubles, though.</div><div><br></div><div>Our main issue is to understand how ORTE interacts with the resource manager, which parts of the code (if any) are executed on the &quot;slave&quot; nodes and which ones on the &quot;master&quot;.</div><div>We spent some time looking at the source code but we still have many doubts.</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you.</div></div>
