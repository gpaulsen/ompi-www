<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So basically to achieve the same goal the change moved from a fictitious email address to our real one. I agree with you that both the old and the new way allows one to know exactly who was the committer. But as you highlighted in your email, the commit messages are intended for a well informed audience, people who know who did the commit based on the snv_id.

<p>Here is my guess: he's working on his PhD at Huston under Edgar's supervision. My point is that if one doesn't know who is behind an svn_id, it is not by having his email address that the lack of knowledge get resolved.
<br>
<p>The git and hg stuff export an email address I choose locally, so there is nothing to compare with the situation here. Your argument basically states that if they doesn't show you they have it, then it is OK. My argument, is that it is not a voluntary action each one of us choose to do, disclosing personal information should not happen.
<br>
<p>We can argue this back and forth for days, meanwhile I will take the required steps to fix the situation on my end.

<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Btw, the commit emails __are__ archived on the web, they appear on ohloh, cia.vc and so on. I would be careful on what information we disclose on them.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; I thought they only archived the *SVN commit messages* -- which are quite different than the emails that we sent out.  The SVN commit messages only contain the SVN username, not any of the extra stuff that we put in the emails.  E.g.:

<span class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;    <a href="http://cia.vc/stats/project/OMPI">http://cia.vc/stats/project/OMPI</a>
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; Can you show an example of someone web archiving our commit emails?
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; Let's also not forget that hg and git include email addresses in the commit messages.  So it's a pretty common practice.  The world already knows your email address, George.  :-)
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; Don't get me wrong -- if you hate this, I will take it out.  But I do want to clearly enunciate what this *is* and *is not* before making a decision to take it out (that may have been formed based on incorrect information/assumptions).
