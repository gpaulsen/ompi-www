Hi,
<br>
<p>I'm not sure if anyone remembers, but I was working on Open MPI support 
<br>
for MOSIX in the form of several MCA modules (turned out to be BTL, 
<br>
ODLS, and RAS). It's pretty much finished now, thanks to your help (I 
<br>
got many useful tips and clarifications from this mailing list). As I 
<br>
said before, I would like to contribute it to the Open MPI trunk so 
<br>
anyone can use it. I'll keep maintaining it for the near future, and 
<br>
maybe other students (most likely from my lab) will continue my work and 
<br>
add more features.
<br>
As for the formalities - My advisor (I'm a grad student) sent a signed 
<br>
contributor form, but we didn't get any reply... Anyway, the IP stuff 
<br>
aren't an issue.
<br>
I'm not sure to who'm do I speak for SVN write-access, so attached is 
<br>
the patch for the current trunk.
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Alex
