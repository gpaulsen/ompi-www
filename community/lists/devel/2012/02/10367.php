<p>Ah, gotcha.
<br>
<p>That doesn't seem too attractive from an OMPI perspective, though.  We'd want to know where the PCI devices are actually rooted.
<br>
<p>Another reason OMPI wants the whole system: be able to tell the memory characteristics of other processes on the same server as me (e.g., be able to tell that it's on a different numa node, socket, ...etc.).
