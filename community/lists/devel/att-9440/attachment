<br><tt><font size=2>Congratulations for your machine, this is a stunning
achievement !</font></tt>

<br><tt><font size=2>&gt; Also, we modified tuned COLL to implement interconnect-and-topology-<br>
&gt; specific bcast/allgather/alltoall/allreduce algorithm. These algorithm<br>
&gt; implementations also bypass PML/BML/BTL to eliminate protocol and
software<br>
&gt; overhead.</font></tt>
<br><tt><font size=2>This seems perfectly valid to me. The current coll
components use normal MPI_Send/Recv semantics, hence the PML/BML/BTL chain,
but I always saw the coll framework as a way to be able to integrate smoothly
&quot;custom&quot; collective components for a specific interconnect. I
think that Mellanox also did a specific collective component using directly
their ConnectX HCA capabilities.</font></tt>
<br>
<br><tt><font size=2>However, modifying the &quot;tuned&quot; component
may not be the better way to integrate your collective work. You may consider
creating a &quot;tofu&quot; coll component which would only provide the
collectives you optimized (and the coll framework will fallback on tuned
for the ones you didn't optimize).</font></tt>
<br><tt><font size=2><br>
&gt; To achieve above, we created 'tofu COMMON', like sm (ompi/mca/common/sm/).<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Is there interesting one?</font></tt>
<br><tt><font size=2>It may be interesting, yes. I don't know the tofu
model, but if it is not secret, contributing it is usually a good thing.</font></tt>
<br>
<br><tt><font size=2>Your communication model may be similar to others
and portions of code may be shared with other technologies (I'm thinking
of IB, MX, PSM,...). People writing new code would also consider your model
and let you take advantage of it. Knowing how tofu is integrated into Open
MPI may also impact major decisions the open-source community is taking.</font></tt>
