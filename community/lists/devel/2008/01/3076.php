<p>
I just wanted to give a public &quot;thank you!&quot; to the Absoft Corporation  
<br>
(the fortran compiler company): Absoft is the first organization who  
<br>
is not a core member of the Open MPI project to run automated Open MPI  
<br>
regression testing and submit the results back to our centralized  
<br>
testing database.  Absoft is testing both stable and development  
<br>
snapshots of Open MPI with their compiler suite on several different  
<br>
platforms and operating systems.
<br>
<p>MPI testing is not a core concern for a compiler company, but since  
<br>
Absoft products tend to be used in HPC environments, it benefits us  
<br>
all to ensure that Open MPI works properly with their products.  Not  
<br>
only does Absoft's testing give us early warning when we  
<br>
unintentionally break something in their environments, Absoft is  
<br>
actually testing some platforms that we were not already regularly  
<br>
testing (e.g., several flavors of OS X).
<br>
<p>I would personally love to see similar collaborations with other  
<br>
compiler vendors.
<br>
<p>Many thanks, Absoft!
<br>
