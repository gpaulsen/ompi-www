<p>I'm checking on whether there are Telepresence rooms in Tennessee.   
<br>
FWIW, I don't think there are any in ABQ yet.
<br>
<p>Also, keep in mind that I can usually only get mainstream Cisco  
<br>
Telepresence rooms for 1-2 hours at a time.  Boxborough is a  
<br>
&quot;mainstream&quot; Cisco office (read: a big office with lots of people who  
<br>
use Telepresence).  Louisville is small and relatively easy to  
<br>
schedule Telepresence time.
<br>
<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps we should discuss this at the Tues telecon? Might go faster  
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; there. Anyone who isn't going to be on that telecon should please

<span class="quotelev1">&gt; speak up on this email thread ASAP.
</span><br>
<p>That sounds good.  Let's talk next Tuesday - right after we release  
<br>
v1.3!!  :-)
