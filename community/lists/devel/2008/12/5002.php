<p>
I don't know who's interested, so I thought I'd bring it up on the  
<br>
devel list: let's start the basics for the January ORTE meeting.  We  
<br>
may be able to sketch out an agenda, but frankly, it may depend on how  
<br>
far we get in the December meeting.  So we may not be able to fully  
<br>
decide that yet.
<br>
<p>But I thought we might be able to list out the high level goals and  
<br>
start discussing location, length of the meeting, and dates.
<br>
<p>* Cisco has some heavy travel restrictions right now, so I would not  
<br>
be able to attend unless we have it here in Louisville again, or  
<br>
perhaps Bloomington (i.e., I can make day trips to drive there).  I do  
<br>
have a Telepresence unit in Louisville now, so we could conference in  
<br>
Boxborough (i.e., Sun) for 1-2 hours at a time, if desirable.  That  
<br>
being said, my presence is probably not critical to these meetings, so  
<br>
don't let this be a gating factor.
<br>
<p>* My January is fairly open at this point; I have no scheduled travel  
<br>
[yet].  I *may* become unavailable the week of Jan 5 (i.e., first full  
<br>
week in Jan), which might not be desirable for an ORTE meeting anyway  
<br>
because a) we'll all be recovering from the holidays, and b) it's  
<br>
unlikely that anyone will have had a chance to do much/anything since  
<br>
the December ORTE meeting.
<br>
<p>* Point of information: the next Forum meeting is in the California  
<br>
Bay area on Feb 9-11, 2009.
