<p>
A month or two ago, I gave the LANL guys an overview of IU's goals with 
<br>
respect to OMPI.  There were several &quot;Ohhh!  So *that's* why you guys 
<br>
were asking for X, Y, and Z...&quot; from the LANL guys during my 
<br>
presentation.  As such, I think it was really helpful for everyone to 
<br>
understand our motivations.
<br>
<p>It's not that we were previously hiding them -- we just never got 
<br>
around to explicitly sharing them.
<br>
<p>I think we should have similar presentations at the upcoming meeting.  
<br>
Can someone from each core organization (LANL, IU, UTK, HLRS) give a 
<br>
10-15 minute presentation (or whatever) listing all your goals and 
<br>
ambitions with OMPI?  Separate them into short- and long-term goals, if 
<br>
possible.
<br>
<p>For example, I'll talk about IU's MPI-2 one-sided efforts, our plans 
<br>
for PBS and SLURM, and our future efforts for fault 
<br>
tolerance/checkpoint restart.
<br>
<p>Thanks!
