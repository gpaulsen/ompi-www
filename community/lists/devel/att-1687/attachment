<br>while but had never gotten around to looking into (I could have sworn<br>that there was an open trac ticket on this, but I can&#39;t find one<br>anywhere).<br><br>I have 2 hosts: one with 3 active ports and one with 2 active ports.
<br>If I run an MPI job between them, the openib BTL wireup got badly and<br>it aborts.&nbsp;&nbsp;So handling a heterogeneous number of ports is not<br>currently handled properly in the code.<br><br>I don&#39;t know if Gleb&#39;s patch addresses this situation or not; I&#39;ll
<br>look at his patch this afternoon.<br><br></blockquote></div><br><br>There is a ticket (closed) here: <a href="https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/ticket/548">https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/ticket/548</a><br>It was fixed by Galen for 
1.2. There is a FAQ entry also about this&nbsp; <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=openfabrics#ofa-port-wireup">http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=openfabrics#ofa-port-wireup</a><br>
