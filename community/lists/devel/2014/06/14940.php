To whom may interest,
<br>
<p>My name is Manuel Rodr&#195;&#173;guez. I am a postdoc worker in CIEMAT, the
<br>
Spanish leading research centre for Energy, Environment and
<br>
Technology. This mail is devoted to inform you about a possible
<br>
funded stay at your institution.
<br>
<p>I have been offered a research grant, fully founded by the Spanish
<br>
ministry of Science, to spend between three and six  months in any
<br>
research centre around the world, all costs covered. It is mainly
<br>
devoted to two objectives: acquire expertise from that centre, and
<br>
encourage stablish a long-lasting collaboration.
<br>
<p>At this moment, we are just starting a research project oriented to
<br>
Exascale computing, trying to achieve dynamic, robust and efficient
<br>
clusters. Among the necessary pieces, developments on OpenMPI will be
<br>
necessary.  My intention is then to spend some time with one of the
<br>
development teams. This way, it would be easier for me to learn the
<br>
insights of the application and start contributing on its development.
<br>
For that reason I am sending this mail to the development mailing
<br>
list.
<br>
<p>On the other side, the your institution obtains several benefits from
<br>
my presence: a boost on the development of the application, a valuable
<br>
point of view from my expertise -I am a PhD in distributed systems-,
<br>
the start of a relationship with a research centre deeply involved in
<br>
the Spanish and European scientific community and, kind of said, a
<br>
highly skilled worker 'for free'.
<br>
<p>If you think this proposal can be interesting to you, please contact
<br>
me. And of course, feel free to forward this mail to anybody you think
<br>
that can be interested.
<br>
<p>Thanks for your attention. Best regards,
<br>
<p>Manuel
