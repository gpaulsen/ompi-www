Well, as I said, I'm not a lawyer and I'm not about to argue legal issues with you :-)
<br>
<p>All I can do is reiterate that the lawyers involved (a) felt that this was required as a gateway to providing commit permissions to our repository, (b) that it was separate from the license itself, and (c) that everything was fully compatible. It's been reviewed and ratified by additional legal teams over the years as other contributing corporations and organizations have joined.
<br>
<p>You are welcome to contact the legal departments of the contributing organizations (as shown on our web site) to request a legal explanation.
