<p>Note that the chart I included in the email is pulled directly from the AUTHORS file.  So if things have changed, people should update their entries in AUTHORS.
<br>
<p>We keep a FULL list of people who have *ever* committed in AUTHORS; we never trim it.
<br>
<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt; Looking at your lists, it is full of people who haven't been involved with OMPI for many years. So I'd say you should remove everyone on your &quot;no commits in last year&quot; list who doesn't respond and/or have someone from an active member org specifically request they be retained.
</span><br>
<p>I'm guessing all of those will drop off, too.
<br>
<p>I did a quick check and I think that (almost) everyone who hasn't had a commit in the last year isn't on the wiki page to be classified (some exceptions include the IU staff who have admin rights over the repo, etc.).
<br>
<p>Regardless, I think those who have drifted away from the project won't update the wiki, and we'll end up deleting their accounts next week.  If a mistake is made, it's easy/trivial to restore an SVN account.
