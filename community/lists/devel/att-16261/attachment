<br>
We seem to be creating a bunch of pull requests on the trunk (well, by “we” I mean mostly Gilles) that are then being left hanging there, going stale. Some of these are going to start conflicting with changes being made by others, or even conflict with each other.<br>
<br>
Can we do a “purge” of them? It looks like they are being posted, reviewed, approved….and then just sit there. Are people expecting someone else to do the final merge? If so, who?<br>
