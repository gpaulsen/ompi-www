<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">Hello,</font>
<br>
<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">I have a proprietary transport/messaging
layer that sits below an MTL component. This transport layer requires OpenMPI
to assign it a rank that is unique and specific to that process and will
not change from execution to termination. In a way, I am trying to find
a one-one correspondence between a process's universal rank in OpenMPI
and this transport layer. I began looking at ompi_proc_t from different
processes and seemingly found a unique identifier, proc_name.vpid. Consequently,
I assigned the ranks to each process in my transport layer based on the
value of the local vpid of each process.</font>
<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">I have not tested this thoroughly, but
it has been working so far. Although, I would like to make sure that this
is a good approach, or know, at least, whether if there are other ways
to do this. I would appreciate it if you could leave me feedback or give
suggestions on how to assign universal ranks to a proprietary transport
software.</font>
<br>
<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">Thanks for your help,</font>
