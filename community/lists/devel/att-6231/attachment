But i have not been able to get hold of profiling data. I tried installing vampir from <a target="_blank" href="https://computing.llnl.gov/code/vgv.html#installations">https://computing.llnl.gov/code/vgv.html#installations</a> but i am not been able to install. </span><br><br>So i wanted to know how people are profiling the core openMPI code. <br><br>I am a complete newbie and would appreciate any information. <br><br>Also i was wondering
 whether gdb could be used with openMPI. I know about -d option in mpirun but i need to use gdb if its possible. I think i have done all the necessary things to enable profiling and debuging but i am missing something here. <br><br>Currentl y i am configuring openMPI using following param<br>&nbsp;./configure -enable-debug --with-devel-headers --enable-trace --enable-mpi-profile --enable-mem-debug <br><br><br>Leo P.<br></div><br>
