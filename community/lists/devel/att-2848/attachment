<FONT FACE="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><SPAN STYLE='font-size:12.0px'>Yes, should be a bit more clear. &nbsp;Need an independent way to verify that data is matched<BR>

&nbsp;sending unique data in every message, and making sure that it arrives in the user buffers<BR>

&gt;&gt;&gt; This is better than nothing, but really not very helpful for <BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt; looking at the<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt; specific issues that can arise with this, unless these systems <BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt; have several<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt; parallel networks, with tests that will generate a lot of parallel <BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt; network<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt; traffic, and be able to self check for out-of-order received - <BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt; i.e. this<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt; needs to be encoded into the payload for verification purposes. &nbsp;<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt; There are<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt; some out-of-order scenarios that need to be generated and <BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt; checked. &nbsp;I think<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt; that George may have a system that will be good for this sort of <BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt; testing.<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>
&gt;&gt; I am running various test with multiple networks right now. I use<BR>
&gt;&gt; several IB BTLs and TCP BTL simultaneously. I see many reordered<BR>
&gt;&gt; messages and all tests were OK till now, but they don't encode<BR>
&gt;&gt; message sequence in a payload as far as I know. I'll change one of<BR>
&gt;&gt; them to do so.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Other than Rich's comment that we need sequence numbers, why add <BR>
&gt; them? &nbsp;We<BR>
&gt; haven't had them for non-matching packets for the last 3 years in <BR>
&gt; Open MPI<BR>
&gt; (ie, forever), and I can't see why we would need them. &nbsp;Yes, we need<BR>
&gt; sequence numbers for match headers to make sure MPI ordering is <BR>
&gt; correct.<BR>
&gt; But for the rest of the payload, there's no need with OMPI's datatype<BR>
&gt; engine. &nbsp;It's just more payload for no gain.<BR>
