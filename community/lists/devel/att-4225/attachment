All:<br><br>The trunk is now ready to be branched for the 1.3 release.&nbsp; Jeff has volunteered to do the branch in his copious spare time (thanks Jeff!).&nbsp; So, I expect that to happen either this evening or sometime tomorrow.<br>
<br>There are numerous tickets to resolve to get 1.3 ready for release.&nbsp; So, for the time being (i.e., the next 2-4 weeks) we will not be formally managing updates to the 1.3 branch.&nbsp; However, please relate all checkins to one or more tickets.&nbsp; Also, please ensure that large changes get reviewed before checking in.<br>
<br>Thanks,<br>--brad<br><br>
