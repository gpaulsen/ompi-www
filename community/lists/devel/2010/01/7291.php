You may have noticed that some of the messages from this morning were marked as a virus (prefixed with [PMX:VIRUS]). This was caused by the problem described below by Rob. This affected the various mailing lists (including all the Open MPI project lists) that were hosted by IU.
<br>
<p>The admins at IU think they have the issue resolved, and should be resending the quarantined messages sometime today.

</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; There was a problem with the CS virus and spam scanning software that
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; was causing email sent through @cs.indiana.edu, @extreme.indiana.edu,
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; and @osl.iu.edu to be incorrectly tagged as a virus with the virus code:
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; 	SOPHOS_SAVI_ERROR_OLD_VIRUS_DATA
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; We have corrected the underlying problem that caused this but the result
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; was that email delivered starting around 1:20am through around 8:25am on
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; 1/8/2010 was not delivered properly.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; The messages were saved in the software's quarantine queue and I will be
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; releasing this email from the queue so you should be receiving the
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; original messages intact.  I'm working with the vendor on the release of
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; the messages from the queue so you should be getting them shortly but I
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; don't have an ETA on this yet.  But, I'm working to do this as soon as
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; possible so please bear with me.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; Thanks,
