I think this is a good idea, and for the reasons you outline in your Rationale.&nbsp; This definitely bites people from time to time at Big Blue as well, and a gentle warning will certainly help.<br><br>--brad<br><br><br><div class="gmail_quote">

Those who care about the openib BTL:<br>
<br>
What do you think about warning when fork() is used with the openib BTL? &nbsp;See <a href="https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/ticket/1244" target="_blank">https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/ticket/1244</a> for details.<br>
<br>
Rationale: Several Cisco customers have been bitten by not realizing that they had calls to system() in their MPI codes when switching away from older mVAPI-based stacks to OFED (the older Cisco/Topspin mVAPI stack was a bit more tolerable of fork()). &nbsp;Newer kernels and OFED versions can handle fork() better, but I&#39;ve still had spurious reports of MPI codes failing when system() was used (never had much chance to followup to see what was actually happening, though -- it *should* have worked...?).<br>
