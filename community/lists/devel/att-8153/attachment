Hi,<br>
<br>
We've recently installed OpenMPI on one of our Cray XT5 machines, here
at CSCS. This machine uses SLURM for launching jobs.<br>
Doing an salloc defines this environment variable:<big><br>
</big><small><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><big>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BASIL_RESERVATION_ID<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reservation ID on Cray systems running ALPS/BASIL
only.</big><br>
</font></small><br>
Since the alps ras module tries to find a variable called
OMPI_ALPS_RESID which is set using a script, we thought that for SLURM
systems it would be a good idea to directly integrate this
BASIL_RESERVATION_ID variable in the code, rather than using a script.
The small patch is attached.<br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
<br>
