Hi Brian, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I found the problem. It looks like xgrid need
to do more work on fault tolerance. It seems that xgrid controller
distributed jobs to each available agent only in certain fixed order,
if one of the agents has problem in communicating with the controller,
all jobs failed, even when there are still more available agents. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my case, the third node that the
controller always contacted is node6, which has problem to reach it (I
found the problem when I try to do remote desktop to check each node, I
could not reach that node properly, the rest of other nodes are fine).
After I turn of the agent on node6, the previous problem was solved,
everything works fine.<br>
<br>
Thank you .<br>
