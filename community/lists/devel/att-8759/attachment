Hi Jeff ,Ralph and all,<br>            It is a good news that just before , I compare the performance of the VxWorks edition OPEN MPI and Linux edition OPEN MPI with Intel MPI benchmark. The result is not bad. In the PingPong test ,Whatever the latency and the bandwidth ,VxWorks edition behave as well as the Linux edition. Some code still need to be reconstructed ,but I think it is not a big problem for this edition. <br>
            I wish someday ,the VxWorks edition can be combined into the community.<br>Jing Zhang
