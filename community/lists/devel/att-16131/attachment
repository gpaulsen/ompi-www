<br>
I&#39;m reporting a performance (message rate 16%, latency 3%) regression when using PSM that occurred between OMPI v1.6.5 and v1.8.1.  I would guess it affects other networks too, but I haven&#39;t tested.  The problem stems from the --enable-smp-locks and --enable-opal-multi-threads options.<br>
<br>
--enable-smp-locks defaults to enabled and, on x86, causes a &#39;lock&#39; prefix to be prepended to ASM instructions used by atomic primitives.  Disabling removes the &#39;lock&#39; prefix.<br>
<br>
In OMPI 1.6.5, --enable-opal-multi-threads defaulted to disabled.  When enabled, OPAL would be compiled with multithreading support, which included compiling in calls to atomic primitives.  Those atomic primitives, in turn, potentially use a lock prefix (controlled by --enable-smp-locks).<br>
<br>
SVN r29891 on the trunk changed the above.  --enable-opal-multi-threads was removed.  CPP macros (#if OPAL_ENABLE_MULTI_THREADS) controlling various calls to atomic primitives were removed, effectively changing the default behavior to multithreading ON for OPAL.  This change was then carried to the v1.7 branch in r29944, Fixes #3983.<br>
<br>
We can use --disable-smp-locks to make the performance regression go away for the builds we ship, but we&#39;d very much prefer if performance was good &#39;out of the box&#39; for people that grab an OMPI tarball and use it with PSM.<br>
<br>
My question is, what&#39;s the best way to do that?  It seems obvious to just make --disable-smp-locks the default, but I presume the change was done on purpose, so I&#39;m looking for community feedback.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
<br>
Andrew<br>
