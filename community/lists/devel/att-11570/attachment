Hi folks<br><br>Jeff has posted the first release candidate for the 1.7.0 release in the usual place:<br><br><a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v1.7/">http://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v1.7/</a><br><br>Please put it thru the wringer to help us validate it prior to release later this month. We will update the NEWS section later to record the various new features relative to the 1.6 series - there are quite a few that built up over the last year or so.<br>
<br>Thanks<br>Ralph<br><br>
