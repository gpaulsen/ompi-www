&gt; These mailing lists are public, and their archives can be found online. While I do appreciate the fact that they asked, I don&#39;t see how we can prevent the KState researchers from using them.<br>

Agreed.  It&#39;s true; I am making a minor distinction between them screen-scraping the data from our public web pages vs. us handing them mbox files with the raw email content.  I don&#39;t think I have any problem with this, either -- I just wanted to make sure no one else in the community had an issue with it before I handed over the files.<br>
<br>
If no one else says anything by the call on Tuesday, I&#39;ll send them the mbox files.<br>
