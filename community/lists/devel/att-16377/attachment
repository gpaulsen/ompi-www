      i am not aware of any mpi implementation in which mpirun does the
      job allocation.<br>
      <br>
      instead, mpirun gets job info from the batch manager (e.g. number
      of nodes)<br>
      so the job can be launched seamlessly and be properly killed in
      case of a job abort<br>
      (bkill or equivalent)<br>

HI,

 sorry for the late reply - I've been traveling with limited email
access. I think you can leave this issue be. I think I was hoping for a
way to just launch mpirun and have it create the allocation by itself.
It's not super important right now, more something I was wondering
about. 

 Thanks again for looking into this!

 /Marc

Here's what I can provide: 

* lsrun -n N bash This causes openlava to create an allocation and start you off in a bash shell (or pick your shell) 

* mpirun ..... Will read the allocation and use openlava to start the daemons, and then the application, on the allocated nodes 

You can execute as many mpirun's as you like, then release the allocation (I believe by simply exiting the shell) when done. 

Does that match your expectations?

Hi,

yes, lsrun exists under openlava. 

Using mpirun is fine, but openlava currently requires that to be launched through a bash script (openmpi-mpirun). Would be neater if one could do away with that. 

Agan, thanks for looking into this!

/Marc

Hold on - was discussing this with a (possibly former) OpenLava developer who made some suggestions that would make this work. It all hinges on one thing. 

Can you please check and see if you have "lsrun" on your system? If you do, then I can offer a tight integration in that we would use OpenLava to actually launch the OMPI daemons. Still not sure I could support you directly launching MPI apps without using mpirun, if that's what you are after.

Hi Ralph,

I really appreciate you guys looking into this! At least now I know that there isn't a better way to run mpi jobs. Probably worth looking into LSF again..

Cheers,

Marc 
I took a brief gander at the OpenLava source code, and a couple of things jump out. First, OpenLava is a batch scheduler and only supports batch execution - there is no interactive command for "run this job". So you would have to "bsub" mpirun regardless. 

Once you submit the job, mpirun can certainly read the local allocation via the environment. However, we cannot use the OpenLava internal functions to launch the daemons or processes as the code is GPL2, and thus has a viral incompatible license. Ordinarily, we get around that by just executing the interactive job execution command, but OpenLava doesn't have one. 

So we'd have no other choice but to use ssh to launch the daemons on the remote nodes. This is exactly what the provided openmpi wrapper script that comes with OpenLava already does. 

Bottom line: I don't see a way to do any deeper integration minus the interactive execution command. If OpenLava had a way of getting an allocation and then interactively running jobs, we could support what you requested. This doesn't seem to be what they are intending, unless I'm missing something (the documentation is rather incomplete).

Hi, 

sure, no problem. And about the C Api, I really don't know more than what I was told in the google group post I referred to (i.e. the API is essentially identical to LSF 4-6, which should be on the web).

If you could just run a single copy of "env" and send the output along, that would help a lot. I'm not interested in the usual path etc, but would like to see the envars that OpenLava is setting.

Marc,

the reply you pointed is a bit confusing to me :

"There is a native C API which can submit/start/stop/kill/re queue jobs"
this is not what i am looking for :-(

"you need to make an appropriate call to openlava to start a remote process"
this is what i am interested in :-)
could you be more specific (e.g. point me to the functions, since the OpenLava doc is pretty minimal ...)

the goal here is to spawn the orted daemons as part of the parallel job,
so these daemons are accounted within the parallel job.
/* if we use an API that simply spawns orted, but the orted is not related whatsoever to the parallel job,
then we can simply use ssh */

Cheers,

Gilles

Hi Marc,

OpenLava is based on a pretty old version of LSF (4.x if i remember
correctly)
and i do not think LSF had support for parallel jobs tight integration
at that time.

my understanding is that basically, there is two kind of direct
integration :
- mpirun launch: mpirun spawns orted via the API provided by the batch
manager
- direct launch: the mpi tasks are launched directly from the
script/command line and no mpirun/orted is involved
at that time, it works with SLURM and possibly other PMI capable batch
manager

i think OpenLava simply gets a list of hosts from the environment, build
a machinefile, pass it to mpirun that spawns orted with ssh, so this is
really loose integration.

OpenMPI is based on plugins, so as long as the queing system provides an
API to start/stop/kill tasks, mpirun launch should not
be a huge effort.

Are you aware of such an API provided by OpenLava ?

Cheers,

Gilles

Hi list,

I have recently started to wonder how hard it would be to add support for queuing systems to the tight integration function of OpenMPI (unfortunately, I am not a developer myself). Specifically, we are working with OpenLava (<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.openlava.org">www.openlava.org</a> [2]), which is based on an early version of Lava/LSF and open source. It's proven quite useful in environments where some level of LSF compatibility is needed, but without actually paying for a (rather pricey) LSF license. 

Given that openLava shares quite a bit of DNA with LSF, I was wondering how hard it would be to add OL tight integration support to OpenMPI. Currently, OL enables OpenMPI jobs through a wrapper script, but that's obviously not ideal and doesn't work for some programs that have MPI support built-in (and thus expect to be able to just execute mpirun). 

Any thoughts on this would be greatly appreciated!

Regards,

Marc
