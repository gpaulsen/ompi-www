We are running it with 1.3.2, last I heard - haven&#39;t tried the current 1.3 branch. Ashley reported a problem with some other symbol that couldn&#39;t be loaded that blocked him on message queue debugging, but that was on the trunk.<br>
<br>Sounds like we are missing at least a couple of header files.<br><br><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Fri, May 15, 2009 at 7:37 AM, Terry Dontje <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:Terry.Dontje@sun.com">Terry.Dontje@sun.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br>
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;">Has anyone tried to run totalview with OMPI 1.3 on a RH5 linux system.  I am seeing totalview unable to load libompi_dbg_msgq.so because ompi_free_list_grow is not found.  What&#39;s interesting is this same symbol is undefined for Solaris but things work.  Is ompi_free_list_grow actually used by libompi_dbg_msgq.so or is it some how pulled in as a side affect of including an ompi header file.<br>

<br>
Anyways, I am curious if anyone else is seeing this same issue or if I am building OMPI in a way that is causing this problem?<br>
