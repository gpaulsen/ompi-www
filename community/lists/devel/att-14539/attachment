<div dir="ltr"><div><div><div><div><div>Personally: svn and Mercurial<br><br></div>Intel uses git. However, we have had significant trouble keeping git repos alive and clean in projects involving many developers that are geographically dispersed. As a result, we&#39;ve had to dedicate resources - full-time people whose sole job is to maintain the git repos as it requires someone with very high git knowledge to continually fix the problems. This doesn&#39;t require one person/project, but it does require (a) significant time, and (b) deep git knowledge.<br>
<br></div>The basic issue I&#39;m hearing is the same we have surfaced before: git exposes a lot of atomistic controls. This makes it very powerful, but also very easy to make an error as it requires a high level of git-knowledge to properly operate the system. Many developers lack that degree of &quot;git IQ&quot;, and don&#39;t take the time to learn it as they are under pressure to produce actual code, or think they have it but don&#39;t know as much as they think. As a result, the repo (main or the developer&#39;s branches) get confused and need to be corrected.<br>
<br></div>Bottom line: so long as OMPI has at least one git-expert on the team who can dedicate some of their time to helping developers &quot;fix&quot; their repo problems, the proposed transition could be done. I&#39;m not talking about someone who will monitor/repair the main repo - I&#39;m talking about someone also willing to assist every member of the devel team when that person&#39;s git branch gets hosed. If we ever lose that dedicated support, we may be in trouble.<br>
<br></div>Unlike a corporation, we can&#39;t hire someone to fill this role. We rely on contributed time from our members. So I think the question boils down to: do we have that kind of commitment from our member organizations for the foreseeable future? And should we adopt a technology that depends on that contribution?<br>

- SVN<br>
- Mercurial<br>
- Git<br>
<br>
I ask this question because there&#39;s serious discussions afoot to switch OMPI&#39;s main SVN repo to Git, and I want to get a feel for the current landscape out there.<br>
