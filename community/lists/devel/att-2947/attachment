<html><head><style type="text/css"><!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --></style></head><body><div style="font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:10pt">Dear Developers<br>I am planning to port tcp component to xensocket, which is a fast interdomain communication mechanism for guest domains in Xen. I may add that Xensocket is one way socket and I must admit before writing further that I am totally new to OpenMPI or any other mpi implementation for that matter. <br><br>As per design, and the fact that these sockets are not normal sockets, I have to pass certain information (basically memory references, guest domain info etc) to other peers once sockets have been created. I understand that mca_pml_base_modex_send and recv (or simply using&nbsp; mca_btl_tcp_component_exchange) can be used to exchange information, but I cannot seem to get them to communicate. So to put my question in a very simple way..... I want to create a socket structure
 containing necessary information, and then pass it to all other peers before start of actual mpi communication. What is the easiest way to do it.<br><br>Any pointer to right direction is appreciated. <br><div>&nbsp;</div>Thanks and Best Regards<br>Atif<div><br></div></div><br>
