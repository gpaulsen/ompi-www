Unfortunately it's not just enough to wrap it in tags, because it's possible that the output will contain XML formatting information. There are two ways to get around this. The easiest is to wrap the output in "&lt;![CDATA[" and "]]>". This has the benefit of being relatively easy, but will fail if the output contains the string "]]>". The other way is to replace all instances of "&amp;", "&lt;", and ">" with "&amp;amp;", "&amp;lt;", and "&amp;gt;" respectively. This is safer, but requires more processing.<br> <br> Thoughts?</blockquote></div><div><br>"Ick" immediately comes to mind, but is hardly helpful. :-)<br><br>I am already doing some processing to deal with linefeeds in the middle of output streams, so adding these three special chars isn't -that- big a deal.
