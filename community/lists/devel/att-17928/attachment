Hello,<br>
<br>
I am the one who discovered the PSM vs. PSM2 library conflict and<br>
proposed the temporary workaround of having two builds of the openmpi<br>
package.<br>

&gt; 3. Except if the distro builds OMPI statically, I see no reason to<br>
&gt; have 2 build of OMPI due to conflicting symbols between two shared<br>
&gt; libraries that OMPI MCA load willingly. Why a simple &quot;mtl = ^psm&quot; in<br>
&gt; the OMPI system wide configuration file is not enough to solve the<br>
&gt; issue?<br>
<br>
</span>Thank you for this suggestion. It would go into openmpi-mca-params.conf,<br>
right? I will try it.<br>
<br>
