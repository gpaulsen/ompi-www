=============<br>
<br>
Will anyone be attending from Europe?<br>
<br>
This may influence the location of the meeting.<br>

MORE DETAIL<br>
===========<br>
<br>
We&#39;re tentatively thinking that Dallas, TX would be a good location for the meeting (at the Cisco facility).  The rationale was as follows:<br>
<br>
1. Chicago is nice and central, but the weather in Jan/Feb can lead to travel problems<br>
2. The San Francisco Bay area is also nice, but is not very central<br>
3. Dallas was seen as a compromise:<br>
   - it&#39;s central<br>
   - it&#39;s likely a 1-flight for most US attendees<br>
   - it&#39;s less likely to have weather-related travel problems in Jan/Feb<br>
<br>
However, it was brought to my attention today that San Francisco (or Atlanta or New York?) may be more attractive to European attendees.  I.e., there&#39;s few direct flights from Europe to Dallas (if any?).<br>

&gt; Hi Folks,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; We&#39;ve gotten a number of responses to the doodle poll<br>
&gt; for a week to hold the next OMPI developers F2F.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The responses are definitely favoring a meeting the<br>
&gt; week of January 26th.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The poll will be kept open till COB (PST) Friday,<br>
&gt; the 7th of November.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Thanks,<br>
&gt;<br>
