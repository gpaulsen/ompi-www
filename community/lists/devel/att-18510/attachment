&gt; Hmm.  I&#39;m of split mind here.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I can see what Howard is saying here -- adding complexity is usually a bad thing.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; But we have gotten these problem reports multiple times over the years: someone *thinking* that they have built with launcher support X (e.g., TM, LSF), but then figuring out later that things aren&#39;t running as expected, and after a bunch of work, figure out that it&#39;s because they didn&#39;t build with support X.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Gilles idea actually sounds interesting -- if the tm module detect some of the sentinel PBS/TM env variables, emit a show_help() if we don&#39;t have full TM support compiled in.  This would actually save some users a bunch of time and frustration.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; --&gt; Keep in mind that the SLRUM launcher is different, because it&#39;s all CLI-based (not API-based) and therefore we always build it (because we don&#39;t have to find headers and libraries).<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; FWIW, we do have precedent of having extra MCA params for users to turn off warnings that they don&#39;t want to see.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I guess the question here is: is there a valid use case for running in PBS/Torque and *not* wanting to use the TM launcher?<br>
<br>
</span>Once case comes to mind. In the case of Cray systems that unfortunately<br>
run Moab/Toque we can launch using either alps or torque (Howard correct<br>
me if I am wrong). When Sam and I originally wrote the XE support we<br>
used alps instead of torque. I am not entirely sure what we do now.<br>
