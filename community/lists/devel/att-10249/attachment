<div>As for a corresponding patch for 1.4: the only difference is OPAL_ vs OMPI_ prefixes for configure variables in the relevant portion of opal/asm/Makefile.am.  With that in mind it should be simple to &quot;s/OPAL_/OMPI_/g&quot; the existing patch to get it to apply to 1.4.x.</div>

I&#39;ve green lighted the 1.5 patch for netbsd (I think we need a corresponding fix posted for v1.4), and asked Terry to act on your Solaris comments.<br>
<br>
We&#39;ll talk today on the call about what to do with OS X 10.3/ppc and opensbd ROMIO issues.<br>
