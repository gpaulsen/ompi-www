<div dir="ltr">I can also picture an environment where different projects can supply component that would technically belong to a framework from another project. Let me take an example. Imagine we decide to keep the RML-based connection setup for SM, thing that is not currently possible in the OPAL layer. In this case the default OPAL build will only propose generic connection capabilities, such as connection method using an atomic file opening operation. However, the OMPI layer could provide a connector components, that will expose the same interface as the OPAL connectors, but will have access to the RML communications via the selected RTE. Today, because the project name is not in the naming scheme such an approach is possible...<div>

&gt; Jeff and I were talking about some namespacing issues that have come up in the recent BTL move from OMPI to OPAL.  AFAIK, the current system for namespacing external symbols is to name them &quot;mca_FRAMEWORK_COMPONENT_symbol&quot; (e.g., &quot;mca_btl_tcp_add_procs&quot; in the tcp BTL).  Similarly, the DSO for the component is named &quot;mca_FRAMEWORK_COMPONENT.so&quot; (e.g., &quot;mca_btl_tcp.so&quot;).<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; Jeff asserted that the eventual goal is to move to a system where all MCA frameworks/components are also prefixed by the project name.  So the above examples become &quot;mca_ompi_btl_tcp_add_procs&quot; and &quot;mca_ompi_btl_tcp.so&quot;.  Does anyone actually care about pursuing this goal?<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; I ask because if nobody wants to pursue the goal of adding project names to namespaces then I already have an easy solution to most of our namespacing problems.  OTOH, if someone does wish to pursue that goal, then I have a namespace-related RFC that I would like to propose (in a subsequent email).<br>
