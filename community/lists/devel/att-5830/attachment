<div class="gmail_quote"><div><br></div>Hi All,<br><br>I am new to MPI library. I downloaded and started using OpenMPI library to build MPI programs. I wanted to know how does MPI program communicates over the network. I am trying to trace the flow of MPI_Send and MPI_Bcast APIS to find the actual send/recv calls being used for sending the packets over the network. I was trying to look into the code , I found some tcp related socket connections in code base in &quot;ompi/mca/btl/tcp/&quot; but I am not able to figureout how does MPI_Send works. Please if anyone knows how MPI_Send and MPI_Recv APIs works for communicating over network,please let me know. <br>
