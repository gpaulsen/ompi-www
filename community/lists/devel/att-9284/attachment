Rightly so. &nbsp;Sorry for posting a bug to the developer list. &nbsp;It's just that the bug was years old and had compiled on so many systems, plus the gfortran error message was entirely unhelpful, so I hadn't realized to look at the arguments as the cause of the error. My guess is that the F90 module in other distrubutions (MPICH, MVAPICH, IBM, ...) don't declare "intent" on the variables, so it always just went through.<br><br><div>Thanks again,<br>Dan</div><div><br><br>&gt; From: jsquyres@cisco.com<br>&gt; Date: Sat, 21 May 2011 06:46:15 -0400<br>&gt; To: devel@open-mpi.org<br>&gt; CC: devel@open-mpi.org<br>&gt; Subject: Re: [OMPI devel] F90 open-mpi module bug<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Nick's right - changing your test program to use ierr instead of 0 makes it compile on OMPI for me.  Hence, the F90 module is actually doing exactly what it is supposed to do: tell you when you have a compile time error in your code. :)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I'm not sure why it compiles for you on MPICH - perhaps they don't have an explicit F90 interface for MPI_ABORT...?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Sent from my phone.
