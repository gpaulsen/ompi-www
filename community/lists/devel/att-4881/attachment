All:<div><br></div><div>We are close to being ready to post the first release candidate for v1.3. &nbsp;I think that it is important</div><div>to get a significant&nbsp;amount of testing on it; and not just with MTT but also people taking the time</div>
<div>to ensure the installation works in their environment, man pages and READMEs are</div><div>accurate and the like.</div><div><br></div><div>So, I would like&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;1) send out a call for specific testing of the upcoming 1.3 release candidates, and</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;2) would like to get some feedback on what testing, in addition to MTT, people will</div><div>be able to do. &nbsp;This doesn&#39;t have to be a detailed list, but just enough to get a better</div><div>idea of the coverage the 1.3 release candidates will be getting.</div>
<div><br></div><div>I&#39;ll start the ball rolling by sharing my test environment for 1.3rc1. &nbsp;I don&#39;t have&nbsp;</div><div>any large clusters, but I do have quite a bit of variety, so will be doing functional</div><div>testing in the following environment:</div>
<div>- heterogeneous 64-bit IB cluster&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;8-way ppc64 systems with IBM 12x eHCAs</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;x86_64 systems with Mellanox 4x SDR HCAs</div><div>- 64-bit x86_64 IB cluster</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;multi-core x86_64 Opteron nodes with Mellanox 4x DDR HCAs</div>
<div>- 32-bit x86 IB cluster</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;vanilla x86 IB cluster with Mellanox SDR HCAs</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div>Please let us know via this list what you can commit to testing. &nbsp;This will help us all</div><div>release a better and more stable product.</div>
<div><br></div><div>thanks,</div><div>--brad</div><div><br></div><div>Brad Benton</div><div>v1.3 co-release manager</div><div><br></div>
