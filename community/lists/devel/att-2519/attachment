<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">I was issuing an MPI_Bcast in a sample
program and was hitting an unknown error; at least that was what MPI was
telling me. I traced through the code to find my error and came upon MCA_PML_CM_REQUEST_INIT_COMMON
macro function in pml_cm_sendreq.h. I looked at the function and noticed
that in this function the elements of req_status were getting initialized;
however, req_status.MPI_ERROR was not. I thought that maybe MPI_ERROR must
also require initialization because if the value of MPI_ERROR was some
arbitrary value not equal to MPI_SUCCESS then my program will definitely
die. Unless, MPI_ERROR is propragating from upper layers to signify an
error, but I wasn't sure. Anyway, I assumed that MPI_ERROR was not propagating
from upper layers, so then I set req_status.MPI_ERROR to MPI_SUCCUSS and
reran my test program. My program worked. Now, having gotten my program
to work, I thought I should run this by you to make sure that MPI_ERROR
was not propagating from upper layers. Is it ok that I did a:</font>

= MPI_SUCCESS;&quot; in MCA_PML_CM_REQUEST_INIT_COMMON?</font>
