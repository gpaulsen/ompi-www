I decided to use an environment with Fedora 5 and gcc 4.1.0.<div>I tried to installed 1.6.2 and it failed, then tried 1.4.5 and it failed, then 1.2.9 and I did not get any error.</div><div><br></div><div>how I can check if the installation works, prior to&nbsp;configure the cluster</div><div>Also, it will be ok if I copy the openmpi-1.2.9 &nbsp;directory to the other nodes? The installation took like almost 3 hours.</div><div><br></div><div><div>I sent the "ccIVTymL.out" file to the forum but my mail is waiting for moderator approval</div><div><br></div>Thanks<br>Sandra Guija<br></div><div><br><div><div id="SkyDrivePlaceholder"></div>&gt; From: jsquyres@cisco.com<br>&gt; Date: Wed, 3 Oct 2012 14:12:03 -0400<br>&gt; To: devel@open-mpi.org<br>&gt; Subject: Re: [OMPI devel] Open-mpi in red hat 7.3<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Question: why such an old OS?  Can you upgrade it?  Fedora 7.3 (which is what I assume you mean) and gcc 2.96 are pretty ancient, in computer software terms -- gcc 2.96 is *over 12 years old*.  That's an eternity.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Additional suggestion: we haven't tested with gcc 2.96 in quite a while, and don't maintain lists of what versions work with (really) old compilers; sorry.  Ralph's suggestion is a good one -- start with the latest Open MPI (1.6.2) and see if that works.  If it doesn't, work backwards in our release series and see which works for you (e.g., if 1.6.2 doesn't work, try the last release in the 1.4.x series -- 1.4.5.  If that doesn't work, try the last release in the 1.2.x series -- 1.2.9.  If that doesn't work, try the last release in the 1.1.x and 1.0.x series).<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; On Oct 3, 2012, at 1:30 PM, Ralph Castain wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; &gt; Not sure why any of them wouldn't successfully install - so why not grab 1.6.2?
