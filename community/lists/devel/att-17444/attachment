&gt; Folks,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; this RFC is a follow-up of<br>
&gt; * issue 585 <a href="https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/issues/585" target="_blank">https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/issues/585</a><br>

&gt; As some of you might have already noticed, Open MPI fails if configure&#39;d with --enable-ipv6 and ipv6 interfaces are found on the system.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The root cause is IPv6 link-local addresses are not (yet) correctly handled.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Wikipedia has a good pages about link-locak addresses at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-local_address" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-local_address</a><br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; basically, in IPv4, link-local addresses are <a href="http://169.254.0.0/16" target="_blank">169.254.0.0/16</a> and should be used only when zeroconf&#39;ing the IP stack.<br>
&gt; on the other hand, IPv6 are fe80::/10, are also used when zeroconf&#39;ing, but must always be present, in addition of a non link-local address.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Currently, these addresses are considered as regular addresses, but the tcp btl (and probably oob tcp too) do not know how to handle them, and that causes OpenMPI crash.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I can think of three options :<br>
&gt; 1) it is very unlikely a user wants Open MPI use a link-local address, so link-local addresses should be simply skipped<br>
&gt; 2) each module should decide if/how to handle link-local addresses<br>
&gt; 3) all modules should correctly handle link-local addresses (that requires some extra devel)<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; as far as i am concerned, i am fine with 1) because i think it is very unlikely an user ever wants to use link-local addresses.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Thanks in advance for your feedback so we can move forward.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Cheers,<br>
&gt;<br>
