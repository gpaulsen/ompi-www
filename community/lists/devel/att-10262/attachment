Hello @ll.<div><br></div><div>George, i&#39;m using some pieces of the pessimist vprotocol. I&#39;ve observed that when you do a send, you call vprotocol_receiver_event_flush and here the macro <b>__VPROTOCOL_RECEIVER_SEND_BUFFER</b> is called. I&#39;ve noticed that here you try send a copy of the message to process 0 using the el_comm. This section of code is never executed, at least in my examples. So, the message is never sent to the Event Logger, am i correct with this?  I think that this is happening because the <b>mca_vprotocol_pessimist.event_buffer_length</b> is always 0.</div>
<div><br></div><div>Is there something that i&#39;ve got to turn on, or i will have to modify this behavior manually to connect and send messages to the EL?</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks in advance.</div><div><br></div>
