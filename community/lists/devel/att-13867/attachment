<div dir="ltr">Testing the trunk w/ xlc-11.1 on a linux/ppc64 system I see two failures from &quot;make check&quot;.  Specifically the atomic_cmpset and atomic_spinlock tests both get segfaults.<div><br></div><div>This is an issue I first reported against 1.5.5rc2 and v1.6.</div>
<div><br></div><div>It appears that ticket 3040 was opened at the time of my original report, and my patch (attached to the ticket) was applied to v1.6 as r26226.  HOWEVER, the patch never seems to have made into trunk at the time; and thus is not in either v1.7 or trunk today.</div>
<div><br></div><div>Though the ticket indicates (and my testing today confirms) that xlc-11 will botch the atomic both with and without the patch, there *are* versions of xlc which only generate correct atomics with the patch applied.</div>
<div><br></div><div>So, please CMR r26226 from v1.6 to v1.7(.5?) and trunk.</div><div>The patch still applies cleanly (offset of 1 line).</div><div><br></div><div>-Paul<br clear="all"><div><br></div>-- <br><font face="courier new, monospace"><div>
