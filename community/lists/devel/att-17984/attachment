The only environment where such a functionality makes sense is where disjoint applications (think computing part and the visualization part) are able to connect together.

&gt; Given lack of use out there, I don’t see a reason to hold release of the 2.x series over this issue. Will keep you posted on progress towards a resolution<br>

That being said, I think it *would* be useful to be able to connect/accept between &quot;two jobs started by different mpiruns.&quot;  It&#39;s a bit of a chicken-n-egg problem: no one does it because no one supports it, and vice versa.<br>
<br>
I agree it&#39;s low in the priority list, but I&#39;d put the &quot;two jobs started by different mpiruns&quot; in the &quot;nice to have&quot; category.<br>
