<p>We are now feature complete for v2.0.0 and would appreciate testing by developers and end users before we finalize the v2.0.0 release.  In that light, v2.0.0rc3 is now available:</p>
<p><span>    <span><a href="https://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v2.x/" target="_blank">https://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v2.x/</a></span></span></p><p>Here are the changes since 2.0.0rc2:</p><p>- The MPI C++ bindings -- which were removed from the MPI standard in<br>   v3.0 -- are no longer built by default and will be removed in some<br>   future version of Open MPI.  Use the --enable-mpi-cxx-bindings<br>   configure option to build the deprecated/removed MPI C++ bindings.</p><p>--&gt; NOTE: this is not new, actually -- but we just added it to the NEWS file.</p><p>- In environments where mpirun cannot automatically determine the<br>  number of slots available (e.g., when using a hostfile that does not<br>  specify &quot;slots&quot;, or when using --host without specifying a &quot;:N&quot; <br>  suffix to hostnames), mpirun now requires the use of &quot;-np N&quot; to<br>  specify how many MPI processes to launch.</p><p>- Many updates and fixes to the revamped memory hooks infrastructure</p><p>- Various configure-related compatibility updates for newer versions<br>   of libibverbs and OFED.</p><p>- Properly detect Intel TrueScale and OmniPath devices in the ACTIVE<br>  state.  Thanks to Durga Choudhury for reporting the issue.</p><p>- Fix MPI_IREDUCE_SCATTER_BLOCK for a one-process communicator. Thanks<br>   to Lisandro Dalcin for reporting.</p><p>- Fix detection and use of Solaris Studio 12.5 (beta) compilers.<br>   Thanks to Paul Hargrove for reporting and debugging.</p><p>- Allow NULL arrays when creating empty MPI datatypes.<br><br>- Miscellaneous minor bug fixes in the hcoll component.<br><br>- Miscellaneous minor bug fixes in the ugni component.<br><br>- Fix various small memory leaks.</p><p>- Notable new MCA parameters:</p><p>   -  opal_progress_lp_call_ration: Control how often low-priority<br>      callbacks are made during Open MPI&#39;s main progress loop.</p><p>- Disable backtrace support by default in the PSM/PSM2 libraries to <br>  prevent unintentional conflicting behavior.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Howard</p><p>-- </p><p>Howard Pritchard<br>HPC-DES<br>Los Alamos National Laboratory</p></div>
