The opal/util/arch.c stuff also had this concern - but we couldn&#39;t figure out a solution. One thing we talked about was separating the fortran arch stuff away from the rest as the only thing I needed in opal were the non-fortran things, but we deferred that to later.<br>
<br>Adding all the rest of the fortran stuff is icky...kinda violates the opal idea, imho.<br><br><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Mon, Jun 1, 2009 at 8:41 AM, Brian W. Barrett <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:brbarret@open-mpi.org">brbarret@open-mpi.org</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br>
