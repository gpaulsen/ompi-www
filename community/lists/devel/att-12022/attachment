We're starting to use some C++ constructs to make our lives easier. In doing this, we've noticed that OpenMPI doesn't like TORQUE's libraries when built
 by gcc, it fails at the configure time claiming in can't find tm_init() in libtorque.so. I've been trying to track down exactly why, and where I am now is making me think that something in the configure script is assuming that TORQUE's libraries are compiled
 by gcc.
