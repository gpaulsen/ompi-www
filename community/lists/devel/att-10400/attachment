I should qualify that statement: many things have been resolved, but there&#39;s a few more things to go.  A new rc will come when they have been resolved:<br>

I just tried tonight&#39;s nightly tarball for the 1.5 branch (1.5.5rc2r25906).<br>
I found the following issues, which I wad previously reported against 1.5.5rc1, for which I did NOT find a corresponding ticket in &quot;report/15&quot;.  My apologies is I&#39;ve missed a ticket, or if any of these were deferred to 1.6.x (as was Lion+PGI, for instance).<br>

My MacOS 10.4/x86 machine is down, but I don&#39;t believe it had this problem w/ rc1.<br>
