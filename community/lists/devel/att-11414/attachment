&gt; That's pretty clever, actually (SVN and git effectively together in the same repo). &nbsp;Cool!<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; However, migrating to git has all the same problems that I mentioned in the prior email to you. &nbsp;Is Mellanox volunteering to do all the work for conversion?<br>
<br>
<br>
</div>I guess I should clarify -- here's what I previously sent to Mike in an off-list email about converting our main SVN repo to something else (e.g., Mercurial or Git). &nbsp;#3 is probably moot if we entirely move to github, but it would be replaced with "migrate all existing users to github" (which is a fair amount of work, too).<br>


<br>
-----<br>
We have *many* discussions a year or two ago about making Mercurial the primary repo, not SVN, and ultimately rejected it. &nbsp;There's many issues involved:<br>
<br>
1. developer learning curve<br>
&nbsp;--&gt; certainly not the biggest factor, but definitely a factor<br>
&nbsp;--&gt; "rebase" would certainly be a big deal (so that people don't put back a million intermediate commits)<br>
<br>
2. adapting all of OMPI's current scripting to use hg (or git)<br>
&nbsp;--&gt; this is a fair amount of work<br>
<br>
3. getting IU to host git instead of SVN<br>
&nbsp;--&gt; they have a whole management system for SVN: users, permissions, etc. &nbsp;No such thing exists for git.<br>
<br>
4. integrating Trac with git. &nbsp;Or migrating to a whole new bug tracker that supports git.<br>
&nbsp;--&gt; this is an entire conversation in itself. &nbsp;Note that everyone hates bugzilla.<br>
<br>
5. re-writing the SVN history to find all references to "rXXX" in commit messages and replace them with the relevant hg (git) unique commit hash<br>
&nbsp;--&gt; someone would have to figure out how to script that<br>
<br>
So conversion would be a significant amount of work. &nbsp;Instead, we opted for our current modes of operation, which seem to be working well enough:<br>
<br>
- use the hg+svn or git+svn combo mechanisms to do actual development in hg/git and then push back up to svn when done<br>
- provide hg (and now git) official mirrors so that people can branch/clone from there, and then provide patches to commit when done with development<br>
<br>
In short -- I agree with you: moving to 100% hg/git would be nice. &nbsp;But it would be a lot of work that no one was willing to spend the time to do.<br>
