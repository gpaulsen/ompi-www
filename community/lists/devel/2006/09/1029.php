Hello,
<br>

<br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; #334: Building with Libtool 2.1a fails to run OpenIB BTL
</span><br>
<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt;    Are you testing uninstalled or installed programs/libraries?
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;  Installed.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;    If you are testing an uninstalled program: does libtool generate a shell
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;  wrapper for it?  If yes: post the two shell wrappers generated by 1.5.22
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;  and HEAD.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;  I was testing with a trivial &quot;hello world&quot; MPI application; i.e., one that
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;  I had compiled with mpicc and was running with &quot;mpirun -np 2 --mca btl
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;  openib hello&quot;.  Hence, I was testing against installed trees of Open MPI.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;  I took care to &quot;rm -rf&quot; the installation tree before testing each so that
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;  there would be no kruft left from prior installs.
</span><br>
<p>OK, I can only assume that with 1.5.22, some code links against
<br>
libibverbs, or loads it earlier at runtime, so that the symbol is
<br>
present.  In any case I wonder why mthca.so isn't linked directly
<br>
against libibverbs (maybe useful to suggest that to upstream).
<br>
<p>To find out the culprit, here's a couple of quick (well) ways:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;diff build-with-lt1.5/Makefile build-with-lt2.1a/Makefile
<br>
<p>and look for differences in library link variables.  Otherwise, the
<br>
config.log outputs should give clues.
<br>
<p>To give you some more hints for possible causes: ompi_info could have a
<br>
different set of RPATH entries, or different NEEDED libraries than your
<br>
test executable; if any of those cause libibverbs.so to be loaded, then
<br>
the symbol would be visible already.  Maybe your test executables even
<br>
have different RPATHs or NEEDED libs (find out with 'objdump -p' and
<br>
ldd)?
<br>
<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt;  I've attached 2 tarballs to the bug (you have to go to the URL of the bug
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;  to get them; they are not included in the mails):
</span><br>
<p>If there are tarballs available at
<br>
<a href="http://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/ticket/334">http://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/ticket/334</a>, then I'm too blind to find
<br>
them.  Would that be elsewhere?
<br>
<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt;   * One with all the configure output and the wrapper script for ompi_info.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;  Note that ompi_info -- which lt_dlopen()'s the OpenIB BTL -- does not show
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;  the same problem (i.e., the OpenIB BTL opens properly and ompi_info shows
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;  its information).  This happens with both the uninstalled and installed
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;  ompi_info.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;   * Another with the same for 2.1a.
</span><br>
<p>That would be very helpful.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
Ralf
