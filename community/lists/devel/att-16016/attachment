<body class='hmmessage'><div dir='ltr'>Hi,<br><br>I am implementing RMA in the Gromacs molecular simulation package and ran into an issue while using a relatively simple setup with MPI_Put with Open MPI version 1.8.3. I made a small test program, see attachment, which reproduces the issue. The issue is that the data passed to MPI_Put arrives incompletely at the receiver end.<br>I have been unable to reproduce the issue with version 1.7.2/4 or MPICH 3.1.2.<br>Note that I have only ran it on a single processor, i.e. using shared memory.<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Berk<br><br> 		 	   		  </div></body>
