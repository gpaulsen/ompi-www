It's that time of year again: it's our annual review of those with write access to our Git repos.
<div class=""><br class="">
</div>
<div class="">The purpose is simply to trim those who are no longer active, or otherwise no longer need write access to Open MPI repositories. &nbsp;We don't want people moving to new jobs and still having write access to our code bases; this is our annual reminder
 to remove such accounts.</div>

<div class="">2. Find your organization.</div>
<div class=""><br class="">
</div>
<div class="">3. Examine each person in your organization:</div>
<div class="">&nbsp; &nbsp;- I've marked each Git repo that each person currently has WRITE access to</div>
<div class="">&nbsp; &nbsp;*** If that person can be dropped from all Open MPI repos, color that person's row
<font color="#ffaa00" class=""><b class="">ORANGE</b></font></div>
<div class="">&nbsp; &nbsp;*** If that person still needs WRITE git repo access, place an X in the corresponding &quot;Need commit?&quot; column</div>
<div class="">&nbsp; &nbsp;*** Once you are done checking each person, color that person's row
<font color="#96d35f" class=""><b class="">GREEN</b></font> so that we know this row is done</div>
<div class=""><br class="">
</div>
<div class=""><font color="#ff4013" class=""><b class="">### Please only mark off members who actually need write access in the foreseeable future.</b></font></div>
<div class=""><br class="">
</div>
<div class="">If someone in your org *might* need access at some point in the future, we can add them in the future -- it's a quick/easy process to do so. &nbsp;<i class="">Meaning: please don't mark someone as needing access *now* if they only *might* need access
 in the future.</i></div>
