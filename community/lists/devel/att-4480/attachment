If two separate mpirun invocations share a node and attempt to use paffinity, they will conflict with each other. The problem isn't caused by the hostfile sub-allocation. The problem is that the two mpiruns have no knowledge of each other's actions, and hence assign node ranks to each process independently.<br> <br> Thus, we would have two procs that think they are node rank=0 and should therefore bind to the 0 processor, and so on up the line.<br> <br> Obviously, if you run within one mpirun and have two app_contexts, the hostfile sub-allocation is fine - mpirun will track node rank across the app_contexts. It is only the use of multiple mpiruns that share nodes that causes the problem.<br> <br> Several of us have discussed this problem and have a proposed solution for 1.4. Once we get past 1.3 (someday!), we'll bring it to the group.<div><span class="e" id="q_11b6ad48d034a573_1"><br> <br> <br> On Jul 28, 2008, at 10:44 AM, Tim Mattox wrote:<br> <br> <blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex"> My only concern is how will this interact with PLPA.<br> Say two Open MPI jobs each use "half" the cores (slots) on a<br> particular node... &nbsp;how would they be able to bind themselves to<br> a disjoint set of cores? &nbsp;I'm not asking you to solve this Ralph, I'm<br> just pointing it out so we can maybe warn users that if both jobs sharing<br> a node try to use processor affinity, we don't make that magically work well,<br> and that we would expect it to do quite poorly.<br> <br> I could see disabling paffinity and/or warning if it was enabled for<br> one of these "fractional" nodes.<br> <br> On Mon, Jul 28, 2008 at 11:43 AM, Ralph Castain &lt;<a href="mailto:rhc@lanl.gov" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">rhc@lanl.gov</a>> wrote:<br> <blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex"> Per an earlier telecon, I have modified the hostfile behavior slightly to<br> allow hostfiles to subdivide allocations.<br> <br> Briefly: given an allocation, we allow users to specify --hostfile on a<br> per-app_context basis.
