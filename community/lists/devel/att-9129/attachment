You really don&#39;t want to do it that way - you&#39;ll create a major confusion in mpirun and the other daemons about who is where. Have you looked at the code in orte/mca/errmgr/hnp/errmgr_hnp.c, line 1573 and following?<br>
</blockquote><div>I did not look at that, but i will do it right now. </div><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;">

The ability to relocate a failed child process is already in the trunk - it only requires turning &quot;on&quot; with an --enable-recovery flag at runtime if you don&#39;t need the checkpoint/restart support. If you do need C/R, you can use that too (just requires some configure flags).<br>
</blockquote><div>About this, i&#39;m needing C/R support, because what i&#39;m trying to do is to restart a process in another node(as a child of the orted residing there) from a previous checkpoint .I will take a look to the relocation feature that you are mentioning and try to use it.</div>

At the least, the cited code should provide guidance on how to correctly restart procs if you need your own errmgr module for other reasons.<br></blockquote><div><br></div><div>Again thanks Ralph, you have been very helpful.</div>
