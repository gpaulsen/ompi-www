<br>
The usnic BTL uses libfabric; the usnic provider in libfabric can use either libnl or libnl3.  I don&#39;t know what else in OFED uses libnl -- perhaps IBoIP (aka RoCE)?<br>
<br>
We&#39;ve talked about this internally.  But sadly, we haven&#39;t come up with a good+reliable way to run-time detect if both libnl and libnl3 are present in the same process (e.g., if some of OMPI&#39;s dependent libraries pull them both in).  We could try to opal_dl_open() NULL and them look for symbols that are unique to libnl and libnl3, but a) when to do that, and b) it&#39;s not guaranteed to work in all cases.<br>

&gt; Folks,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I recently installed libnl3-devel rpm on my centos 7 box, reconfigured and recompiled ompi, and ompi_info now crashes.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; it seems the root cause is an obscure conflict between libnl and libnl3.<br>
&gt; libnl is indirectly required by the common_verbs mac (OFED libraries do need it) and libnl3 is required by reachable_netlink mca when available.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; currently, there are two workarounds available<br>
&gt; 1. uninstall libln3-devel rpm, so reachable_netlink mca uses libnl<br>
&gt; 2. configure with --without-verbs so no mac requires libnl<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; right now, my best bet would be not to use libnl3 when configure&#39;d with --verbs and OFED is available.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; any thoughts ?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Cheers,<br>
&gt;<br>
