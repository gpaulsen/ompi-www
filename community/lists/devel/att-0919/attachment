a checkpoint/restart.&nbsp; Hence, if the checkpoint/restart frameworks are laid 
out right -- and I think they are -- pause/resume may just be a component in the

  problem lies in what you do when you receive it. Take the example of a launch 
  that used orted daemons. We could pass the "stop" or "continue" message to the 
  orted, which could signal its child processes (i.e., the application processes 
  on that node) with the appropriate signal. That would stop/continue the child 
  process just fine - but what about communications that are still in-progress?? 
  Bad news.<BR><BR>So instead you could pass the application process a "stop" 
  message. The process could then "quiet" the MPI-based messaging system, reply 
  back to the orted that all is now quiet, and then the orted could send the 
  appropriate OS-level signal so the process would truly "stop". "Continue" is 
  much easier, of course - there is no "quieting" to be done, so the orted could 
  just issue a "continue" signal to its children.<BR><BR>Great - except we still 
  haven't "stopped" the run-time! What happens if the registry is in the middle 
  of a notification process (e.g., we hit a stage gate and all the notification 
  messages are being sent, or someone is in the middle of a put that causes a 
  set of subscriptions to fire and send out messages - that may in turn cause 
  additional action on the remote host)? What about messages being routed 
  through the orteds (once we get the routing system in-place)?<BR><BR>Well, we 
  now could go through a similar process to first "quiet" the run-time itself. 
  We would have to ensure that every subsystem completed its on-going operation 
  and then "stopped". We would of course have to tell all the remote processes 
  to "stop" first so that new requests would quit coming in, or else this 
  process would never complete. Note that this means the remote processes would 
  have to receive and "log" any notifications that come in from the registry 
  after we tell the process to "stop", but could not take action on those 
  notices until we "continue" the process.<BR><BR>So now we have the MPI and 
  run-time layers "quiet". We send a message to the remote orteds indicating 
  they should go ahead and send their local application processes an OS-level 
  signal to "stop" so that the OS knows not to spend cycles on them. 
  Unfortunately, we cannot do the same for the orteds themselves, so that means 
  that the orteds remain "awake" and operating, but they can just 
  "spin".<BR><BR>All sounds fine. Now all we have to deal with are: all the race 
  conditions inherent in what I just described; how to deal with receipt of 
  asynchronous notifications when we've already been told to stop; the scenarios 
  where we don't have orted daemons on every node; how to stop/restart major MPI 
  collectives in mid operation; etc. etc.<BR><BR>Not saying it cannot be done - 
  just indicating that there were reasons why it wasn't initially done other 
  than "we just didn't get around to it". <SPAN class=moz-smiley-s1><SPAN>:-)

Specifically, mpirun is not intercepting SIGSTOP and passing it on to
the remote nodes.  There is nothing in the design or architecture that
would prevent this, but we just don't do it [yet].

Subject: [OMPI devel] SIGSTOP and SIGCONT on orted

Hi,

I have a question on signals. Normally when I do a SIGTERM 
(control-C) 
on mpirun, the signal seems to get handled in a way that it 
broadcasts 
to the orted and processes on the execution hosts. However, 
when I send 
a SIGSTOP to mpirun, mpirun seems to have stopped, but the 
processes of 
the user executable continue to run. I guess I could hook up the 
debugger to mpirun and orted to see why they are handled differently, 
but I guess I anxious to hear about it here.

I am trying to see the behavior of SIGSTOP and SIGCONT for the 
suspension/resumption feature in N1GE. It'll try to use these 
signals to 
stop and continue both mpirun and orted (and its processes), but the 
signals (SIGSTOP and SIGCONT) don't seem to get propagated to 
the remote 
orted.

I can see there are some issues for implementing this feature on N1GE 
because the 'qrsh' interface does not send the signal to orted on the 
remote node, but only to 'mpirun'. I am trying to see how to 
work around 
this.
