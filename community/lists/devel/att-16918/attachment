<div dir="ltr">Let&#39;s see if I understand you correctly. You are running &quot;mpirun&quot; on the master node, with your applications running on other nodes in the cluster. In that situation, mpirun is using TCP sockets to communicate with the OMPI daemons on the remote nodes, and you would like to know which Ethernet interface on the master node is being used for that purpose.<div><br></div><div>Correct? If so, then add &quot;-mca oob_base_verbose 30&quot; to your cmd line. You&#39;ll get a bunch of output as it will report everything about the messaging system, but you&#39;ll early on see which interface is being used. I would suggest just running it with one non-master node and doing a &quot;hostname&quot; command to limit the noise.</div><div><br></div><div>The selection of interface is done the same way every time, so it will wind up picking the same interface unless the backend nodes change their connectivity.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div><div class="gmail_extra"><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Mon, Feb 2, 2015 at 10:52 PM, khushi popat <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:popat.khushi@gmail.com" target="_blank">popat.khushi@gmail.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex"><div dir="ltr"><div><div>hello,<br><br><br></div>can anyone tell how to get idea about which interface of master node is being used while i m running open mpi program on cluster from master node ??<br><br><br></div>thanking you <br><span class="HOEnZb"><font color="#888888">khushi<br></font></span></div>
