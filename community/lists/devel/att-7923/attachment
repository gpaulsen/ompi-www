<BR>
Recently someone reported issues which were traced back to<BR>
the fact that the files that sm uses for mmap() were in a<BR>
/tmp which was NFS mounted; changing the location where their<BR>
files were kept to another directory with the orte_tmpdir_base<BR>
MCA parameter fixed that issue for them.<BR>
<BR>
Could it be similar for yourself ?<BR>
