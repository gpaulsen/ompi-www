New configure-time test added - thanks for the suggestion, Jeff.&nbsp;
Update and give it a whirl.

Ethan - could you please try again?&nbsp; This time, I'm hoping sysv support
will be disabled ;-).

Write a small C program that does something like the following (this is
off the top of my head):
      <br>
      <br>
fork a child
      <br>
child goes to sleep immediately
      <br>
sysv alloc a segment
      <br>
attach to it
      <br>
ipc rm it
      <br>
parent wakes up child
      <br>
child tries to attach to segment
      <br>
      <br>
If that succeeds, then all is good.&nbsp; If not, then don't use this stuff.

Does anyone know of a relatively portable solution for querying a

        <br>
going to be a nightmare?&nbsp; Because, if I am reading this thread

As to performance there should be no difference in use between sys-

V shared memory and file-backed shared memory, the instructions
            <br>
issued and the MMU flags for the page should both be the same so

the performance should be identical.

Not necessarily, and possibly not so even for far-future Linuces.
          <br>
On at least one system I used, the poxious kernel wrote the complete
          <br>
file to disk before returning - all right, it did that for System V
          <br>
shared memory, too, just to a 'hidden' file!&nbsp; But, if I recall, on
          <br>
another it did that only for file-backed shared memory - however, it's
          <br>
a decade ago now and I may be misremembering.
          <br>
          <br>
Of course, that's a serious issue mainly for large segments.&nbsp; I was
          <br>
using multi-GB ones.&nbsp; I don't know how big the ones you need are.

On some systems it may be, but in bizarre, inconsistent, undocumented
          <br>
and unpredictable ways :-(&nbsp; Also, there are usually several system
          <br>
(and
          <br>
sometimes user) configuration options that change the behaviour, so
          <br>
you
          <br>
have to allow for that.&nbsp; My experience of trying to use those is that
          <br>
different uses have incompatible requirements, and most of the
          <br>
critical
          <br>
configuration parameters apply to ALL uses!
          <br>
          <br>
In my view, the configuration variability is the number one nightmare
          <br>
for trying to write portable code that uses any form of shared memory.
          <br>
ARMCI seem to agree.
