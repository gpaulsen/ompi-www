Yo Greg<br><br>I&#39;m slow, but it did hit me that there may be a simpler solution after all. I gather that the problem is that the user&#39;s output could have tags in it that match our own, thus causing tag-confusion. True?<br>
<br>My concern is that our proposed solution generates pidgin-xml which could only ever be translated by a specially written parser.

<br>Would that resolve the problem?<br>Ralph<br><br><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Tue, May 26, 2009 at 5:42 AM, Ralph Castain <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:rhc@open-mpi.org">rhc@open-mpi.org</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br>

While the XML output is working well, I&#39;ve come across an issue with stdout/stderr. Unfortunately it&#39;s not just enough to wrap it in tags, because it&#39;s possible that the output will contain XML formatting information. There are two ways to get around this. The easiest is to wrap the output in &quot;&lt;![CDATA[&quot; and &quot;]]&gt;&quot;. This has the benefit of being relatively easy, but will fail if the output contains the string &quot;]]&gt;&quot;. The other way is to replace all instances of &quot;&amp;&quot;, &quot;&lt;&quot;, and &quot;&gt;&quot; with &quot;&amp;amp;&quot;, &quot;&amp;lt;&quot;, and &quot;&amp;gt;&quot; respectively. This is safer, but requires more processing.<br>

<br>Let&#39;s give that a try and see if it resolves the problem...<br><br> </div><div class="im"><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;">
