I&#39;m not entirely sure as I&#39;m unclear as to when this component would attempt to build. I was building the latest trunk on a new (to me) system last night (Jeff&#39;s cluster) when I saw the warnings.<br><br>Jeff: have you seen them before on your cluster?<br>

At UBC, we are trying to find a new student who can maintain the SCTP<br>
BTL.  Unfortunately, it is has not been maintained since the progress<br>
engine overhaul a while ago.  At the moment, this is still on the TODO<br>
list.  I hope to get to this myself, if no student is found.<br>

It was my impression that the SCTP BTL wasn&#39;t included in any release<br>
by default.  I hope that this is still the case....<br>

Correct; it is .ompi_ignore&#39;d in the v1.3 SVN tree.<br><font color="#888888">
