We just noticed that Coverity hadn't run a new scan on Open MPI in a while.  There was some kind of issue on their side that prevented new builds from being analyzed.  But as soon as we notified Coverity of the issue, they quickly fixed it and a new build just finished being analyzed.  Yay!
<br>
<p>We submitted a new build, and it found 34 new defects.  :-(
<br>
<p>Can people please have a look?  Thanks.
