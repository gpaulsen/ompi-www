Hi Folks,
<br>
<p>I noticed cisco-community MTT results are really red/pink today.
<br>
If I try to view some of the ibm test results though, something goes
<br>
south with mtt and this is what get's posted back to my browser:
<br>
<p>Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 67108864 bytes exhausted (tried to
<br>
allocate 71 bytes) in /nfs/data/osl/www/
<br>
mtt.open-mpi.org/reporter/dashboard.inc on line 271
<br>
<p>So, I guess the first priority is do we know what's happened
<br>
with cisco MTT?
<br>
<p>Second, is this a known problem with the mtt reporter?
<br>
Is there a way to work around it?
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
<p>Howard
