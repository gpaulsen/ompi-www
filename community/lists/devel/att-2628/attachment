I am doing some work on Cray's CNL to support shared memory. To support<BR>
shared memory I need to know if processes are local or remote. For other<BR>
systems we simply use the modex in ompi_proc_get_info to get the proc's<BR>
nodeid. When using CNOS I don't need the modex to get a remote processes<BR>
nodeid. In fact, I can obtain every processes pid and nodeid (nid/pid) via a<BR>
single CNOS call.<BR>
<BR>
I have explored a couple of ways to populate the proc structures on the<BR>
CRAY. One involves using #if's to do special things in ompi_proc_get_info. I<BR>
don't like this. The second method involves adding a CNOS nameserver and<BR>
modifying the orte_process_name_t to include the orte_nodeid_t so that the<BR>
nameserver can populate all the info if it can. Prior to this change, the<BR>
orte_nodeid_t was in ompi_proc_t, which doesn't make any sense to me, it is<BR>
an orte level concept and it is only accessible in the ompi side. I also<BR>
don't like adding orte_nodeid_t to orte_process_name_t as it really doesn't<BR>
have anything to do with the a name.. I think it makes more sense to have an<BR>
orte_proc_t.. Something like the following structure:<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
struct orte_process_name_t {<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;orte_jobid_t jobid; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/**&lt; Job number */<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;orte_vpid_t vpid; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/**&lt; Process number */<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/** &quot;nodeid&quot; on which the proc resides */<BR>
};<BR>
<BR>
Struct orte_proc_t {<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;opal_list_item_t super;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;orte_process_name_t proc_name;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;orte_nodeid_t nid;<BR>
};<BR>
<BR>
struct ompi_proc_t {<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;orte_proc_t base;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;..... Etc .....<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
};<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I know there is some talk about removing the process names,,, not sure how<BR>
that fits in here but this is what makes sense to me given the current<BR>
architecture. Any thoughts here?<BR>
