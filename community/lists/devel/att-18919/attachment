Please keep in mind that at this stage, I am simply desperate to make MPI data move through this fabric in any way possible, so I have thrown all good programming practice out of the window and in the process might have added bugs.<br><br></div>The test code basically has a single call to MPI_Send() with 8 bytes of data, the smallest amount the HCA can DMA. I have a very simple mca_btl_component_progress() method that returns 0 if called before mca_btl_endpoint_send() and returns 1 if called after. I use a static variable to keep track whether endpoint_send() has been called.<br><br></div>With this, the MPI process hangs with the following stack:<br><br><span style="font-family:monospace,monospace">(gdb) bt<br>#0  0x00007f7518c60b7d in poll () from /lib64/libc.so.6<br>#1  0x00007f75183e79f6 in poll_dispatch (base=0x19cf480, tv=0x7f75177efe80) at poll.c:165<br>#2  0x00007f75183df690 in opal_libevent2022_event_base_loop (base=0x19cf480, flags=1) at event.c:1630<br>#3  0x00007f75183613d4 in progress_engine (obj=0x19cedd8) at runtime/opal_progress_threads.c:105<br>#4  0x00007f7518f3ddf5 in start_thread () from /lib64/libpthread.so.0<br>#5  0x00007f7518c6b1ad in clone () from /lib64/libc.so.6</span><br><br></div>I am using code from master branch for this work.<br><br></div>Obviously I am not doing the progress handling right, and I don&#39;t even understand how it should work, as the TCP btl does not even provide a component progress function.<br><br></div>Any relevant pointer on how this should be done is highly appreciated.<br><br></div>Thanks<br></div>Durga<br><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><br><br clear="all"><div><div><div><div><div><div class="gmail_signature"><div dir="ltr"><div><div dir="ltr">The surgeon general advises you to eat right, exercise regularly and quit ageing.</div></div></div></div></div>
