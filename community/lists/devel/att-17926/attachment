    about your third point :<br>
    some libraries does stuff in the constructors, so &quot;mtl = ^psm&quot; might
    also not work if OMPI was configure&#39;d with --disable-dlopen.<br>
    as far as i know, --disable-dlopen is quite popular (and
    --disable-shared --enable-static is not so much)<br>

                &gt;&gt; Hi folks<br>
                &gt;&gt;<br>
                &gt;&gt; I regret to say that 1.10.0 is hitting an issue
                with at least one upstream distro. Apparently, there is
                a symbol conflict between the PSM and PSM2 libraries
                that precludes building both of those MTLs at the same
                time. This is leading the distro to push for release of
                two OMPI 1.10.0 builds - one with PSM and the other with
                PSM2.<br>
                &gt;&gt;<br>
                &gt;&gt; IMO, this is a very undesirable situation. I
                agree with the distro that delaying release for some
                significant time as this would impact everyone else’s
                users. Therefore, assuming that the PSM team is unable
                to quickly resolve the problem in their libraries, my
                inclination is to release an immediate 1.10.1 with the
                PSM2 MTL removed.<br>
                &gt;&gt;<br>
                &gt;&gt; I’m soliciting input - any opinions?<br>
