Hi Jeff,<br>
sure like to try to explain the matters.<br>
The script check_unnecessary_headers.sh is not smart at all.<br>
It checks whether a header, if known, is required due to some content.<br>
It does not know about hierarchies of include files, or convenience headers<br>
such as bindings.h and would delete the very headers mention below from<br>
bindings.h.<br>
<br>
Now, only if we switch to a more sophisticated method (ctags?, munching gcc&#39;s<br>
preprocessed output?), this could be handled.<br>
<br>
My personal opinion however is, that every header and every source file should<br>
be self contained:<br>
It should include all the headers with symbols it needs, no less, and<br>
certainly not more ;-)</blockquote><div><br>That&#39;s an unusual coding style - we could debate the relative pros and cons of it for quite some time. Typically, if a body of code is going to all require the same headers, coding efficiency would put those dependencies in a common .h file, not explicitly copy/paste them into every individual file.<br>
<br>Is this a convention we adopted somewhere along the line? I don&#39;t recall doing so. Not sure if it is a good one or not...certainly would appear to merit some discussion before enforcing it.<br><br>FWIW: I understood you were simply going to remove unnecessary dependencies, not enforce new coding standards. :-)<br>

<br>
Hope, this is a satisfactory answer?<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

&gt; Can you explain this a little more:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;     In ompi/mpi/c/ header files are moved up into the actual c-file,<br>
&gt;     where necessary (these are the only additional #include),<br>
&gt;     otherwise it is only deletions of #include (apart from the above<br>
&gt;     additions required due to notifier...)<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; It looks like the addition of<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; +#include &quot;ompi/runtime/params.h&quot;<br>
&gt; +#include &quot;ompi/communicator/communicator.h&quot;<br>
&gt; +#include &quot;ompi/errhandler/errhandler.h&quot;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; to lots of ompi/mpi/c/*.c files.  I don&#39;t quite grok from your commit<br>
&gt; comment why that was a good thing...?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Thanks!<br>
