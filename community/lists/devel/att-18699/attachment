A first step in enabling this is to convert the RML framework to multi-select of active components. The stub functions then scan the components in priority order until one can perform the requested action (e.g., send a buffer). This will allow us to simultaneously support both OFI and other components.</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">While making this change, we also:</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">* removed the qos framework - this functionality has been moved to another library that builds on top of the RML</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">* removed the ftrm component - this was stale, and it wasnâ€™t clear to us how it would change under the new architecture</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">We will be adding the new OFI component in a separate PR. This just contains the change to a multi-select framework.</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">The PR is here: &nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/pull/1457" class="">https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/pull/1457</a></div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">Please feel free to comment and/or make suggestions</div><div class="">Ralph</div><div class=""><br class=""></div></body></html>
