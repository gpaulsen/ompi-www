Hello everybody,<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm a student from computer science and i doing a project about OpenMPI and i need to compile a new version of this program from the scratch it means that i need the UML or something like this to know how this program work, it will be possible that someone send it to me, this is only for academic research. 
<br><br>PS: the main idea is change something in functions send and received but first i need to compile everything with this two functions with different names without changing nothing inside only names.<br><br>Tks,<br><br>
Best Regards,<br><br>B.<br>
