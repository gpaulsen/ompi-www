<br>
Using a new network interface and its ad-hoc routing algorithms I would like to try my own custom implementation of some collective communication patterns(MPI_Bcast,MPI_Alltoall,...) without expanding those collective communications as series of point-to-point ones based on a given predefined process topology.<br>
<br>
In addition my routing methods might require additional parameters, rather than the basic destination lists obtained from that topology and the kind of collective communication considered.<br>
<br>
How would I do that ?<br>
<br>
In which component should I modilfy something ?<br>
<br>
<br>
