&gt; 1.If I write a rlogin component ,<br>
<br>
</div>Is the command line of rlogin that much different than that of rsh/ssh? &nbsp;For example, can you just s/rsh/rlogin/ on the overall command line and have it just work?<br>
<br>
If so, I suspect that tweaking the rsh plm might be far simpler than having your own component.<br>
<div><br>
&gt; can I just login in the node in the cluster and launch the process . &nbsp;If it is ,what the role the odls plays ??<br>
<br>
</div>ODLS = ORTE Daemon Local launch Subsystem.<br>
<br>
PLM = Process Lifecycle Management.<br>
<br>
Meaning: the PLM is used to launch orteds (more on this below) across multiple nodes. &nbsp;The ODLS is used to launch processes locally from the orted (e.g., via POSIX fork/exec).<br>
<div><br>
&gt; 2.what is orted? Should the orted exists in every node and functions as a node process launch proxy ?<br>
<br>
</div>Yes. &nbsp;The orted = ORTE daemon. &nbsp;It is almost always the first thing launched on each node and acts as a proxy for launching, killing, and monitoring the user's applications on each node. &nbsp;It also does other control kinds of things, like relay stdout/stderr back up to the HNP (more below), etc.<br>


<div><br>
&gt; 3,what is hnp ? Is every job has only one hnp ,and when I use mpirun , the mpirun process is hnp ??<br>
<br>
</div>HNP = head node process, meaning mpirun (or actually, orterun -- mpirun is a symlink to orterun). &nbsp;The HNP functions as an orted as well, so it can use the ODLS to launch processes locally, etc.<br>
<br>
Ralph can provide more detail on all of the above, but these are the basics.<br>
