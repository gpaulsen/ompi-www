&gt; Okay, that means that the dvm isn&#39;t recognizing that the jobs actually completed.<br>
<br>
</span>Ok.<br>
<span class=""><br>
&gt; So the question is: what is it about those jobs?<br>
<br>
</span>They are all the same.<br>
<span class=""><br>
&gt; Are those 6 jobs very short-lived, and the others are longer-lived?<br>
<br>
</span>All very short lived, as thats the easiest to reproduce it.<br>
<span class=""><br>
&gt; If you look at the nodes (before you kill the dvm), are any of those procs still there?<br>
<br>
</span>I originally ran into this on a large machine, but can reproduce it easily on my laptop so the results I&#39;ve been sending in the last messages are from runs on my laptop.<br>
<br>
The stalled orte-submits are still there obviously, but the actual task process is no longer active.<br>
