<div dir="ltr"><div><div>In v1.8 there is a RTE barrier in finalize. OMPI_LAZY_WAIT_FOR_COMPLETION waits for the barrier to complete. Internally opal_progress() is invoked. In the master branch we call PMIX fence instead. PMIX_WAIT_FOR_COMPLETION seems to only call usleep. How will ompi progress outstanding operations ?<br><br></div>Regards<br></div>--Nysal<br></div>
