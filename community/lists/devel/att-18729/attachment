<div dir="ltr">I was rummaging through the code today and made two observations related to verbose. Neither is terribly critical, but probably worth making the developer community aware.

Would it be useful to display something with this flag? Maybe set the default verbosity for all components?

(Am I correct here?) It would be nice to be able to activate some of these varbosity settings when debugging the MCA core (like trying to determine why a component is not loading). So it seems like we need an mca_base_verbose option somewhere. Any opinions here?</div><div><br></div><div>-- Josh</div><div><br></div>
