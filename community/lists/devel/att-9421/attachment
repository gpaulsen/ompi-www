Once that has occurred, we'll probably be close to what we would call a "resilient" system.</div><div><br></div><div>Until then, we are improving, but still far from "resilient".</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><div><div>On Jun 24, 2011, at 10:24 AM, Ken Lloyd wrote:</div><br class="Apple-interchange-newline"><blockquote type="cite">
