Hi all<br>
<br>
I believe I have fixed the IOF problems reported by Tim M a week ago (11/13). The fixes are in a separate Hg branch:<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/hg/hgwebdir.cgi/rhc/iof/" target="_blank">http://www.open-mpi.org/hg/hgwebdir.cgi/rhc/iof/</a><br>
<br>
Before I bring these to the trunk - and eventually migrate them to the 1.3 branch - would some of you like to run an MTT pass across the branch? I have run it through some of the tests that reported issues before, and it seems to be working just fine - but I wanted to offer a chance for people to test it prior to bringing it back into the trunk.<br>

<br>
Please let me know if/when you can do this so I can plan on when to bring this over to the trunk. If I don&#39;t hear from folks by Dec 1, I&#39;ll just bring it into the trunk so it can get tested there.<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>
Ralph<br>
