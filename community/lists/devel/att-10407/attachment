Hello,<br><br>Investigating memory management implementation in OpenMPI I found that opal&#39;s memory module licensed under Lesser GPL terms. This subsystem is linked into openMPI library. As far as I know this fact should enforce<br>
Lesser GPL license on libopen-rte.so and libopen-pal.so. Could anybody explain me how is it possible that OpenMPI have BSD license, please?<br><br>Denis  <br>
