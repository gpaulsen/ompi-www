Hi folks<br><br>We seem to have hit a problem here - it looks like we are seeing a built-in limit on the number of communicators one can create in a program. The program basically does a loop, calling MPI_Comm_split each time through the loop to create a sub-communicator, does a reduce operation on the members of the sub-communicator, and then calls MPI_Comm_free to release it (this is a minimized reproducer for the real code). After 64k times through the loop, the program fails.<br>
<br>This looks remarkably like a 16-bit index that hits a max value and then blocks.<br><br>I have looked at the communicator code, but I don&#39;t immediately see such a field. Is anyone aware of some other place where we would have a limit that would cause this problem?<br>
<br>Thanks<br>Ralph<br><br>
