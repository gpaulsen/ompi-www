<div dir="ltr">I have a seldomly occurring deadlock on a OS X laptop if I use more than 2 processes). It is coming up once every 200 runs or so.<div><br></div><div>Here is what I could gather from my experiments: All the MPI processes seem to have correctly completed (I get all the expected output and the MPI processes are in a waiting state), but somehow the mpirun does not detect their completion. As a result, mpirun never returns.</div><div><br></div><div>  George.</div><div> </div></div>
