I&#39;m not entirely sure what comment is being discussed. The comment in opal/util/arch.c (written by me long ago) should not be taken seriously - it was nothing more than a half-hearted attempt to appease the stormy controversy (mostly objections from George and a little from Brian) created by my moving this code to OPAL. It had no technical validity behind it at all.<br>
<br>Somewhat amusing to see that comment now used as justification for leaving the code there by some of the same people. ;-)<br><br>The question of whether or not we accurately deal with Fortran variable sizes was always present, even when this code was in the OMPI layer. It is a tad troublesome as Fortran advocates -do- occasionally set the flags that can cause the variables to differ from their C counterparts. Rather than some obscure comment in the source code, we should probably generate a warning and (hopefully) abort when someone uses those flags to avoid creating hard-to-debug errors.<br>

no, that&#39;s not an issue. The comment is correct: For any Fortran integer*kind<br>
we need to have _some_ C-representation as well, otherwise we disregard the<br>
type (tm), see e.g. the old  and resolved ticket #1094.<br>
The representation chosen is set in opal/util/arch.c and is conclusive as far<br>
as I can tell...<br>

Doesn&#39;t that mean that the comment is misleading?  I interpret it as saying that a Fortran &quot;default integer&quot; is always the same as a C &quot;int&quot;.  I believe that you are saying that it really means that *any* kind of Fortran integer must be the same as one of C&#39;s integral types, or OpenMPI won&#39;t support it at all.  Shouldn&#39;t the comment be clearer?<br>
