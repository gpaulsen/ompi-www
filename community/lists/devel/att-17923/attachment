&gt; what about automatically *not* building PSM2 if PSM is built and PSM2 is not explicitly required ?<br>
&gt; /* in order to be future proof, we could even do that only if we detect a symbol conflict */<br>
&gt; we could abort if ompi is configure&#39;d with both --with-psm and --with-psm2, or simply do nothing<br>
&gt; (the end user might know what he/she is doing, and there will be nothing to do on the ompi side<br>

&gt;&gt; Hi folks<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; I regret to say that 1.10.0 is hitting an issue with at least one upstream distro. Apparently, there is a symbol conflict between the PSM and PSM2 libraries that precludes building both of those MTLs at the same time. This is leading the distro to push for release of two OMPI 1.10.0 builds - one with PSM and the other with PSM2.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; IMO, this is a very undesirable situation. I agree with the distro that delaying release for some significant time as this would impact everyone else’s users. Therefore, assuming that the PSM team is unable to quickly resolve the problem in their libraries, my inclination is to release an immediate 1.10.1 with the PSM2 MTL removed.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; I’m soliciting input - any opinions?<br>
&gt;&gt; Ralph<br>
