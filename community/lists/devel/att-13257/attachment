They've been around for a very long time, but nobody has the time or will to fix them. I have no access to such machines, so all I can do is verify that it sorta compiles and is consistent with the code base. I can't verify that it works, nor debug it.<div><br></div><div>Guess my point is that someone who cares needs to cleanup the cpc vs ofacm problem and get whatever connection managers we want to support working. I removed the oob and xoob ones because (a) they don't work, and (b) I'm tired of repeatedly having to explain that to people.</div><div><br></div><div><br><div><div>On Nov 14, 2013, at 10:23 AM, Barrett, Brian W &lt;<a href="mailto:bwbarre@sandia.gov">bwbarre@sandia.gov</a>&gt; wrote:</div><br class="Apple-interchange-newline"><blockquote type="cite"><div style="font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;">On 11/14/13 11:16 AM, "Jeff Squyres (jsquyres)" &lt;<a href="mailto:jsquyres@cisco.com">jsquyres@cisco.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br><br><blockquote type="cite">On Nov 14, 2013, at 1:03 PM, Ralph Castain &lt;<a href="mailto:rhc@open-mpi.org">rhc@open-mpi.org</a>&gt; wrote:<br><br><blockquote type="cite"><blockquote type="cite">1) What the status of UDCM is (does it work reliably, does it support<br>XRC, etc.)<br></blockquote><br>Seems to be working okay on the IB systems at LANL and IU.
