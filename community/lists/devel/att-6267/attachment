The BTL's (Bit Transport Layer) actually moves the message data. Each BTL is responsible for opening its own connections - ORTE has nothing to do with it, except to transport out-of-band (OOB) messages to support creating the connection if that specific BTL requires it.</div><div><br></div><div>If you are interested in TCP communications, you will find all of that code in ompi/mca/btl/tcp. It can be confusing down there, so expect to spend a little time trying to understand it. I believe Jeff has some documentation on the OMPI web site about it (perhaps a video?).</div><div><br></div><div>The source/destination is embedded in the message, again done by each BTL since the receiver must be a BTL of the same type. Again, this has nothing to do with ORTE - it is purely up to the BTL. MPI communications are also coordinated by the PML, which is responsible for matching messages with posted receives. You might need to look at the ompi/mca/pml/ob1 code to understand how that works.</div><div><br></div><div>Hope that gives you a starting point</div><div>Ralph</div><div><br><div><div>On Jun 18, 2009, at 7:57 AM, Leo P. wrote:</div><br class="Apple-interchange-newline"><blockquote type="cite"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 0px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: none; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; "><div><div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: 'times new roman', 'new york', times, serif; font-size: 12pt; "><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">Hi Everyone,</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; "><br></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">I wanted to ask some questions about things I am having trouble understanding.</p><ol><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; ">As far as my understanding of MPI_INIT function, I assumed MPI_INIT typically procedure resources required including the sockets.

If some one could let me where exactly in the code this is happening I would appreciate a lot. I guess this is happening in ORTE layer so I am spending time looking at it.
