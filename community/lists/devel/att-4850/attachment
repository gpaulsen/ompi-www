Those of us who participated in the July ORTE meeting had so much fun, <BR>
we decided it was worth doing again! :-)<BR>
<BR>
Seriously, there are design issues that would benefit by a face-to-<BR>
face meeting with a whiteboard. We have posted a list of topics and <BR>
the proposed dates on the wiki:<BR>

<BR>
Anyone is of course welcome to participate. The meeting is being held <BR>
at the Sun offices in Menlo Park, CA, right after the MPI Forum. <BR>
Further details, along with a more detailed agenda, will follow.<BR>
<BR>
Please let us know if you plan to participate. If desired, we will <BR>
strive to setup telecons for remote participation on specific topics.<BR>
