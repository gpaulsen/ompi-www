<html><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html charset=us-ascii"></head><body style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I took a look at this, and I'm afraid you have some work to do in the orte/mca/snapc code base:<div><br></div><div>1. you must use dynamically allocated buffers for rml.send_buffer_nb. See r30261 for an example of the changes that need to be made - I did some, but can't swear to catching them all. It was enough to at least get a proc past the initial snapc registration</div><div><br></div><div>2. you are reusing collective id's to execute several orte_grpcomm.barrier calls - those ids are used elsewhere during MPI_Init. This is not allowed - a collective id can only be used *once*. What you need to do is go into orte/mca/plm/base/plm_base_launch_support.c and (when cr is configured) add cr-specific collective id's for this purpose. I don't know how many places in the cr code create their own barriers, but they each need a collective id.</div><div><br></div><div>If you prefer and have the time, you are welcome to extend the collective code to allow id reuse. This would require that each daemon and app "reset" the collective fields when a collective is declared complete. It isn't that hard to do - just never had a reason to do it. I can take a shot at it when time permits (may have some time this weekend)</div><div><br></div><div>3. when you post the non-blocking recv in the snapc/full code, it looks to me like you need to block until you get the answer. I don't know where in the code flow this is occurring - if you are not in an event, then it is okay to block using ORTE_WAIT_FOR_COMPLETION. Look in orte/mca/routed/base/routed_base_fns.c starting at line 252 for an example.</div><div><br></div><div>HTH</div><div>Ralph</div><div><br><div><div>On Jan 10, 2014, at 12:55 PM, Ralph Castain &lt;<a href="mailto:rhc@open-mpi.org">rhc@open-mpi.org</a>&gt; wrote:</div><br class="Apple-interchange-newline"><blockquote type="cite"><div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><div><br class="Apple-interchange-newline">On Jan 10, 2014, at 12:45 PM, Adrian Reber &lt;<a href="mailto:adrian@lisas.de">adrian@lisas.de</a>&gt; wrote:</div><br class="Apple-interchange-newline"><blockquote type="cite"><div style="font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;">On Fri, Jan 10, 2014 at 09:48:14AM -0800, Ralph Castain wrote:<br><blockquote type="cite"><br>On Jan 10, 2014, at 8:02 AM, Adrian Reber &lt;<a href="mailto:adrian@lisas.de">adrian@lisas.de</a>&gt; wrote:<br><br><blockquote type="cite">I am currently trying to understand how callbacks are working.

When that event gets serviced, it calls the orte_rml_base_receive function which processes the data to find the matching tag, and then uses that to execute the callback to the user code.<br><br><blockquote type="cite"><br>The same for send_buffer_nb() functions.

At least<br>in my setup.<br></blockquote><br>The data is not immediately sent. It gets pushed into an event. When that event gets serviced, it calls the orte_oob_base_send function which then passes the data to each active OOB component until one of them says it can send it. The data is then pushed into another event to get it into the event base for that component's active module - when that event gets serviced, the data is sent. Once the data is sent, an event is created that, when serviced, executes the callback to the user code.<br><br>If you aren't seeing callbacks, the most likely cause is that the orte progress thread isn't running.

In orterun I can see that the callback is running and<br>orte-top displays the retrieved information. I can also see in orte-top<br>that the callbacks are working.</div></blockquote><div><br></div>Actually, I'm rather impressed - I hadn't tested orte-top and didn't honestly know if it would work any more!
