Hi Jeff,<div>Mi error is when either I run a mpi program on the remote host or I run on the local host and include the remote host.</div><div>openmpi only works where the it was installed, local.</div><div>Plan B is to install openmpi on the remote host and try to run it , but I'm getting discourage.</div><div>I am using 1.2.9 and I found the same error in this post:</div><div>http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/users/2008/07/6034.php</div><div>My error looks exactly as the one describe above, but my fist line is: &nbsp;</div><div><span style="font-size: 10pt; ">bash: orted command not found</span></div><div>If does not work, Plan C is to try what the post recommended version 1.3, but not sure.</div><div>Any input is appreciated</div><div><span style="font-size: 10pt; ">Thanks again</span></div><div><div>Sandra Guija<br><br><div><div id="SkyDrivePlaceholder"></div>&gt; From: jsquyres@cisco.com<br>&gt; Date: Mon, 8 Oct 2012 20:19:14 -0400<br>&gt; To: devel@open-mpi.org<br>&gt; Subject: Re: [OMPI devel] Open-mpi in Fedora 5<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I'm not sure I understand -- you said you are able to run on the master, but then you said you get an error message when you run on the master.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Please see the help page I mentioned (http://www.open-mpi.org/community/help/) for a list of information that we need to be able to help you.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; If you're getting a message about permission denied for /home/openmpi/bin/orted, you should check the permissions on that file; it needs to be executable.  If it isn't executable, then you need to check how you installed Open MPI -- Open MPI's installer should have marked it as executable during the installation process.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; On Oct 7, 2012, at 12:17 PM, Sandra Guija wrote:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; &gt; Hi Jeff, <br>&gt; &gt; I shared the openpi libraries through NFS.

Use "mpirun" to launch a non-MPI program (e.g., hostname or uptime)<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; across multiple nodes.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Use "mpirun" to launch a trivial MPI program that does no MPI<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; communication (e.g., the hello_c program in the examples/ directory<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; in the Open MPI distribution).<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Use "mpirun" to launch a trivial MPI program that sends and<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; receives a few MPI messages (e.g., the ring_c program in the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; examples/ directory in the Open MPI distribution).<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; If you can run all three of these tests successfully, that is a good<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; indication that Open MPI built and installed properly.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; -----<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, it will be ok if I copy the openmpi-1.2.9 directory to the other nodes? The installation took like almost 3 hours.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Wow; configuration / compilation of Open MPI took *3 hours*? I'm guessing you have very old / low-power processors, or very slow network filesystem access...?<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; See this FAQ information on where to install OMPI:<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=building#where-to-install<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I sent the "ccIVTymL.out" file to the forum but my mail is waiting for moderator approval.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; It likely won't be approved.
