      Unfortunatly, a trivial send/recv can hang in this case
      (--enable-heterogeneous and homogenous cluster of little endian
      procs).<br>

      i opened #4568 <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/ticket/4568">https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/ticket/4568</a> in
      order to track this issue<br>
      (uninitialized data can cause a hang with this config)<br>
      <br>
      trunk is affected, v1.8 is very likely affected too<br>

        <pre wrap="">According to Jeff's comment, OpenMPI compiled with
--enable-heterogeneous is broken even in an homogeneous cluster.

as a first step, MTT could be ran with OpenMPI compiled with
--enable-heterogenous and running on an homogeneous cluster
(ideally on both little and big endian) in order to identify and fix the
bug/regression.
