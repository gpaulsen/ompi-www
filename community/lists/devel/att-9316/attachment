&gt; So if I look at the epoch of the proc sending me a message, I really can&#39;t check it against my own value as the comparison is meaningless. All I really can do is check to see if it changed from the last time I heard from that proc, which would tell me that the proc has been restarted in the interim.<br>

</div>I fail to understand your statement here. However, comparing message epoch is critical to ensure the correct behavior.  It ensures we do not react on old messages (that were floating in the system for some obscure reasons), and that we have the right contact information for a specific peer (on the correct epoch).<br>
