<p>That&#39;s fine. Let&#39;s say Thursday COB is now the timeout. </p>

Then can we hold off pushing this into the trunk for a couple days until I get a chance to test it? Monday COB does not give me much time since we just got the new patch on Friday COB (the RFC gave us 2 weeks to review the original patch). Would waiting until next Thursday/Friday COB be too disruptive? That should give me and maybe Ralph enough time to test and send any further feedback.<br>

I made quite a few changes in the last checkin though I didn&#39;t run your specific test this afternoon. I&#39;ll be able to try it later this evening but it should be easy to test now that it&#39;s synced with the trunk again.<br>

&gt;&gt; &gt; <br>&gt;&gt; &gt; If not I would ask that we holding off on putting it into the trunk<br>&gt;&gt; &gt; until that particular bug is addressed. From my experience tackling<br>&gt;&gt; &gt; this particular issues requires some code refactoring, which should<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; probably be done once in the trunk instead of two possibly disruptive<br>&gt;&gt; &gt; commits.<br>&gt;&gt; &gt; <br>&gt;&gt; &gt; -- Josh<br>&gt;&gt; &gt; <br>&gt;&gt; &gt; On Fri, Jun 17, 2011 at 5:18 PM, Wesley Bland &lt;<a href="mailto:wbland@eecs.utk.edu">wbland@eecs.utk.edu</a>&gt; wrote:<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This is a reminder that the Resilient ORTE RFC is set to go into the trunk<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; on Monday at COB.<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;ve updated the code with a few of the changes that were mentioned on and<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; off the list (moved code out of orted_comm.c, errmgr_set_callback returns<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; previous callback, post_startup function, corrected normal termination<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; issues). Please take another look at it if you have any interest. The code<br>
