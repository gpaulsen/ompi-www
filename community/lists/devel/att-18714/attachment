<div dir="ltr"><div><div><div><div><div>I am building a multiprocessor system with soft-core processor(Microblaze) and operating system xilkernel(OS from xilinx). I want to scale down Open mpi with the the functionality of mainlyÂ  sending and recieving only. Also I want the MPI library to have a low memory footprint(in kBs). <br><br></div>As my OS is not linux, I cannot install Open mpi. So I took all the .c and .h files of of Open mpi 1.4.5 and started compiling it.<br></div>Then I was planning to remove the files which won&#39;t be used by me.So I will be having only the files of desired functionality and also get lesser memory footprint.<br><br></div>But when I started building the full Open mpi. I got many errors which I&#39;m unable to solve.<br><br></div>Can you please tell me, is my approach right?<br></div>If not, what should be my approach?<br></div>
