Hi Jeff,<br>
<br>
Thanks for having a look in my unified diff (see comments in the text)<br>
<br>
I have commited all my last changes in bitbucket, including those that
follows.<br>

Do we have the MPIU functions?  Or is that an MPICH2-specific thing?

I see that you moved confdb/aclocal_cc.m4 to acinclude.m4.  Shoudn't we just -I confdb instead to get all of their .m4 files?

  </pre>
</blockquote>
This has been done during the last porting (years ago).<br>
I have now changed this: All confdb/.m4 files are now copied from
MPICH2. Only the definition of PAC_FUNC_NEEDS_DECL is still kept in
acinclude.m4.<br>
If I do not so, configure is still blocking on this macro.<br>
All seems working well so. If you have any clue about this, I will take
it !<br>

OK, I put the #if 0 again.<br>

I thought there was one other thing that I saw, but I can't recall it right now...

This is just from looking at your diff; I didn't try to run it yet because you said there were some things that weren't pushed back up to bitbucket yet.

    <pre wrap="">Hi Jeff,

Here is the unified diff.
As only the romio subtree is modified, I made the following command:
  diff -u -r -x .svn ompi-trunk/ompi/mca/io/romio/romio/ NEW-ROMIO-FOR-OPENMPI/ompi/mca/io/romio/romio/ &gt; DIFF_UPDATE
  tar cvzf DIFF_UPDATE.TGZ DIFF_UPDATE

Compilation is OK. I run the ROMIO tests.

There are a few new modifications that are not in bitbucket. I think it is not necessary to update bitbucket (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://bitbucket.org/devezep/new-romio-for-openmpi/">http://bitbucket.org/devezep/new-romio-for-openmpi/</a> ).

      <pre wrap="">Thanks Pascal!

Is there any change you could send a unified diff of the tip of your hg vs. the SVN trunk HEAD?

E.g., if you have an hg+ssh combo tree, could you "hg up" in there to get all your work, and then "svn diff &gt; diff.out" and then compress and send the diff.out?

Thanks!

I am in charge of ticket 1888 (see at 
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/ticket/1888">https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/ticket/1888</a>
).
I have made the porting of ROMIO available in bitbucket since September 17th 2010. (
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://bitbucket.org/devezep/new-romio-for-openmpi/">http://bitbucket.org/devezep/new-romio-for-openmpi/</a>
 )
Until now, I do not have any report on this porting and it's now time to bring it into the trunk.
All modified files are located under the romio subtree.
