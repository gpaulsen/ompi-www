&gt; If oob:ud was disabled then there was no call to ibv_fork_init() anywhere else, right? If so, then this is why the messages went away.<br>
<br>
</span>Right.  That&#39;s why I&#39;m saying it doesn&#39;t seem like a PSM problem.<br>
<br>
(I don&#39;t know much about PSM, but I don&#39;t think it uses verbs...?)<br>
<span class=""><br>
&gt; The calls to ibv_fork_init() from the opal common verbs were pushed to the master. One of the places a call was set is oob:ud, but if there is a call to memory registering verbs before this place, then the call to it in oob:ud would result in a failure.<br>
<br>
</span>Yes, I think that is the exact question: why are these messages showing up because of oob:ud?  It seems like the call sequences to ibv_fork_init() are not as understood as we thought they were.  :-(  I.e., it was presupposed that oob_ud was the first entity to call any verbs code (and by your commits, is supposed to be calling the common verbs code to call ibv_fork_init() early enough such that it won&#39;t be a problem).  But either that is not the case, or ibv_fork_init() is failing for some other reason.<br>
<br>
These are the things that need to be figured out.<br>
