Do you remember why we include <a href="http://autogen.pl" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">autogen.pl</a> in distribution tarballs?<br>
<br>
My recollection is:<br>
<br>
1. It was handy for OMPI developers to &quot;make dist&quot; in a SVN checkout to take a tarball over to back-end machine where you couldn&#39;t do an SVN checkout.  In short: including autogen.* in the tarball (and all of its machinery) makes &quot;make dist&quot; tarballs that are functional for an OMPI developer.<br>
<br>
2. We wanted to be friendly to 3rd-party vendors who have their own out-of-tree plugins.  They can take an official release tarball, add their components into the source tree, run autogen, and be good to go.<br>
<br>
3. It seemed like the Right Thing to do.<br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
The question came up today on the weekly call for obscure reasons... not worth describing here.  But it raised the question, &quot;Is there a reason we include <a href="http://autogen.pl" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">autogen.pl</a> in the tarball?&quot;<br>
<br>
I dug in history, and I see that autogen.sh was added here:<br>
<br>
   <a href="https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/changeset/17505" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/changeset/17505</a><br>
<br>
It cited the wrong Trac ticket, but I found that, too:<br>
<br>
   <a href="https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/ticket/1205" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/ticket/1205</a><br>
<br>
Neither of them really talks much about *why* we added autogen.sh to the tarball.<br>
<br>
FWIW:<br>
<br>
The switch from SVN ti Git may obviate #1.<br>
<br>
#2 hasn&#39;t really ever occurred.  Although it could happen in the future, 3rd-party vendors can just grab from github at the right Git tag, too.<br>
<br>
#3 ...shrug.<br>
<br>
Do you have a memory of a stronger reason than #3 to keep <a href="http://autogen.pl" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">autogen.pl</a> in the tarball?<br>
<br>
(I don&#39;t have a super strong opinion either way, I think -- perhaps 51% in favor of removing it from the tarball, simply because we do occasionally get the user on <a href="mailto:users@open-mpi.org">users@open-mpi.org</a> who runs <a href="http://autogen.pl" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">autogen.pl</a> for no reason, and then runs into problems because they&#39;ve got old Autotools)<br>
