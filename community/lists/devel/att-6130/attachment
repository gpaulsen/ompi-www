I can&#39;t find that max hostname constraint in the above commit (probably just tired eyes). However, note that ORTE doesn&#39;t have any hostname length constraint, so if we are now adding one to the OMPI layer, we have a problem.<br>
<br>For example, in the ompi_proc_t struct, we simply point it at the ORTE name so we avoid impacting the memory footprint by copying the hostname. Thus, it isn&#39;t clear to me -where- we are restricting hostname lengths - can someone point it out?<br>
<br>FWIQ: we routinely see hostnames much longer than 16 chars on the user list and on many clusters here. Having such a small restriction will cause major problems with our user base.<br><br><br><br><div class="gmail_quote">

&gt; One thing to note about this change is that it will break binary<br>
&gt; compatibility between 1.3/1.4 and the 1.5/1.6 series (since these<br>

Where&#39;s the break??<br>

My bad -- you&#39;re entirely right.  I mis-read; you kept all the defaults exactly the same.  Good!<br>
<br>
Several of my other comments are therefore invalid.  :-)  But the _OPAL_ -&gt; OPAL_ prefix thing is still relevant (that would be the only _OPAL prefix that I&#39;m aware of).<br><font color="#888888">
