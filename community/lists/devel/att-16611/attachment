      did you manually set -mt ?<br>
      <br>
      if i remember correctly, solaris 11 (at least with gcc compilers)
      do not need any flags<br>
      (except the -D_REENTRANT that is added automatically)<br>

I will try the patch when I can.
However, our network is undergoing network maintenance right now, leaving
me unable to reach the necessary hosts.

As for -D_REENTRANT, I had already reported having verified in the "make"
output that it had been added automatically.

Additionally, the docs say that "-mt" *also* passes -D_REENTRANT to the
preprocessor.

 Paul,

could you please make sure configure added  "-D_REENTRANT" to the CFLAGS ?
/* otherwise, errno is a global variable instead of a per thread variable,
which can
explains some weird behaviour. note this should have been already fixed */

assuming -D_REENTRANT is set, could you please give the attached patch a
try ?

i suspect the CLOSE_THE_SOCKET macro resets errno, and hence the confusing
error message
e.g. failed: Error 0 (0)

FWIW, master is also affected.

Cheers,

Gilles

I have tried with a oob_tcp_if_include setting so that there is now only 1
interface.
Even with just one interface and -mt=yes in both LDFLAGS and
wrapper-ldflags I *still* getting messages like

[pcp-j-20:11470] mca_oob_tcp_accept: accept() failed: Error 0 (0).

A process or daemon was unable to complete a TCP connection

This is usually caused by a firewall on the remote host. Please
check that any firewall (e.g., iptables) has been disabled and
try again.

I am getting less certain that my speculation about thread-safe libs is
correct.

 A little more reading finds that...

Docs says that one needs "-mt" without the "=yes".
That will work for both old and new compilers, where "-mt=yes" chokes
older ones.

Also, man pages say "-mt" must come before "-lpthread" in the link command.

 7. Linkage issue on Solaris-11 reported by Paul Hargrove. Missing the
multi-threaded C libraries, apparently need "-mt=yes" in both compile and
link. Need someone to investigate.


The lack of multi-thread libraries is my SPECULATION.

The fact that configuring with LDFLAGS=-mt=yes did not help may or may
not prove anything.
I didn't see them in "mpicc -show" and so maybe they needed to be in
wrapper-ldflags instead.
My time this week is quite limited, but I can "fire an forget" tests of
any tarballs you provide.
