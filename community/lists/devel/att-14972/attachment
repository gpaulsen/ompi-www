<div dir="ltr"><div><div>Thanks Ralf,<br><br></div>for the time being, i just found a workaround<br></div>--mca oob_tcp_if_include eth0<br><div><div><div class="gmail_extra"><br></div><div class="gmail_extra">Generally speaking, is openmpi doing the wiser thing ?<br>
</div><div class="gmail_extra">here is what i mean :<br></div><div class="gmail_extra">the cluster i work on (4k+ nodes) each node has two ip interfaces :<br></div><div class="gmail_extra"> * eth0 (gigabit ethernet) : because of the cluster size, several subnets are used.<br>
</div><div class="gmail_extra"> * ib0 (IP over IB) : only one subnet<br></div><div class="gmail_extra">i can easily understand such a large cluster is not so common, but on the other hand i do not believe the IP configuration (subnetted gigE and single subnet IPoIB) can be called exotic.<br>
<br></div><div class="gmail_extra">if nodes from different eth0 subnets are used, and if i understand correctly your previous replies, orte will &quot;discard&quot; eth0 because nodes cannot contact each other &quot;directly&quot;.<br>
</div><div class="gmail_extra">directly means the nodes are not on the same subnet. that being said, they can communicate via IP thanks to IP routing (i mean IP routing, i do *not* mean orte routing).<br>that means orte communications will use IPoIB which might not be the best thing to do since establishing an IPoIB connection can be long (especially at scale *and* if the arp table is not populated)<br>
<br></div><div class="gmail_extra">is my understanding correct so far ?<br><br></div><div class="gmail_extra">bottom line, i would have expected openmpi uses eth0 regardless IP routing is required, and ib0 is simply not used (or eventually used as a fallback option)<br>
</div><div class="gmail_extra"><br></div><div class="gmail_extra">this leads to my next question : is the current default ok ? if not should we change it and how ?<br></div><div class="gmail_extra">/*<br>imho :<br> - IP routing is not always a bad/slow thing<br>
 - gigE can sometimes be better than IPoIB)<br>*/<br><br></div><div class="gmail_extra">i am fine if at the end :<br>- this issue is fixed<br>- we decide it is up to the sysadmin to make --mca oob_tcp_if_include eth0 the default if this is really thought to be best for the cluster. (and i can try to draft a faq if needed)<br>
