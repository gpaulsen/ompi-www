Hello<br><br>I&#39;m in the midst of writing a BTL component, all is going well although today I ran into something unexpected. In the mca_btl_base_module_add_procs_fn_t function, I&#39;m trying to call mca_oob_tcp_send_nb() which is returning -12 (ORTE_ERR_UNREACH). Is this normal or have I done something wrong? Is there a way around this? It would be great if I could call this function in that particular area of code.<br>
<br>Kind regards<br>Tim Hayes<br>
