Well we actually use a patched version of SLURM, 2.2.0-pre8. It is
planned to submit the modifications made internally at CSCS for the
next SLURM release in November. We implement ALPS support based on the
basic architecture of SLURM.<br>
SLURM is only used to do the ALPS ressource allocation. We then use
mpirun based on the portals and on the alps libaries.<br>
We don't use mca parameters to direct selection and the alps RAS is
automatically well selected.<br>

something? You are using ALPS as the resource manager doing the
allocation, and then using SLURM as the launcher (instead of ALPS)?

  </div>
  <div>That's a combination we've never seen or heard about. I suspect
our module selection logic would be confused by such a combination -
are you using mca params to direct selection?</div>

    <div text="#000000" bgcolor="#ffffff">Hi,<br>
    <br>
We've recently installed OpenMPI on one of our Cray XT5 machines, here
at CSCS. This machine uses SLURM for launching jobs.<br>
Doing an salloc defines this environment variable:<big><br>
    </big><small><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><big>&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BASIL_RESERVATION_ID<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reservation ID on Cray systems running ALPS/BASIL
only.</big><br>
    </font></small><br>
Since the alps ras module tries to find a variable called
OMPI_ALPS_RESID which is set using a script, we thought that for SLURM
systems it would be a good idea to directly integrate this
BASIL_RESERVATION_ID variable in the code, rather than using a script.
The small patch is attached.<br>
