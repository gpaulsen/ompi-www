<div dir="ltr">My experience with DMA engines located on the other side of a PCI-e 16x gen3 bus from the cpus is that for a couple of ranks doing large<div>transfers between each other on a node, using the DMA engine looks good.  But once there are multiple ranks exchanging data (like up to 32 ranks on a dual socket haswell node, not using HT),  using the DMA engine of the NIC is not such a good idea.</div><div><br></div><div>Howard</div><div><br></div></div><div class="gmail_extra"><br><div class="gmail_quote">2015-03-11 10:57 GMT-06:00 Nathan Hjelm <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:hjelmn@lanl.gov" target="_blank">hjelmn@lanl.gov</a>&gt;</span>:<br><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex"><br>
Definitely a side-effect though it could be beneficial in some cases as<br>
the RDMA engine in the HCA may be faster than using memcpy (larger than<br>
a certain size). I don&#39;t know how to best fix this as I need all RDMA<br>
capable BTLs to listed for RMA. I though about adding another list to<br>
track BTLs that have both RMA and atomics but that would increase the<br>
memory footprint of Open MPI by a factor of nranks.<br>

&gt;    I am noticing that the openib BTL will also be used for on-node<br>
&gt;    communication even though the sm (or smcuda) BTL is also available. I<br>
&gt;    think with the aforementioned change that the openib BTL is listed as an<br>
&gt;    available BTL that supports RDMA. While looking through the debugger and<br>
&gt;    looking at the bml_endpoint, it appears that the sm BTL is listed as the<br>
&gt;    eager and send BTL, but the openib is listed as the RDMA btl. Looking at<br>
&gt;    the logic in pml_ob1_sendreq.h, it looks like we can end up selecting the<br>
&gt;    openib btl for some of the communication. I ran with some various<br>
&gt;    verbosity and saw that this was happening. With v1.8, we only appear to<br>
&gt;    use the sm (or smcuda) btl.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;    I am wondering if this was intentional with this change or maybe a side<br>
&gt;    effect.<br>
