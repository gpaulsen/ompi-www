&gt;&gt;&gt; I didn&#39;t follow this entire thread in details, but I am feeling that something is wrong here. The flag fixes your problem indeed, but I think it may break binding too. It&#39;s basically making all &quot;unavailable resources&quot; available. So the binding code may end up trying to bind processes on cores that it can&#39;t actually use.<br>

&gt; I&#39;m not sure I follow here -- which binding code are you referring to; that in hwloc, or that in OMPI?<br>
</div><div class="im">&gt; My understanding of what we should be doing is to compare the output bitmask from hwloc_get_cpubind() with the allowed_cpuset on the HWLOC_OBJ_MACHINE.  If where we are bound is less than the allowed cpuset, then the process is bound.<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; Is that correct?<br>
<br>
</div>Yes.<br>
I didn&#39;t know you already used allowed_cpuset instead of cpuset, good to<br>
know.<br>
<div class="im"><br>
&gt; And per Ralph&#39;s question, the allowed_cpuset of HWLOC_OBJ_MACHINE will still be accurate even if we do WHOLE_SYSTEM, right?<br>
<br>
</div>Yes.<br>
<div class="im"><br>
&gt;   E.g., if some external agent creates a Linux cpuset for a process, then even if we specify WHOLE_SYSTEM, the allowed_cpuset on OBJ_MACHINE will still accurately reflect the PU&#39;s are in the Linux cpuset where this process is running.<br>

<br>
</div>Yes.<br>
<br>
<br>
But you&#39;re talking about &quot;am I bound?&quot; here. My concern was &quot;how does<br>
OMPI bind processes?&quot;.<br>
If WHOLE_SYSTEM is passed, you may get more objects in your topology<br>
(most objects with allowed_cpuset=0 are removed when the flag is not<br>
set). So things like get_nbobjs_by_type() return larger values when you<br>
pass the flag. So you can&#39;t rely of those values when distributing the<br>
processes among the available cores for instance. Does the OMPI binding<br>
code handle this?<br></blockquote><div><br>Yes, we do - because we also allow a user to specify a restricted cpuset for us to use, I automatically filter all cpusets at the beginning of time to create an &quot;available&quot; set for our internal use. This is the set I scan when looking at the number of objects available to us.<br>
<br>Of course, if a developer doesn&#39;t use our internal utilities to get those numbers, they could do something wrong. :-)<br><br>All that said, I think using the WHOLE_SYSTEM flag is actually incorrect. We don&#39;t need to do that as the problem Nadia identified is better solved by correcting the current logic. I&#39;m working on that now - unfortunately, the only slurm machine I can access doesn&#39;t have slurm&#39;s affinity module activated.<br>
