Greetings!<br><br>I ran into errors when using Open MPI&#39;s checkpoint restart functionality. After debugging the application(ompi-restart) I found <br>few variables overflow when running MPI application with more than 128 processes. I identified the places that cause an <br>
overflow and changed the definition of the concerned variables.<br><br>I have attached a detailed bug-report with the mail describing the error scenario and changes which I feel should be made.<br>The patch files corresponding to 2 files which need to be changed are attached too.<br>
<br>I request the community to review the changes and incorporate them in the code in an appropriate way.<br>Please let me know if more  information is need about this.<br><br>Thank you.<br>Kishor Kharbas<br>
