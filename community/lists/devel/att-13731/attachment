&gt; Keep in mind that I have no specific reason to think pgi-10 should be accepted for building mpi_f08.<br>
&gt; My only observation was that it seemed to be rejected w/ less configure testing than was applied to accept 8.0 and 9.0.<br>
<br>
Got it.<br>
<br>
I see the reason, and it&#39;s weird.<br>
<br>
PGI 8 and 9 support Fortran IGNORE TKR syntax, and it looks like PGI 10 does not.  Truly odd.<br>
<br>
Do you have the PGI 11 compiler?  I thought someone said earlier that mpi_f08 worked with their PGI 11 compiler (which means that ignore TKR came back in PGI 11 -- maybe it was just a bug in your rev of PGI 10?).<br>
