      <br>
      I really appreciate you guys looking into this! At least now I
      know that there isn't a better way to run mpi jobs. Probably worth
      looking into LSF again..<br>
      <br>

      <div dir="ltr">I took a brief gander at the OpenLava source code,
        and a couple of things jump out. First, OpenLava is a batch
        scheduler and only supports batch execution - there is no
        interactive command for "run this job". So you would have to
        "bsub" mpirun regardless.
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div>Once you submit the job, mpirun can certainly read the
          local allocation via the environment. However, we cannot use
          the OpenLava internal functions to launch the daemons or
          processes as the code is GPL2, and thus has a viral
          incompatible license. Ordinarily, we get around that by just
          executing the interactive job execution command, but OpenLava
          doesn't have one.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div>So we'd have no other choice but to use ssh to launch the
          daemons on the remote nodes. This is exactly what the provided
          openmpi wrapper script that comes with OpenLava already does.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div>Bottom line: I don't see a way to do any deeper integration
          minus the interactive execution command. If OpenLava had a way
          of getting an allocation and then interactively running jobs,
          we could support what you requested. This doesn't seem to be
          what they are intending, unless I'm missing something (the
          documentation is rather incomplete).</div>

Hi Marc,

OpenLava is based on a pretty old version of LSF (4.x if i remember
correctly)
and i do not think LSF had support for parallel jobs tight integration
at that time.

my understanding is that basically, there is two kind of direct
integration :
- mpirun launch: mpirun spawns orted via the API provided by the batch
manager
- direct launch: the mpi tasks are launched directly from the
script/command line and no mpirun/orted is involved
 at that time, it works with SLURM and possibly other PMI capable batch
manager

i think OpenLava simply gets a list of hosts from the environment, build
a machinefile, pass it to mpirun that spawns orted with ssh, so this is
really loose integration.

OpenMPI is based on plugins, so as long as the queing system provides an
API to start/stop/kill tasks, mpirun launch should not
be a huge effort.

Are you aware of such an API provided by OpenLava ?

Cheers,

Gilles

I have recently started to wonder how hard it would be to add support for queuing systems to the tight integration function of OpenMPI (unfortunately, I am not a developer myself). Specifically, we are working with OpenLava (<a moz-do-not-send="true" href="http://www.openlava.org/" target="_blank">www.openlava.org</a>), which is based on an early version of Lava/LSF and open source. It&#8217;s proven quite useful in environments where some level of LSF compatibility is needed, but without actually paying for a (rather pricey) LSF license. 

Given that openLava shares quite a bit of DNA with LSF, I was wondering how hard it would be to add OL tight integration support to OpenMPI. Currently, OL enables OpenMPI jobs through a wrapper script, but that&#8217;s obviously not ideal and doesn&#8217;t work for some programs that have MPI support built-in (and thus expect to be able to just execute mpirun). 

Any thoughts on this would be greatly appreciated!

Regards,

Marc
