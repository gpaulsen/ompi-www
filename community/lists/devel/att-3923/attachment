Hi,<br><br>What are the meanings of the PML names OB1, DR and CM? The paper &quot;An evaluation of Open MPI&#39;s Matching Transport Layer on the Cray XT&quot; says that they don&#39;t have any special meaning, but here (<a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/papers/workshop-2006/wed_01_pt2pt.pdf">http://www.open-mpi.org/papers/workshop-2006/wed_01_pt2pt.pdf</a>) I saw that DR stands for &quot;Data Reliability&quot;. It&#39;s correct?<br>
<br>Thanks,<br>Caciano<br>
