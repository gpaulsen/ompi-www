There will be a BoF at the July ISC’15 to discuss possible formation of a new open source community focused on providing a more streamlined, automated way of validating HPC software configurations. Basically, the notion is that the community would develop/provide fools for automating the validation process, a procedure for submitting packages for validation, and a database that people can use to check for version compatibility between packages.</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">The BoF description and time is given here:</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class=""><a href="http://www.isc-events.com/isc15_ap/sessiondetails.htm?t=session&amp;o=207&amp;a=select" class="">http://www.isc-events.com/isc15_ap/sessiondetails.htm?t=session&amp;o=207&amp;a=select</a></div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">More discussion on this proposal will take place at SC’15 as well, for interested parties who cannot attend at ISC.</div><div class="">Ralph</div><div class=""><br class=""></div></body></html>
