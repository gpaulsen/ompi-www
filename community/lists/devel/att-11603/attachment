<div style="direction: ltr;font-family: Tahoma;color: #000000;font-size: 10pt;">Hi,
<div><br>
</div>
<div>I'm trying to run with CMA support, but process_vm_readv is failing with EPERM when trying to use it as a regular user (everything seems to work fine as root). I've looked around for some solutions, but I can't seem to find what I'm looking for. The documentation
 states that the target and source processes need to have the same GID and UID to work properly. It appears that they do, so my feeling is that I'm missing something.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Any help is greatly appreciated.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>

</div>
<div>Sam</div>
