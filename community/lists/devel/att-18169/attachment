<div dir="ltr">Okay, so each orte-submit is reporting job has launched, which means the hang is coming while waiting to hear the job completed. Are you sure that orte-dvm believes the job has completed? In other words, when you say that you observe the job as completing, are you basing that on some output from orte-dvm, or because the procs have exited, or...?<div><br></div><div>I can send you a patch tonight that would cause orte-dvm to emit a &quot;job completed&quot; message when it determines each job has terminated - might help us take the next step. I&#39;m wondering if orte-dvm thinks the job is still running, and the race condition is in that area (as opposed to being in orte-submit itself)</div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div><div class="gmail_extra"><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Wed, Oct 14, 2015 at 1:01 PM, Mark Santcroos <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:mark.santcroos@rutgers.edu" target="_blank">mark.santcroos@rutgers.edu</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex">Hi Ralph,<br>

&gt; I wonder if they might be getting duplicate process names if started quickly enough. Do you get the &quot;job has launched&quot; message (orte-submit outputs a message after orte-dvm responds that the job launched)?<br>
<br>
</span>Based on the output below I would say that both columns with IDs are unique.<br>
