<div dir="ltr"><br>Hello,<br>We are trying port Open MPI to a new operating system, called EPOS, but our main problem at the moment is that this operating system is not POSIX compatible. <br>Our question is there some way to know what are the OS dependencies of Open MPI? <br>

Is there a porting manual of Open MPI?<br><div>Is there a documentation for ORTE and OPAL?</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Thanks!</div></div>
