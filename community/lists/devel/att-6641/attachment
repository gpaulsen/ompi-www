  </pre> </blockquote> Okay, so let me point out a second distinction from MVAPICH:&nbsp; the default policy would be to spread out over sockets.<br> <br> Let's say you have two sockets, with four cores each.&nbsp; Let's say you submit two four-core jobs.&nbsp; The first job would put two processes on the first socket and two processes on the second.&nbsp; The second job would do the same.&nbsp; The loading would be even.<br> <br> I'm not saying there couldn't be problems.&nbsp; It's just that MVAPICH2 (at least what I looked at) has multiple shortfalls.&nbsp; The binding is to fill up one socket after another (which decreases memory bandwidth per process and increases chances of collisions with other jobs) and binding is to core (increasing chances of oversubscribing cores).&nbsp; The proposed OMPI behavior distributes over sockets (improving memory bandwidth per process and reducing collisions with other jobs) and binding is to sockets (reducing changes of oversubscribing cores, whether due to other MPI jobs or due to multithreaded processes).&nbsp; So, the proposed OMPI behavior mitigates the problems.<br> <br> It would be even better to have binding selections adapt to other bindings on the system.<br> <br> In any case, regardless of what the best behavior is, I appreciate the point about changing behavior in the middle of a stable release.&nbsp; Arguably, leaving significant performance on the table in typical situations is a bug that warrants fixing even in the middle of a release, but I won't try to settle that debate here.<br></div></blockquote><div><br></div>I think the problem here, Eugene, is that performance benchmarks are far from the typical application.
