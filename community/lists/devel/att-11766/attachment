I would like to fix the 2GB limit in the ROMIO code... and that's why<br>
I am asking! :-D<br>

&gt; Hi Rayson,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Just seen this.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; In the end we've worked around it, by creating successive views of the file<br>
&gt; that are all else than 2GB and then offsetting them to eventually read in<br>
&gt; everything. It's a bit of a pain to keep track of, but it works at the<br>
&gt; moment.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I was intending on following your hints and trying to fix the bug myself,<br>
&gt; but I've been short on time so haven't gotten around to it yet.<br>

&gt; Hi Eric,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Sounds like it's also related to this problem reported by Scinet back in<br>
&gt; July:<br>
&gt;<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; And I think I found the issue, but I still have not followed up with<br>
&gt; the ROMIO guys yet. And I was not sure if Scinet was waiting for the<br>
&gt; fix or not - next time I visit U of Toronto, I will see if I can visit<br>
&gt; the Scinet office and meet with the Scinet guys!<br>
