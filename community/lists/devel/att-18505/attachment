<p dir="ltr">I would prefer improving the faq rather than adding yet more complexity in this area.  The way things go you would add this feature then someone else with a different use case would complain we had broken something for them.  Then we would add another mca param to disable the new tm less module etc.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I think the faq should be more explicit about configury options required for orte/resource manager integration feature to work.  </p>

there was a question about mtt on the mtt mailing list <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/mtt-users/2016/01/0840.php" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/mtt-users/2016/01/0840.php</a><br>
<br>
after a few emails (some offline) it seems that was a configuration issue.<br>
the user is running PBSPro and it seems OpenMPI was not configured with the tm module<br>
(e.g. tm is not included in the default location, and he did not configure with --with-tm=/.../pbspro)<br>
<br>
in this case, the tm module is not built, and when a job runs under PBSPro without any hostfile,<br>
the job runs on one node only.<br>
in order to make this easier to diagnose, what about always building the tm module :<br>
- if tm is found by configury, build the OpenMPI tm modules as usual<br>
- if tm is not found by configury, build a dumb module that will issue a warning or abort<br>
  if a job is ran under PBS/torque<br>
  (e.g. some PBS specific environment variable are defined)<br>
<br>
of course, the spec of this &quot;dumb&quot; module can be improved, for example<br>
- add a MCA parameter to disable the warning<br>
- issue the warning only if there is more that one node in the job *and* no machinefile nor host list was passed to the mpirun command line<br>
<br>
Any thoughts ?<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
<br>
Gilles<br>
