Your lament is duly noted and we are happy to work with you to come to (yet another) happy compromise. It&#39;s unfortunate that the issue wasn&#39;t raised during the dev meeting when these decisions were made (you were sitting right next to me while I discussed this out loud with Jeff and Ralph.) At the time, it seemed all interested parties had expressed their concern and voiced their opinion on the matter, and the implementation you see in the trunk today, including the decision to deprecate the &quot;-x&quot; option, was the generally agreed upon consensus. <br>

&gt;&gt; we have a strong use-case for list of env variables passed as mca params.(it was presented and discussed in the past).<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I&#39;m not disputing your use case for &quot;mca_base_env_list&quot;.  I&#39;m only lamenting the crapification of our mpirun user interface.  We had an earlier change along these lines based on similar reasoning: the easy-to-use-and-remember &quot;--pernode N&quot; was replaced with &quot;--map-by ppr:N:node&quot;, which I cannot ever seem to remember.<br>

<br>
</div>Same reason, I&#39;m afraid - no way to do the mapping<br>

&gt;&gt; we can rename opal_base_envlist as &quot;-mca x var=val&quot; for consistency.<br>
&gt;&gt; also, &quot;-x&quot; param now is just an alias for &quot;-mca opal_base_envlist var=val&quot; - so, we can keep it (w/o deprecation warning) as it re-uses same infra.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Mike, will you make this change?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Thanks,<br>
&gt; -Dave<br>
