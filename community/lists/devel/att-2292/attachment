<br>
<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">I am a complete newbie to Open MPI internals
and just began browsing the code and reading up on slides and papers. From
what I have read, I learned that I have to create a new component. What
I do not know is how to make MPI aware of it or should I say make MPI open
and select my component. I found a set of slides that briefly went over
adding components. For example, it briefly described that I must add PARAM_INIT_FILE
and PARAM_CONFIG_FILES options in configure.params, but I'm not sure what
these mean. Does anybody know of any tutorials/documents that could help
me with this?</font>
<br>
<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">Any help is greatly appreciated.</font>
