Hi Brian,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; I got another problem in running an MPI job through XGrid. During the execution of this MPI job it will call Xlib functions (i.e. XOpenDisplay()) to open an X window.&nbsp; The XOpenDisplay() function call failed (return &quot;null&quot;), it can not open a display no matter how many processors that I requested. 
<br><br>However, when I tuned off the xgrid controller, I used &quot;mpirun -n 4 &quot; to start the job again, four X windows opened properly, but four processes were all running on the local machine instead of on any remote nodes.&nbsp; 
<br><br>I have also tested to use &quot;ssh -x&quot; from a terminal of my local machine to login to any other node in the cluster&nbsp; to run the job (I have the copies of the same job on all nodes and in the same path), the X window can display on my local machine&nbsp; properly. I know it is &quot;-x&quot; option set up the environment properly for starting the xwindow. If only use &quot;ssh&quot; without &quot;-x&quot; option, it won&#39;t work.
<br><br>I am wondering why the xwindow can not open if the job is started through Xgrid.&nbsp; How does the Xgrid controller contact to each agent node? <br><br>Is there anyone who has seen a similar problem?&nbsp; <br> <br>I have installed X11 and OpenMPI on all 8 mac mini nodes in my cluster, and have also tested running an&nbsp; MPI job,&nbsp; which&nbsp; has no X window function calls, through XGrid, it worked perfectly fine on all nodes.
<br><br>Thanks a lot for any suggestions!<br><br>Jane<br><br>&nbsp;<br>
