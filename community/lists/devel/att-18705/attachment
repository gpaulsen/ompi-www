This is going back to a question that I myself asked recently, and I am now finding out the answer the hard way!<br><br></div>Is there any way that all the internal functions, not explicitly declared &#39;static&#39; can be made visible?<br><br></div>Thanks<br></div>Durga<br></div><div class="gmail_extra"><br clear="all"><div><div class="gmail_signature">Life is complex.
