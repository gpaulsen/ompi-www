      i understand, i will now work on a better way to figure out the
      required flags<br>
      <br>
      the latest nightly snapshot does not include the commit i
      mentionned, and i think<br>
      it is worth giving it a try (to be 100.0% sure ...)<br>
      <br>
      can you please do that tomorrow ?<br>
      <br>
      in the mean time, if we (well Ralph indeed) want to release 1.8.4,
      then simply restore<br>
      the two config files i mentionned.<br>
      <br>

      <pre>Gilles,

If I have done my testing correctly (not 100% sure) then adding
&quot;-D_REENTRANT&quot; was NOT sufficient, where &quot;-mt&quot; was.

I can at least test 1 tarball with one set of configure args each evening.
Anything more than that I cannot commit to.

My scripts are capable of grabbing the v1.8 nightly instead of the rc if
that helps.

 Ralph,

i think that will not work.

here is the full story :

once upon a time, on solaris, we did not try to compile pthread&#39;ed app
without any special parameters.
that was a minor annoyance on solaris 10 with old gcc : configure passed a
flag (-pthread if i remember correctly)
that was not supported by gcc (at that time) and generated tons of
warnings.
when i asked &quot;why don&#39;t we just try no special parameter on solaris ?&quot; i
was replied this is because looong time ago
openmpi used solaris lwp, so solaris was &quot;special&quot; anyway.
since solaris is able to build (compile+link) a pthread&#39;ed app without any
flags, i removed the special case for solaris,
and no flag was used.
then i noticed that lead to bad code (errno is global instead of per
thread specific), so you automatically added -D_REENTRANT
on solaris (e.g. if the __sun__ macro is defined)
then i found that solarisstudio compilers do not define the __sun__macro
automatically (__sun and sun are defined) so i improved
the test (e.g. we are on solaris if __sun__ or __sun is defined)
this was merged (yesterday) and is not in rc4

what we should do know is unclear for me ...
is -D_REENTRANT enough for gcc compilers on solaris ?
is -D_REENTRANT *not* enough for solarisstudio compilers on solaris ?
/* if -D_REENTRANT is *not* enough, then we all we have to do is use -mt
since that implies -D_REENTRANT */


a working solution (minus the minor annoyance i described earlier) is to
restore
config/opal_check_os_flavors.m4
config/ompi_config_pthreads.m4

and then i ll find a better way to correctly set the flags that must be
used on solaris

that being said, and based on Paul&#39;s availability, i d rather have a new
tarball (rc5?) tested.
(do we *really* need -mt ? isn&#39;t -D_REENTRANT enough ?)
this tarball must include
<a href="https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi-release/commit/ac8b84ce674b958dbf8c9481b300beeef0548b83" target="_blank">https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi-release/commit/ac8b84ce674b958dbf8c9481b300beeef0548b83</a></div></div>

configury: test the __sun macro to detect solaris OS.


FWIW. i was unable to reproduce the problem on solaris 11 with sunstudio
12.4 even if i do not use -D_REENTRANT *nor* -mt (!)

Cheers,

Gilles

Hi Paul

Can you try the attached patch? It would require running autogen, I fear.
Otherwise, I can add it to the tarball.

 Gilles,

The 1.8.3 test works where the 1.8.4rc4 one fails with identical configure
arguments.

While it may be overkill, I configured 1.8.4rc4 with

   CFLAGS=&quot;-m64 -mt&quot; --with-wrapper-cflags=&quot;-m64 -mt&quot; \
   LDFLAGS=&quot;-mt&quot; --with-wrapper-ldflags=&quot;-mt&quot;

The resulting run worked!

So, I very strongly suspect that the problem will be resolved if one
restores the configure logic that my previous email shows has vanished
(since that would restore &quot;-mt&quot; to CFLAGS and wrapper cflags).

 My 1.8.3 build has not completed.
HOWEVER, I can already see a key difference in the configure step.

In 1.8.3 &quot;-mt&quot; was added AUTOMATICALLY to CFLAGS by configure:

checking if C compiler and POSIX threads work as is... no - Solaris, not
checked
checking if C++ compiler and POSIX threads work as is... no - Solaris,
not checked
checking if Fortran compiler and POSIX threads work as is... no -
Solaris, not checked
checking if C compiler and POSIX threads work with -pthread... no
checking if C compiler and POSIX threads work with -pthreads... no
checking if C compiler and POSIX threads work with -mt... yes
checking if C++ compiler and POSIX threads work with -pthread... yes
checking if Fortran compiler and POSIX threads work with -pthread... yes

This is not the case in 1.8.4rc4:

checking if C compiler and POSIX threads work as is... yes
checking if C++ compiler and POSIX threads work as is... yes
checking if Fortran compiler and POSIX threads work as is... yes


So, it looks like a chunk of Solaris-specific configure logic was LOST.
