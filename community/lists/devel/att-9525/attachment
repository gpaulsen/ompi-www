I know for sure that at some point OpenFabrics OpenSM has forked
and was used as a basis for *some* Solaris SM, which possibly
will preserve the same headers. The MAD format has to stay the
same to provide interoperability, and I doubt that someone renamed
MAD fields just for fun.
So the questions is, what header and what package contain there
structures.

    Note there is no SM delivered with Solaris specifically.&nbsp; So there
    are no SM specific header files.<br>
    AFAIK, we rely on remote SM's whether it is one running on a switch
    or on another node (like OpenSM running on Linux).<br>
    So relying on OpenSM source headers existing on Solaris is probably
    a bad plan.<br>

    However, it sounds like the existance of ib_types.h might help us
    which I have answered in a previous email that it does exist.<br>

Other question is do Oracle folks care about IB QoS and torus/mesh
topologies w.r.t. OMPI, because otherwise the dynamic SL is irrelevant.

AFAIK Solaris doesn't use OpenFabrics OpenSM - it has a separate
subnet manager, so I can't assume that it has.
So right now the dynamic SL will probably not work on Solaris
(though it won't break the compilation).

These have IB Verbs support, but there is no such header. In fact, /usr/include/inifiband has no sub-directories.

(That is, no such header and not even any subdirectories on a very recent version of Solaris 11: snv_168.)

            <pre wrap="">Makes sense. But I believe that these Solaris installations
just don't have Subnet Manager, so they are not supposed to
have these headers anyway. What I don't know is what headers
are installed as part of the SM installation.
Does anybody have a Solaris machine with Subnet Manager?
