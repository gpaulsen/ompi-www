    And while we are looking at examples/Makefile on Solaris-10, why are
    the F77 examples getting built w/ mpif90?<br>
    Because w/ the Solaris make setting FC also silently sets F77 (yes,
    I am NOT kidding)!<br>
    So, reordering the F77= and FC= lines in Makefile resolves that
    mis-behavior.<br>
    <br>
    Attached is my patch to fix both F77/FC and the "better" ompi_info
    queries mentioned in my previous post.<br>
    This REPLACES the patch in the previous post.<br>

      The addition of java did NOT break anything, but exposed a
      pre-existing problem which&nbsp; was not evident in my prior testing
      because all language bindings were being build prior to adding
      java.
      <br>
      <br>
      The attached patch resolves the problem in my (admittedly minimal)
      testing with the smallest possible change.
      <br>
      However an entirely different avoids both "test" and "true" and
      simply looks like:
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; @ if ompi_info --parsable | grep bindings:cxx:yes
      &gt;/dev/null; then
      <br>
      I have *also* tested that approach, and it works fine too.
      <br>
      <br>
      I *did* warn that the introduction of the java bindings would
      bring collateral damage.
      <br>
      I just didn't anticipate encountering it personally.
