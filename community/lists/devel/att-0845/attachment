Hi,<br><br>I'm just beginning to evaluate Open MPI for usage in a research project.<br><br>Is the &quot;process fault tolerance&quot; aka FT-MPI semantics being worked on? Or what is the roadmap for this feature? Will it be one of the frameworks in the MCA?
<br><br>Thanks for your time. If there's a better place to ask these questions, please redirect me.<br><br>-- <br> Israel Hsu<br> israelhsu at gmail dot com
