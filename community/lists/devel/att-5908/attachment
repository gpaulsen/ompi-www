As Rayson guessed, I am using Hadoop. &nbsp;I actually didn&#8217;t know that OpenMPI was integrated with Torque but we&#8217;re moving away from using Torque. &nbsp;In terms of making the code public, I&#8217;ll have to double check, but there weren&#8217;t too many changes involved.<BR>

&gt; I&#8217;m currently working in an environment where I cannot use SSH to <BR>
&gt; launch child processes. &nbsp;Instead, the process with rank 0 skips the <BR>
&gt; ssh_child function in plm_rsh_module.c and the child processes are <BR>
&gt; all started at the same time on different machines. &nbsp;Coordination is <BR>
&gt; done with static jobids and ports. &nbsp;I have sucessfully modified the <BR>
&gt; code to get the hello_c example working.<BR>
<BR>
Excellent. &nbsp;What mechanism are you using to start your jobs? &nbsp;Would it <BR>
be easier to fork the rsh plm into your own plugin? &nbsp;Is this code you <BR>
can share with the community?<BR>
<BR>
&gt; However, I&#8217;m having problems with inter-process communication when <BR>
&gt; using MPI_Bcast. &nbsp;Is there something else that I&#8217;m obviously missing?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The PLM just starts up jobs -- other plugins are used for MPI <BR>
communications. &nbsp;E.g., the TCP BTL is probably what you're using for <BR>
MPI communications. &nbsp;Is that where it's failing?<BR>
