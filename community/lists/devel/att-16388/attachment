      <br>
      i previously tested with slurm 2.6.0, and it complained about the
      slurm_verbose symbol that is defined in libslurm.so<br>
      so with slurm 2.6.0, RTLD_GLOBAL or relinking is ok<br>
      <br>
      now i tested with slurm 2.6.6 and it complains about the
      slurm_auth_get_arg_desc symbol, and this symbol is not<br>
      defined in any dynamic library. it is internally defined in the
      static libcommon.a library, which is used to build the slurm
      binaries.<br>
      <br>
      as far as i understand, auth_munge.so can only be invoked from a
      slurm binary, which means it cannot be invoked from an mpi
      application<br>
      even if it is linked with libslurm, libpmi, ...<br>
      <br>
      that looks like a slurm design issue that the slurm folks will
      take care of.<br>
      <br>

Jeff,

FWIW, you can read my analysis of what is going wrong at
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/pmix-devel/2014/11/0293.php">http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/pmix-devel/2014/11/0293.php</a> <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/pmix-devel/2014/11/0293.php">&lt;http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/pmix-devel/2014/11/0293.php&gt;</a>

bottom line, i agree this is a slurm issue (slurm plugin should depend
on libslurm, but they do not, yet)

a possible workaround would be to make the pmi component a "proxy" that
dlopen with RTLD_GLOBAL the "real" component in which the job is done.
that being said, the impact is quite limited (no direct launch in slurm
with pmi1, but pmi2 works fine) so it makes sense not to work around
someone else problem.
and that being said, configure could detect this broken pmi1 and not
build pmi1 support or print a user friendly error message if pmi1 is used.

any thoughts ?

Cheers,

Gilles

(sidenote: this is moot, so ignore this if you want: with this explanation, I'm still not sure how RTLD_GLOBAL fixes the issue)

            <pre wrap="">Easy enough to explain. We link libpmi into the pmix/s1 component. This library is missing the linkage to libslurm that contains the linkage to libauth where munge resides. So when we call a PMI function, libpmi references a call to munge for authentication and hits an &#8220;unresolved symbol&#8221; error.

Moe acknowledges the error is in Slurm and is fixing the linkages so this problem goes away

              <pre wrap="">Can you explain what is happening?

I ask because I'm not sure I understand the problem such that using RTLD_GLOBAL would fix it.  I.e., even if libpmi1.so isn't linked against its dependencies properly, that shouldn't cause a problem if OMPI components A and B are both linked against libpmi1.so, and then A is loaded, and then B is loaded.

...or perhaps we can just discuss this on the call tomorrow?
