Although I am yet to become an authority in the world of openMPI, I will give you pointers to start.<br>I assume that you plan to submit the jobs without any scheduler (e.g Maui/torque combination and stuff) and running the jobs simply by such a command "mpirun -np 2 -host node-00,node-01 uptime". So to get started in the easiest way is to have openmpi installed on third machine as well. The third machine (lets call it headnode) needs to have mpirun and other related stuff. Please note this is just the basic stuff and for a production cluster you may need other configurations. <br><br><span>A very nice and detailed faq section exists at &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a target="_blank"

Hi all,<br><br>I have three linux machines which are connected to each other via a <br>router. I have installed Open-MPI on two of them and they seems to work <br>fine. Now I want to submit a job from my third machine to be<br>run on those two machines which have Open-MPI and use two CPUs for this <br>job. Is there any special settings that I should do or any link which <br>can help?<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Danesh<br><br>_______________________________________________<br>devel mailing list<br><a ymailto="mailto:devel@open-mpi.org" href="mailto:devel@open-mpi.org">devel@open-mpi.org</a><br><a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/devel" target="_blank">http://www.open-mpi.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/devel</a><br></div><br></div></div><br>
