<div dir="ltr">Be aware that we removed SCTP from the 1.7 release series because of its unknown state of repair - I don&#39;t believe anyone has tested it in quite some time, and nobody has been maintaining it so far as we know. Not saying it won&#39;t work - just saying that I don&#39;t think we know :-/<br>

&gt; I was wondering what the current state of iWARP development is.<br>
<br>
</div>Open MPI&#39;s iWARP support is part of the &quot;openib&quot; BTL (so named because OpenFabrics used to be known as OpenIB, before iWARP joined, and we never changed the name of our plugin after OFA became OFA).<br>

<div class="im"><br>
&gt; There are some features we’re interested in, and from what I can tell the iWARP RFCs/Internet Drafts haven’t caught up to related developments.<br>
<br>
</div>As George mentioned, we deleted the SCTP plugin from the 1.7 release branch -- but that&#39;s a standalone SCTP plugin, which is not what I think you&#39;re asking about it.<br>
<div class="im"><br>
&gt; Part of our interest is in using SCTP as the LLP for iWARP, and updating that adaptation to the latest SCTP work.<br>
<br>
</div>Gotcha.<br>
<div class="im"><br>
&gt; For instance:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; RFC 6458 – SCTP authentication<br>
&gt; RFC 6458 – SCTP out-of-order delivery<br>
&gt; RFC 6458 – SCTP association end-point address changes<br>
&gt; RFC 6458 – SCTP Receive Information<br>
&gt; RFC 6458 – SCTP partially reliable delivery<br>
&gt; RFC 6458 – SCTP key management<br>
&gt; RFC 5061 – SCTP Dynamic address reconfiguration (useful for hot NIC swaps in a high availability environment)<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; We’d also like to see load-sharing in multipath environments, and sender-side traffic shaping support.<br>
<br>
</div>Sounds nifty.<br>
<div class="im"><br>
&gt; From what I can tell, the iWARP SCTP work that’s been done predates RFC-6458, and hence I’m assuming it’s aligned to RFC-5043.<br>
<br>
</div>Sure...?<br>
<div class="im"><br>
&gt; Other questions I have:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Has this code been tested extensively on non-x86 platforms?  What about IA64, PPC64, ARM7, or MIPS 7K?<br>
<br>
</div>Doubtful.  The openib BTL is known to work with IB and iWARP on a variety of x86 platforms.  I have no idea, and would kinda doubt, if it has been tested on any of the other platforms you&#39;ve specified.<br>
<div class="im"><br>
&gt; Is anyone doing any code to port SolarFlare OpenOnload stack to support Open MPI’s iWARP?<br>
<br>
</div>Nope.  SF has told me/others that they&#39;re happy just doing their onload TCP through OMPI -- they don&#39;t see the need to do their own OO plugin (but don&#39;t take my word for it; I certainly cannot speak for them -- feel free to ask them yourself).<br>

<div class="im HOEnZb"><br>
&gt; And a minor note… Just looking at the 1.7.3 tarball and grepping for SCTP in it, I find only a few matches, such as this:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; evutil_getaddrinfo_infer_protocols(struct evutil_addrinfo *hints)<br>
&gt; {<br>
&gt; …<br>
&gt; #ifdef IPPROTO_SCTP<br>
&gt;                                 else if (hints-&gt;ai_protocol == IPPROTO_SCTP)<br>
&gt;                                                 hints-&gt;ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM;<br>
&gt; #endif<br>
&gt;                 }<br>
&gt; }<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; And this has me puzzled: SCTP is predominately a SOCK_SEQPACKET, isn’t it? (The whole point of using it and not TCP as a transport is it preserves record boundaries, supports out-of-order delivery and message interleaving, etc.)<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; At least, that’s how it registers itself as a protocol in Linux 3.12 in net/sctp/protocol.c …<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Apologies if there’s a better mailing list for iWARP specific questions. I’m looking at a lot of this stuff for the first time and having to ramp up quickly.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Thanks,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; -Philip<br>
