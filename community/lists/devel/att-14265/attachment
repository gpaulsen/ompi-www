    some additional explanation&nbsp; - it could be a situation when AF_IB is

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've committed the fixes (r30905). It is a problem to detect
      kernel defines (such as AF_IB ), so we have to use AC_RUN_IFELSE
      macro.

        Is it necessary to AC_RUN_IFELSE here?&nbsp; Is AC_CHECK_DECLS not
        sufficient for some reason?
        <br>
        <br>
        It strikes me that this test you currently have in configure.m4
        really should be a run-time test, and that all you need in
        configure.m4 should be an AC_CHECK_DECLS to see if AF_IB exists.
