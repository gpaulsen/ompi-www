This time i am actually facing a problem. I should have send the problem to eventlib mailing list first, but I thought your guys must be more current with what I am doing, so i tried this list first. <br><br>I am trying to port xensockets to openmpi. In principle, I have the framework and everything, but there seems to be a small issue, I cannot get libevent (or OPAL) to give callbacks for receive (or send) for xensockets. I have tried to implement&nbsp; native code&nbsp; for xensockets&nbsp; with libevent library,&nbsp; again the same issue.&nbsp; No&nbsp; call backs! . With normal sockets, callbacks do come easily. <br><br>So question is,&nbsp; do the socket/file descriptors have to have some special mechanism attached to them to support callbacks for
 libevent/opal? i.e some structure/magic?. i.e. maybe the developers of xensockets did not add that callback/interrupt thing at the time of creation. Xensockets is open source, but my knowledge about these issues is limited. So I though some pointer in right direction might be useful. <br><br>Second question is, what if we cannot have the callbacks. What is the recommended way to implement the btl component for such a device? Do we need to do this with event timers?<br><div>&nbsp;</div>Best Regards,<br>Muhammad Atif<div>PS: google was not helpful. :)<br></div></div><br>
