Certainly we need to communicate / advertise / evangelize the improvements in job launch - the largest and most substantial change between the two branches - and provide some best practice guidelines for usage (use direct modex for applications with sparse communication patterns and full modex for dense.)

What &quot;gotchas&quot; do we need to communicate to users?  I.e., what will people upgrading from v1.8.x/v1.10.x be surprised by?<br>

The most obvious one I can think of is mpirun requiring -np when slots are not specified somehow.<br>
<br>
What else do we need to communicate?  It would be nice to avoid the confusion users experienced regarding affinity functionality/options when upgrading from v1.6 -&gt; v1.8 (because we didn&#39;t communicate these changes well, IMHO).<br>
