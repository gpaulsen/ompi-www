Hello again.<div><br></div><div>I was doing some trace into de PML_OB1 files. I start to follow a MPI_Ssend() trying to find where a message is stored (in the sender) if it is not send until the receiver post the recv, but i didn&#39;t find that place. </div>


<div><br></div><div>I&#39;ve noticed that the message to be sent enters in <b>mca_pml_ob1_rndv_completion_request(</b>pml_ob1_sendreq.c<b>) </b>and  the <b>rc = send_request_pml_complete_check(sendreq) </b>returns false when the request hasn&#39;t been completed, but the execution never passes through <b>MCA_PML_OB1_PROGRESS_PENDING,</b> at least, none of the possible options is executed.</div>

<div><br></div><div>So, re-orienting my question: where is stored this message until delivery? and if there any way to know that the receiver goes down? With this information i will be able to detect the failure of the receiver and will try to resend the message to another place.</div>

<div><br></div><div>Thanks again.</div><div><br></div><div>Hugo Meyer<br><br><div class="gmail_quote">2011/11/17 Hugo Daniel Meyer <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:meyer.hugo@gmail.com" target="_blank">meyer.hugo@gmail.com</a>&gt;</span><br>


<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex">Hello @ll.<br><br>I&#39;m doing some changes in the communication framework. Right now i&#39;m working on a &quot;secure&quot; MPI_Send, this send needs to know when an endpoint goes down, and then retry the communication constructing a new endpoint, or at least, overwriting the data of the old endpoint with the new address of the receiver process. Overwriting the data of the endpoint is not a problem anymore, because i&#39;ve done that before.<br>



<br>For example, if we consider a Master/Worker application, where the master sends data to the workers, and  workers start the computation, then, the master posts a send to the worker1 that fails and get restarted in another node and in his new location the worker1 posts the recv to the master&#39;s send. The problem here is that the master post the send when the process was residing in one node, but the process expects the message in another node. I need the sender to realize that the process is now in another node, and retries the communication with a modificated endpoint. Anyone could please tell me where in the send code i can obtain the status of a message that hasn&#39;t been send and resend it to a new location. Also i want to know, where can i obtain information about an endpoint fail?.<br>



<br>Thanks in advance.<span><font color="#888888"><br><br>Hugo<br>
