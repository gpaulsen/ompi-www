&gt; Receiving with such a datatype is illegal in MPI (sending is allowed as the buffer is supposed read only during the operation). In fact having any datatype that span over the same memory region twice is illegal to be used for any receive operations. The reason is simple, an MPI implementation can move the data in any order it wants, and as MPI guaranteed only the FIFO ordering of the matching such a datatype will break the determinism of the application.<br>

</span>George: does the DDT engine check for this kind of condition?  Shouldn&#39;t it refuse the generate a datatype like this?<br>
