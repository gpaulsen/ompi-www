<div><div class="h5"><div dir="ltr">I think Case #1 is only a partial solution, as it only solves the example attached to the ticket. Based on my reading the the tool chapter calling MPI_T_init after MPI_Finalize is legit, and this case is not covered by the patch. But this is not the major issue I have with this patch. From a coding perspective, it makes the initialization of OPAL horribly unnatural, requiring any other layer using OPAL to make a horrible gymnastic just to tear it down correctly (setting opal_init_util_init_extra to the right value).<div>

I vote for solution #1.  Doesn&#39;t change current behavior.  Doesn&#39;t open the door to becoming dependent on availability of<br>
ctor/dtor feature in future toolchains.<br>

&gt; I discussed this over IM with Nathan to try and get a better understanding of the options. Basically, we have two approaches available to us:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 1. my solution resolves the segv problem and eliminates leaks so long as the user calls MPI_Init/Finalize after calling the MPI_T init/finalize functions. This method will still leak memory if the user doesn&#39;t use MPI after calling the MPI_T functions, but does mean that all memory used by MPI will be released upon MPI_Finalize. So if the user program continues beyond MPI, they won&#39;t be carrying the MPI memory footprint with them. This continues our current behavior.<br>


&gt;<br>
&gt; 2. the destructor method, which release the MPI memory footprint upon final program termination instead of at MPI_Finalize. This also solves the segv and leak problems, and ensures that someone calling only the MPI_T init/finalize functions will be valgrind-clean, but means that a user program that runs beyond MPI will carry the MPI memory footprint with them. This is a change in our current behavior.<br>


<br>
Correct. Though the only thing we will carry around until termination is the memory associated with opal/mca/if, opal/mca/event, opal_net, opal_malloc, opal_show_help, opal_output, opal_dss, opal_datatype, and opal_class. Not sure how much memory this is.<br>
