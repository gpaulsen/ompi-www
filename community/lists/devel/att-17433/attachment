<br>
this is a follow-up of a discussion on the user ML started at <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/users/2015/05/26882.php" target="_blank">http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/users/2015/05/26882.php</a><br>
<br>
1) it turns out the dynamic rule filename must be &quot;sorted&quot; :<br>
- rules must be sorted by communicator size<br>
- within a given communicator size, rules must be sorted by message size<br>
<br>
if not, some rules are silently skipped, which is counter intuitive imho.<br>
<br>
<br>
2) the algo picks the rule with the higher communicator size less or equal than the current communicator size (same thing for message size).<br>
The exception is if there are no such rule, the first rule is selected.<br>
for example, if the config file has rules for comm size 4, 8 and 16<br>
comm size 4 =&gt; pick rule for comm size 4<br>
comm size 5 =&gt; pick rule for comm 4<br>
comm size 8 =&gt; pick rule for comm 8<br>
*but*<br>
comm size 2 =&gt; pick rule for comm size 4 (!)<br>
imho, this is also counter intuitive.<br>
i would have expected no rule is picked and the default behaviour is used.<br>
<br>
Same thing applies for message sizes.<br>
<br>
Is this the intended design ?<br>
<br>
1) can be solved by inserting some qsort calls after parsing the config file.<br>
2) can be solved by returning a NULL rule instead of the first rule ( or by automatically inserting a rule for comm size 0 (and message size 0) if no such rule is present in the config file).<br>
<br>
any thoughts ?<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
<br>
Gilles<br>
