<div class="im">&gt; Hi all -<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Mike added a debian/ directory to the top-level of the tree this morning,<br>
&gt; which looks to be helping in building a Debian package.  While I don&#39;t<br>
&gt; mind helping Debian, I&#39;m really against having a debian/ directory in our<br>
&gt; top-level tree.  We have a place for those things (in contrib/).  If<br>
&gt; Debian can&#39;t conform to that requirement, maybe we shouldn&#39;t have Debian<br>
&gt; supportŠ<br>
&gt;<br>
</div>I am sorry but it does not help for a few reasons:<br>
* We, in Debian, are doing several uploads of the same upstream version.<br>
So, we always have to modify debian/<br>
* Our tools are removing automatically debian/ in upstream tarballs<br>
* They would have to be in rootDir/debian/, rootDir/contrib/debian would<br>
not work.<br>
* There are already the Debian packages which are a bit more complete<br>
and tested than the one pushed ;)<br>
