Is it possible that you have two versions of Open MPI in your path  
somewhere and that you might be getting different versions on  
different nodes?  The errors below generally indicate that data was  
received in a totally different format than expected, so I'm just  
kind of guessing as to how one could get to that situation...

Sorry to bother you.
I have installed latest stable version of Open MPI(1.0) on two  
of spider
nodes(s7,s4) for some experiments, but there seems to be  
configuration
error  or something else which I don't understand. After  
installing, as
a test I ran an simple MPI program but it complains with following
errors.
[s4:10685] [0,0,0] ORTE_ERROR_LOG: Pack data mismatch in file
dps_unpack.c at line 121
[s4:10685] [0,0,0] ORTE_ERROR_LOG: Pack data mismatch in file
dps_unpack.c at line 95
Further digging with gdb prints following errors
[s7:07005] ERROR: A daemon on node s4 failed to start as expected.
[s7:07005] ERROR: There may be more information available from
[s7:07005] ERROR: the remote shell (see above).

any clue on what I am doing wrong ?
