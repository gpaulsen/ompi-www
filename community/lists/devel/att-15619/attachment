&gt; I am on the same page with George here - if it&#39;s on the list then support it until its been removed.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I happen to have systems to test, I believe, every supported atomics implementation except for DEC Alpha, and so I did test them all.<br>
<br>
</div>My comment was not intended to indicate that I don&#39;t value your testing contributions, Paul.  I am more concerned that Nathan is wasting time fixing support for an effectively useless platform.  It&#39;s not like this is a case where making the more portable change improves our general correctness on other platforms; it&#39;s a very (&lt;= ARMv5)-specific situation.<br>

<br>
If there&#39;s actually an official list of supported platforms somewhere, then I&#39;ll let Nathan decide whether he wants to submit an RFC to drop ARMv5 support.  I know I&#39;d support it, but I don&#39;t care enough to write an RFC of my own right now.<br>
