 Now that we are binding by default, the issue of #slots and what to do 
when oversubscribed has become a bit more complicated. This isn't a 
problem in managed environments as we are always provided an accurate 
assignment for the #slots, or when -host is used to define the 
allocation since we automatically assume one slot for every time a node 
is named.
</p><p>
The problem arises when a hostfile is used, and the user provides host 
names without specifying the slots= paramater. In these cases, we assign
 slots=1, but automatically allow oversubscription since that number 
isn't confirmed. We then provide a separate parameter by which the user 
can direct that we assign the number of slots based on the sensed 
hardware - e.g., by telling us to set the #slots equal to the #cores on 
each node. However, this has been set to "off" by default.
</p><p>
In order to make this a little less complex for the user, set the 
default such that we automatically set #slots equal to #cores (or #hwt's
 if use_hwthreads_as_cpus has been set) only for those cases where the 
user provides names in a hostfile but does not provide slot information.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
