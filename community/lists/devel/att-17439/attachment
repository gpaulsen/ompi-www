    George,<br>
    <br>
    first i&#39;d like to amend my initial message.<br>
    i previously wrote the same algo is used to parse rules per
    communicator size and per message size.<br>
    this is true, but i missed the part where it is mandatory to define
    a rule for zero size message.<br>
    consequently, a given message is either in an interval or its size
    is more or equal the size of the last rule for a given communicator.<br>
    <br>
    there is no such thing for communicator size.<br>
    for example, if the config file is<br>
    comm size 4 =&gt; rules A<br>
    comm size 8 =&gt; rules B<br>
    communicators of size 2, 4 and 6 will all use rule A.<br>
    this is very intuitive for comm size 4 and 6, but at first glance,
    comm size 2 is in a grey area.<br>
    <br>
    an other option would be to force the rule file to have a rule for
    communicators of size 0 (or 1 or two).<br>
    <br>
    bottom line, the rules must be sorted by comm size and message size
    by design, and that looks fair to me.<br>
    however, there is a grey area for small communicators and i think it
    should be cleared.<br>
    <br>
    Cheers,<br>

                          <br>
                          this is a follow-up of a discussion on the
                          user ML started at <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/users/2015/05/26882.php" target="_blank">http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/users/2015/05/26882.php</a><br>
                          <br>
                          1) it turns out the dynamic rule filename must
                          be &quot;sorted&quot; :<br>
                          - rules must be sorted by communicator size<br>
                          - within a given communicator size, rules must
                          be sorted by message size<br>
                          <br>
                          if not, some rules are silently skipped, which
                          is counter intuitive imho.<br>
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          2) the algo picks the rule with the higher
                          communicator size less or equal than the
                          current communicator size (same thing for
                          message size).<br>
                          The exception is if there are no such rule,
                          the first rule is selected.<br>
                          for example, if the config file has rules for
                          comm size 4, 8 and 16<br>
                          comm size 4 =&gt; pick rule for comm size 4<br>
                          comm size 5 =&gt; pick rule for comm 4<br>
                          comm size 8 =&gt; pick rule for comm 8<br>
                          *but*<br>
                          comm size 2 =&gt; pick rule for comm size 4
                          (!)<br>
                          imho, this is also counter intuitive.<br>
                          i would have expected no rule is picked and
                          the default behaviour is used.<br>
                          <br>
                          Same thing applies for message sizes.<br>
                          <br>
                          Is this the intended design ?<br>
                          <br>
                          1) can be solved by inserting some qsort calls
                          after parsing the config file.<br>
                          2) can be solved by returning a NULL rule
                          instead of the first rule ( or by
                          automatically inserting a rule for comm size 0
                          (and message size 0) if no such rule is
                          present in the config file).<br>
                          <br>
                          any thoughts ?<br>
                          <br>
                          Cheers,<br>
