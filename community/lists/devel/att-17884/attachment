<br>
For some reason that is currently still beyond me, I can&#39;t bind to INADDR_ANY for more than 74 ports on a Cray compute node, without getting EADDRINUSE.<br>
This impacts my use of the oob_tcp_listener.c:create_listen() code on that machine (through means of orte-submit).<br>
<br>
I&#39;ve implemented a proof of concept that gets the address from a hardcoded interface and uses that for the binding, and then everything is hunky dory.<br>
<br>
Although I&#39;m interested in the root cause also, that may likely be outside of my control, so I wonder whether the hack can be turned into something more appropriate.<br>
<br>
So some questions:<br>
<br>
- I can&#39;t stop to think that somewhere in the codebase there is probably some portable code to extract addresses from an interface.<br>
- Is there already some MCA parameter that can be (re)used to specify the interface to use for this kind of purpose.<br>
- (And why is the &quot;client&quot; listening on a socket in the first place?)<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
<br>
Mark<br>
