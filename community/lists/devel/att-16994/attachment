<div dir="ltr">While looking the MPI_Testany issue, I came across a very unsettling sentence in the MPI standard (3.0 page 58 line 36).<div><br></div><div>&gt; The array is indexed from zero in C, and from one in Fortran.</div><div><br></div><div>This sentence seems to indicate that the index returned by the TestAny and TestSome (as well as the corresponding Wait functions) should be indexed starting from 1 in Fortran, but from 0 in C. Our C code returns all indexes starting from 0 (C), but I failed to find where we handle this case in Fortran? Or maybe I am interpreting too much the MPI standard?</div><div><br></div><div>Â  George.</div><div><br></div></div>
