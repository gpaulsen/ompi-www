The two files have a slightly different format and completely different meaning. The hostfile specifies how many slots are on a node. The rankfile specifies a rank and what node/slot it is to be mapped onto.<div><br></div>
<div>Rankfiles can use relative node indexing and refer to nodes received from a resource manager - i.e., without any hostfile.</div><div><br></div><div>So the files are intentionally quite different. Trying to combine them would be rather ugly.</div>

In order to use &quot;mpirun --rankfile&quot;, I also need to specify hosts/hostlist.  But that information is redundant with what I provide in the rankfile.  So, from a user&#39;s point of view, this strikes me as broken.  Yes?  Should I file a ticket, or am I missing something here about this functionality?<br>
