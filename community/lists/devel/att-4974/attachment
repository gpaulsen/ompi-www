&nbsp;The first three steps basically only involve code motion, moving items such as ompi_list, and renaming them, moving where the code is actually located in the repository, and the like. &nbsp;For these we do not plan to put out a formal RFC, but comments are very welcome, and any hands that are willing to help with this are even more welcome.<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;The last phase where the btl&#8217;s are made dependent on OPAL, and supporting libraries such as mpools I expect will be disruptive, and will definitely require an RFC, and will also be a longer process.<BR>
