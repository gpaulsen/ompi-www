&gt; my understanding is that there are two ways of seeing things :<br>
&gt; a) the &quot;R-way&quot; : the problem is the parent should not try to communicate to already exited processes<br>
&gt; b) the &quot;J-way&quot; : the problem is the children should have waited either in MPI_Comm_free() or MPI_Finalize()<br>
&gt; I don&#39;t think you can use option (b) - we can&#39;t have the children lingering around for the parent to call finalize, if I&#39;m understanding you correctly.<br>
</div>you understood me correctly.<br>
<br>
once again, i did not start investigating loop_spawn.<br>
<br>
in the case of intercomm_create, we would not run into this if the<br>
application had explicitly called MPI_Comm_free in the parent.<br>
so in this case *only*, and as explained by Jeff, b) could be an option<br>
to make OpenMPI happy.<br>
(to be blunt : if the user is not happy with children lingering around,<br>
he can explicitly call MPI_Comm_free before calling MPI_Comm_disconnect)<br>
<br>
i will start investigating loop_spawn from now<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
