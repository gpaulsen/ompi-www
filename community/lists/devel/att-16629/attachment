      i think that will not work.<br>
      <br>
      here is the full story :<br>
      <br>
      once upon a time, on solaris, we did not try to compile pthread&#39;ed
      app without any special parameters.<br>
      that was a minor annoyance on solaris 10 with old gcc : configure
      passed a flag (-pthread if i remember correctly)<br>
      that was not supported by gcc (at that time) and generated tons of
      warnings.<br>
      when i asked &quot;why don&#39;t we just try no special parameter on
      solaris ?&quot; i was replied this is because looong time ago<br>
      openmpi used solaris lwp, so solaris was &quot;special&quot; anyway.<br>
      since solaris is able to build (compile+link) a pthread&#39;ed app
      without any flags, i removed the special case for solaris,<br>
      and no flag was used.<br>
      then i noticed that lead to bad code (errno is global instead of
      per thread specific), so you automatically added -D_REENTRANT<br>
      on solaris (e.g. if the __sun__ macro is defined)<br>
      then i found that solarisstudio compilers do not define the
      __sun__macro automatically (__sun and sun are defined) so i
      improved<br>
      the test (e.g. we are on solaris if __sun__ or __sun is defined)<br>
      this was merged (yesterday) and is not in rc4<br>
      <br>
      what we should do know is unclear for me ...<br>
      is -D_REENTRANT enough for gcc compilers on solaris ?<br>
      is -D_REENTRANT *not* enough for solarisstudio compilers on
      solaris ?<br>
      /* if -D_REENTRANT is *not* enough, then we all we have to do is
      use -mt since that implies -D_REENTRANT */<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      a working solution (minus the minor annoyance i described earlier)
      is to restore<br>
      config/opal_check_os_flavors.m4<br>
      config/ompi_config_pthreads.m4<br>
      <br>
      and then i ll find a better way to correctly set the flags that
      must be used on solaris<br>
      <br>
      that being said, and based on Paul&#39;s availability, i d rather have
      a new tarball (rc5?) tested.<br>
      (do we *really* need -mt ? isn&#39;t -D_REENTRANT enough ?)<br>
      this tarball must include
<a href="https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi-release/commit/ac8b84ce674b958dbf8c9481b300beeef0548b83" target="_blank">https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi-release/commit/ac8b84ce674b958dbf8c9481b300beeef0548b83</a><br>
      <div>
        <pre>configury: test the __sun macro to detect solaris OS.</pre>
      </div>
      <br>
      FWIW. i was unable to reproduce the problem on solaris 11 with
      sunstudio 12.4 even if i do not use -D_REENTRANT *nor* -mt (!)<br>
      <br>
      Cheers,<br>

      <pre>Hi Paul

Can you try the attached patch? It would require running autogen, I fear.
Otherwise, I can add it to the tarball.

        <pre>Gilles,

The 1.8.3 test works where the 1.8.4rc4 one fails with identical configure
arguments.

While it may be overkill, I configured 1.8.4rc4 with

   CFLAGS=&quot;-m64 -mt&quot; --with-wrapper-cflags=&quot;-m64 -mt&quot; \
   LDFLAGS=&quot;-mt&quot; --with-wrapper-ldflags=&quot;-mt&quot;

The resulting run worked!

So, I very strongly suspect that the problem will be resolved if one
restores the configure logic that my previous email shows has vanished
(since that would restore &quot;-mt&quot; to CFLAGS and wrapper cflags).

HOWEVER, I can already see a key difference in the configure step.

In 1.8.3 &quot;-mt&quot; was added AUTOMATICALLY to CFLAGS by configure:

checking if C compiler and POSIX threads work as is... no - Solaris, not
checked
checking if C++ compiler and POSIX threads work as is... no - Solaris,
not checked
checking if Fortran compiler and POSIX threads work as is... no -
Solaris, not checked
checking if C compiler and POSIX threads work with -pthread... no
checking if C compiler and POSIX threads work with -pthreads... no
checking if C compiler and POSIX threads work with -mt... yes
checking if C++ compiler and POSIX threads work with -pthread... yes
checking if Fortran compiler and POSIX threads work with -pthread... yes

This is not the case in 1.8.4rc4:

checking if C compiler and POSIX threads work as is... yes
checking if C++ compiler and POSIX threads work as is... yes
checking if Fortran compiler and POSIX threads work as is... yes


So, it looks like a chunk of Solaris-specific configure logic was LOST.
