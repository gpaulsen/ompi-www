No parameter will help - the issue is that we couldn&#39;t find a TCP interface to use for wiring up the job. First thing you might check is that you have a TCP interface alive and active - can be the loopback interface, but you need at least something.<br>
<br>If you do have an interface, then you might rebuild OMPI with --enable-debug so you can get some diagnostics. Then run the job again with<br><br> -mca rml_base_verbose 10 -mca oob_base_verbose 10<br><br>and see what diagnostic error messages emerge.<br>

Hi,<br>
<br>
I am using open-mpi version 1.3.2. on SLES 11 machine. I have built it<br>
simply like ./configure =&gt; make =&gt; make install.<br>
<br>
I am facing the following error with mpirun on some machines.<br>
<br>
Root # mpirun -np 2 ls<br>
<br>
[NO-NAME] ORTE_ERROR_LOG: Not found in file runtime/orte_init_stage1.c at<br>
line 182<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
It looks like orte_init failed for some reason; your parallel process is<br>
likely to abort. There are many reasons that a parallel process can fail<br>
during orte_init; some of which are due to configuration or environment<br>
problems. This failure appears to be an internal failure; here&#39;s some<br>
additional information (which may only be relevant to an Open MPI<br>
developer):<br>
<br>
orte_rml_base_select failed<br>
--&gt; Returned value -13 instead of ORTE_SUCCESS<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
[host-desktop1:09127] [NO-NAME] ORTE_ERROR_LOG: Not found in file<br>
runtime/orte_system_init.c at line 42 [host-desktop1:09127] [NO-NAME]<br>
ORTE_ERROR_LOG: Not found in file runtime/orte_init.c at line 52<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Open RTE was unable to initialize properly. The error occured while<br>
attempting to orte_init(). Returned value -13 instead of ORTE_SUCCESS.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Can you please guide me to resolve this issue. Is there any run time<br>
environmental variable be set to get rid of this issue?<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks in Advance,<br>
Amit<br>
