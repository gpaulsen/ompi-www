I can talk about OpenRTE, if you want - pretty short, but could describe the research directions being discussed with others.<BR>

It's not that we were previously hiding them -- we just never got 
around to explicitly sharing them.

I think we should have similar presentations at the upcoming meeting.  
Can someone from each core organization (LANL, IU, UTK, HLRS) give a 
10-15 minute presentation (or whatever) listing all your goals and 
ambitions with OMPI?  Separate them into short- and long-term goals, if 
possible.

For example, I'll talk about IU's MPI-2 one-sided efforts, our plans 
for PBS and SLURM, and our future efforts for fault 
tolerance/checkpoint restart.

Thanks!</I></FONT></PRE>
