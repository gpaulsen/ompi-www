I have trying to install openMPI on cloud provided by Aamazon EC2, the<br>
problem is&quot;i have configured the 3 node cluster which was supported by<br>
UNIVA in amazon, then i have installed open MPI on all the nodes, but when i<br>
tried to run the MPI programs  Then i have got an libmpi.so is not installed and how to connect the other nodes in cluster to participate in computing the problem that is parallely executing the program.So can you please guide in configuring the Open MPI in cloud with the  nodes present in the cluster&quot;<br clear="all">
