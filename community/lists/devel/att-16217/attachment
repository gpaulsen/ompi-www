&gt; I think this is a pretty significant change in behavior for a minor release, Jeff. According to the interested parties:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &quot;I&#39;m reporting a performance (message rate 16%, latency 3%) regression when using PSM that occurred between OMPI v1.6.5 and v1.8.1.  I would guess it affects other networks too, but I haven&#39;t tested.  The problem stems from the --enable-smp-locks and --enable-opal-multi-threads options.&quot;<br>
<br>
Right, and we just fixed that problem.<br>
<br>
To be clear: the above report is from *before* we fixed the problem, not from *after* we fixed it.  After we fixed it, Intel confirmed that PSM performance went back up to v1.6 levels.<br>
<br>
It was never in the plan to bring over the enable-THREAD_MULTIPLE-beavhior-by-default functionality to the v1.8 branch.  It was a mistake that it got brought over.<br>
<br>
&gt; So, this has been in effect the entire 1.8 series and now you want to significantly alter the behavior.<br>
<br>
Put differently: I want to fix the performance bug.<br>
<br>
&gt; I&#39;m of the opinion that we should live with the mistake in the 1.8.x series and provide users with clear guidance on the default behavior and advice for disabling the threading support that is consistent across this series. 1.9.x is a clean slate.<br>
<br>
I disagree.<br>
<br>
MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE support barely works in v1.8.  Why have it on by default, especially when there&#39;s a performance penalty?<br>
