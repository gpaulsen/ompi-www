Hello Developers,<br><br>I am using Open MPI-1.5.3 for performing experiments with checkpoint and restart.<br>However when the number of nodes is more than 128, restart fails with an segmentation fault.<br><br>After debugging the code, I found that the cause of this error is that variables of type int_8 are used at various places<br>
for storing the &quot;id&quot;s of the application to be run on each node.<br><br>One example is in  orte_odls_base_default_construct_child_list()  in orte/mca/odls/base/odls_base_default_fns.c.<br>Here int8_t *app_idx is used as a pointer array of app_ids of the processes in the job. In my case the app_ids exceed 127 and they are read<br>
as a negative numbers.<br><br>I think there are many other places in the code where int8_t is used to hold the application id.<br><br>I tried some tricks like changing configure so that int8_t and uint8_t are no defined, hence int16_t is used instead.<br>
But I think the function unpack still expects int8_t, looking at the error which is raised -OPAL dss:unpack: got type 7 when expecting type 8<br><br>Can someone provide a solution to this.<br><br>Thank you.<br>Kishor<br><br>
