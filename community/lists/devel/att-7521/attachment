<P><FONT SIZE=2>I did test the patch 2 version and that does seem to be working for me. However, that obviously doesn't mean that it's safe.<BR>
<BR>
Should we put some atomics in there, to be absolutely sure?&nbsp; Or put a lock around the dlsym code to ensure that only 1 thread calls dlsym?<BR>

Comment(by cyeoh):<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;I might be misunderstanding whats going on here, but I don't think the<BR>
&nbsp;volatile will help with respect to the second two of the three causes of<BR>
&nbsp;the segv as AFAIK volatile doesn't make any guarantees when it comes<BR>
&nbsp;atomicity. It will force a reload each time but if the read is not atomic<BR>
&nbsp;anyway then there still could be problems<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;However I do suspect the latter two are not causing the problems. The<BR>
&nbsp;static pointer should be aligned and I think in that case the assignments<BR>
&nbsp;should be atomic (will be for powerpc, I think so for other<BR>
&nbsp;architectures).<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;I think its much more likely that dlsym was getting called when its not<BR>
&nbsp;safe to (the first theory).<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;The consolidation of the code looks good - sorry I should have done that<BR>
&nbsp;in the first place.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;If its working now is it possible that its because its now consolidated<BR>
&nbsp;into opal_mem_free_ptmalloc2_munmap that the munmap_real is getting called<BR>
&nbsp;consistently early at a time when its safe to call dlsym (ie not through<BR>
&nbsp;the munmap_real path which appears to be sometimes unsafe) ?<BR>
