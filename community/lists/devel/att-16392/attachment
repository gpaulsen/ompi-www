I?m not sure we have any developers using PTP - have you tried asking this question on the PTP mailing list, assuming that project still exists?<br>

&gt; Dear all,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I am trying to learn how Open MPI works. Followed many instructions on Web, I tried to setup MPI Hello projects on Eclipse PTP. I am wondering if there is any protocol to setup such an environment.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I did try a few combination, but still stuck at the point where sometimes there are:<br>
&gt; 1. little bugs symbol showing on the left panel (next to the line numbers) while debugging. Things like &quot;Symbol &#39;ompi_mpi_finalized&#39; could not be resolved&quot;. I think this is due to environmental variables or paths not being set correctly, but I don&#39;t know what I have missed.<br>
&gt; 2. Cannot toggle breakpoints or toggled breakpoints being set on a relative file path. This makes the threads not stopping at the breakpoints.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; My environment is CentOS 6.6 running on a machine with 32GB memory, and Intel i7-3770. Since I am still experimenting on local debugging, I am debugging on Generic Open MPI Interactive with connection type local or remotely to 127.0.0.1, and with only a few processes. Detailed Eclipse installation configuration attached.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; My Open MPI is configured as<br>
&gt; ../configure --enable-debug --enable-event-debug --enable-mem-debug --enable-mem-profile<br>
&gt; The compiler is GNU C compiler.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; This gives a lot of information in the console while debugging but not very useful. I am not sure if I should run &#39;make install&#39; for Open MPI to /usr, or simply set Open MPI source tree as part of the project, or both. Open MPI has examples folder but I don&#39;t know how to use the code directly as my source code. For now I can step into source code of Open MPI, but sometimes I cannot toggle breakpoints. Attached is my current debug configuration.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Good day,<br>
