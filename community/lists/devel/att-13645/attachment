</div><br><br>Nevermind that - I just recalled that test/util/opal_path_nfs.c is Linux-specific.  So, there won&#39;t be any testing coverage of the new code on any of my Solaris or BSD systems.  Nor will Mac OSX get any &quot;real&quot; testing.<br>
<br>Does anybody have suggestions (assuming I can mount an NFS dir on each of my systems) as to how one might verify that the revised opal_path_nfs() is *correct* on the BSDs and Solaris?  If there is no validation possible, then it might be safer for 1.7.4 to leave the no-op behavior.  However, as far as I can tell opal_path_nfs() is currently used ONLY for by shmem/mmap to *warn* about mapping files on network filesystems.  So, maybe this isn&#39;t critical at all.</div>
<div class="gmail_extra"><br></div><div class="gmail_extra">I *will* make a point of NOT setting OMPI_MCA_shmem_mmap_enable_nfs_warning=0 as I normally do in my testing (thought I can&#39;t remember why I added that to my testing scripts in the first place).  Then at least I might be able to tell if opal_path_nfs() is returning false positives.<br>
