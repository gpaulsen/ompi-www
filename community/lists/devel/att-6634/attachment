Hi Chris<br><br>There would be a &quot;-do-not-bind&quot; option that will prevent us from binding processes to anything which should cover that situation.<br><br>My point was only that we would be changing the out-of-the-box behavior to the opposite of today&#39;s, so all those such as yourself would now have to add the -do-not-bind MCA param to your default MCA param file.<br>
<br>Doable - but it -is- a significant change in our out-of-the-box behavior.<br><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Sun, Aug 16, 2009 at 2:14 AM, Chris Samuel <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:csamuel@vpac.org">csamuel@vpac.org</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br>

&gt; I just wanted to give everyone a heads up if they do not get bugs<br>
&gt; email.  I just submitted a CMR to move over some new paffinity options<br>
&gt; from the trunk to the v1.3 branch.<br>
<br>
Ralphs comments imply that for those sites that share nodes<br>
between jobs (such as ourselves, and most other sites that<br>
I&#39;m aware of in Australia) these changes will severely impact<br>
performance.<br>
<br>
I think that would be a Very Bad Thing(tm).<br>
<br>
Can it be something that defaults to being configured out<br>
for at least 1.3 please ?  That way those few sites that<br>
can take advantage can enable it whilst the rest of us<br>
aren&#39;t impacted.<br>
<br>
cheers,<br>
