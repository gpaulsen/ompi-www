My point was only that having both is clunky and leads to potential conflict. No good solution, so &lt;shrug&gt;<br>

&gt;&gt; Nobody was &quot;against&quot; retaining it. The issue is that &quot;-x&quot; isn&#39;t an MCA parameter, nor does it get translated to one under the covers. So the problem was one of how to insert it into the typical MCA param precedence chain.<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; I understand the combination of the two features is clunky and could lead to odd corner cases, but the &quot;-x&quot; argument is a feature I actually use on a fairly regular basis, but I am unlikely to use mca_base_env_list unless given no other choice. Â It&#39;s just a worse, clunkier interface unless one really needs to set that MCA parameter via environment variable.<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; So can we just strike the deprecation warning that is currently issued when &quot;-x&quot; is passed in the absence of &quot;mca_base_env_list&quot;?<br>
