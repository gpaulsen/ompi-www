<div dir="ltr">This is an attempt to summarize the status of the trunk and 1.7.4rc with respect to my testing.<div><br></div><div>There are 6 issues that to the best of my knowledge have not yet been conclusively closed.</div>
<div>There might still be others buried in my sea of test results.</div><div><br></div><div>1. opal/util/path.c</div><div>See thread beginning with <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/devel/2014/01/13597.php">http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/devel/2014/01/13597.php</a></div>
<div>Jeff and I have fixed this in trunk and Jeff  CMRed for 1.7.4.</div><div>CMR was committed to v1.7 (changeset 30256) and thus just made the v1.7 tarball tonight.</div><div>Closed for trunk.</div><div>Closure for v1.7 just depends on me to test.</div>
<div><br></div><div>2. oshem_info reports oshmem:bindings:fort:yes unconditionally</div><div>See thread beginning with <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/devel/2014/01/13616.php">http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/devel/2014/01/13616.php</a><br>
</div><div>and restarted in <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/devel/2014/01/13677.php">http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/devel/2014/01/13677.php</a></div><div>Mike Dubman indicated he will fix this for trunk.</div>
<div>This does NOT apply to v1.7 (no oshmem).</div><div><br></div><div>3. configure refuses btl:verbs on Solaris</div><div>See thread beginning with <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/devel/2014/01/13598.php">http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/devel/2014/01/13598.php</a><br>
</div><div>Jeff has indicated he will look into this one on trunk.</div><div>This does NOT apply to v1.7.</div><div><br></div><div>4. oob:tcp not using loopback interface for single-node runs</div><div>See thread beginning with <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/devel/2014/01/13655.php">http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/devel/2014/01/13655.php</a><br>
</div><div>Ralph and I determined that the reported issue was due to the firewall on my hosts blocking app-daemon connections.</div><div>Can work around via &quot;-mca oob_tcp_if_include lo&quot;</div><div>Ralph *may* see about a way to use loopback by default, but probably not prior to 1.7.5</div>
<div>This issue is present both in trunk and v1.7</div><div><br></div><div>5. pgi-8 and pgi-9 fail building mpi_f08</div><div>See thread beginning with <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/devel/2014/01/13651.php">http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/devel/2014/01/13651.php</a><br>
</div><div>Jeff is actively working to improve configure tests to disqualify these compilers.</div><div><div>This issue as initially reported is present in v1.7</div></div><div>In trunk the same issue is present for pgi-9, but is worse (configure &quot;Cannot continue&quot;) for pgi-8</div>
<div><br></div><div>6. netbsd-amd64 &quot;make install&quot; failure</div><div>See thread beginning with <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/devel/2013/12/13515.php">http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/devel/2013/12/13515.php</a><br>
</div><div>The issue does NOT appear on netbsd-i386 (reason unknown)</div><div>My attempts to autogen with the netbsd-supplied libtool turned up another (now resolved) issue, but didn&#39;t fix this one.</div><div>Nobody has even commented on this issue.</div>
<div><div>This issue is present both in trunk and v1.7</div></div><div><br></div><div>As far as I am concerned only #1 *must* be resolved for 1.7.4, and I am going to do my part ASAP.</div><div>Items #2 and #3 are trunk-only.</div>
<div>Resolving #4 would be nice, but has a simple work around and is an issue only on a &quot;broken&quot; host.</div><div>Resolving #5 would be great, but IMHO documenting these compilers as unsupported for mpi_f08 would be sufficient.</div>
<div>Resolving #6 seems unlikely given the level of interest so far.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>-Paul<br clear="all"><div><br></div>-- <br><font face="courier new, monospace"><div>Paul H.
