Attending the developers meeting sounds like a good idea, But I will be back from my vacation only on the 15th. So I will not be able to close in on my possibilities to attend the developers meeting before that. I will keep you posted on this.</div><div><br></div><div>@Ralph: The wedding went really well!

In general, this sounds like a great idea.<br>
<br>
We talked about this on the call today, and it looks like it&#39;s going to take a bit of thought into how to integrate this into OMPI.  I.e., we might have to adjust the mpool and/or allocator frameworks a bit first.<br>
<br>
Is there any chance that you can attend the OMPI face-to-face dev meeting in late January?<br>

</span><div><div class="h5">&gt; Hello all,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I have been working on an implementation for supporting the use of MPI_Alloc_mem with our new allocator library called memkind (<a href="https://github.com/memkind/" target="_blank">https://github.com/memkind/</a>). The memkind library allows to allocate from different kinds of memory where, kinds implemented within the library enable the control of NUMA and page size features.  This could be leveraged conveniently with MPI_Alloc_mem.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I was hoping to trigger the use of the memkind component by using either an info object or an mca parameter (mpirun -np x --mca mpool memkind ).<br>
&gt; The modules of the mpool framework are loaded from components in the btl framework and not in the base of mpool. But in the case of my implementation, the component can remain independent from the btl framework. Is there a way to introduce priority for mpool component selection?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Also, with the use of info objects in mpool_base_alloc.c, it looks like the same code path is taken irrespective of whether the info is null or not, as the branch conditions seem to be commented out. Could this be un-commented or will there be a different patch for this?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Please let me know,<br>
&gt; Thanks,<br>
&gt; Vish<br>
