I&#8217;m currently working in an environment where I cannot use SSH to launch child processes. &nbsp;Instead, the process with rank 0 skips the ssh_child function in plm_rsh_module.c and the child processes are all started at the same time on different machines. &nbsp;Coordination is done with static jobids and ports. &nbsp;I have sucessfully modified the code to get the hello_c example working. &nbsp;However, I&#8217;m having problems with inter-process communication when using MPI_Bcast. &nbsp;Is there something else that I&#8217;m obviously missing?<BR>

Thanks.<BR>
