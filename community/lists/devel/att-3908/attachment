All:<br><br>As of today (May 13, 2008), the trunk is under v1.3 feature freeze until it is stabilized and branched (targeted for May 23, 2008).&nbsp; Here are the guidelines for activity in the trunk while we are under the v1.3 feature freeze:<br>
<ol><li>New components can still be checked into the trunk, but do so with <tt>.<font size="4">ompi_ignore</font></tt> so that they can be filtered out at branch time.  Also, for newly checked in components, enter a trac ticket as a reminder to clean up the <font size="4"><tt>.ompi_ignore</tt></font>, if necessary, after the branch<br>
<br></li><li>The following items have <i>special</i> dispensation to come into the trunk late (cutoff date for them is May 20)</li><ul><li>Final parts of 1.3 Thread Multiple Support</li><li>Send &amp; Receive changes for improved latency (<a class="new ticket" href="https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/ticket/1250" title="Performance problem on SM (new)">#1250</a>)</li>
<li>XML component for <font size="4"><tt>orte_output()</tt></font> and friends</li></ul></ol><br>Thanks,<br>--Brad<br><br><br>Brad Benton<br>Open MPI v1.3 co-release manager<br><br>
