           : architectures    The Portable Hardware Locality
           : (hwloc) software package provides   a portable
           : abstraction (across OS, versions, architectures, ...)
           : of the hierarchical topology of modern architectures,
           : including   NUMA memory nodes,  shared caches,
           : processor sockets, processor cores  and processing
           : units (logical processors or &quot;threads&quot;). It also
           : gathers  various system attributes such as cache and
           : memory information. It primarily  aims at helping
           : applications with gathering information about modern
           : computing hardware so as to exploit it accordingly and
           : efficiently.    hwloc may display the topology in
           : multiple convenient formats.   It also offers a
           : powerful programming interface (C API) to gather
           : information   about the hardware, bind processes, and
           : much more.

             Hi all,    I have tested hwloc on ~40 different boxes
             on different archs (x86_64, i386, ppc, ia64). It works
             great.    Thanks  Jirka
