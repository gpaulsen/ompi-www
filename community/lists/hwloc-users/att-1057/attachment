      <div>Hi,</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>I'm trying to write a custom C++ allocator that wraps hwloc
        calls. &nbsp;I've tried using various hwloc_alloc* functions to set
        the memory bindings, but when I
        call&nbsp;hwloc_get_area_membind_nodeset to verify, I don't get the
        same policy I passed to alloc. &nbsp;Are there example codes that
        show how to set memory bindings? &nbsp;More generally, are there
        example codes that help illustrate how to use hwloc API?</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>Thanks,Rob Aulwes</div>

    Hello<br>
    <br>
    Your problem may be related to the fact that same policies are
    identical on some operating systems. For instance DEFAULT and
    FIRST_TOUCH are often identical. What did you set and what did you
    get back?<br>
    <br>
    There are many examples in the tests subdirectory, in
    doc/hwloc-helloc.c and in hwloc/helper.h and hwloc/inline.h, but I
    don't think we have much about the membind API, and this API isn't a
    easy one unfortunately (given the variety of existing policies and
    operating systems).<br>
