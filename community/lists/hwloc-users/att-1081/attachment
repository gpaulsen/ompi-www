<div>Hi,</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>A call to hwloc_topology_load is failing, but all that is returned is –1. &nbsp;Are there error reporting routines that can be called to get more details about the error? &nbsp;The doc for&nbsp;hwloc_topology_load only says that –1 is returned on error, but doesn't give
 any hints about what could cause an error (I already check that a topology object was initialized with hwloc_topology_init).</div>

<div>Thanks,</div>
