Hi,<br><br>I have just pushed RPM for hwloc 1.1 to Fedora repositories. I have updated EPEL5 as well. It should be available for download shortly.<br><br>It&#39; based on <br><br><a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/software/hwloc/nightly/v1.1/hwloc-1.1rc6r2967.tar.bz2">http://www.open-mpi.org/software/hwloc/nightly/v1.1/hwloc-1.1rc6r2967.tar.bz2</a><br>
<br>which is hwloc 1.1 plus following fixes:<br><br>- Fix hwloc_bitmap_to_ulong right after allocating the bitmap.<br>- Fix the minimum width of NUMA nodes, caches and the legend in the graphical lstopo output.<br>- Cleanup error management in hwloc-gather-topology.sh.<br>
- Add a manpage and usage for hwloc-gather-topology.sh on Linux.<br><br>I have also renamed hwloc-gather-topology.sh to hwloc-gather-topology  to be consistent with the naming in the upcoming version 1.2<br><br>Thanks<br>
Jirka<br><br><br><br><br>
