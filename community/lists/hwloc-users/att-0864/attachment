    I've compiled and run hwloc 1.6.1 on my development machine (Scientific Linux 6.2) currently with 1) GTX-480 and everything seems to be working perfectly. <BR>
    <BR>
    [kalloyd@devhost ~]$ lstopo -v<BR>
    &lt;snip&gt;<BR>
    Bridge Host-&gt;PCI L#0 (P#0 buses=0000:[00-08])<BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bridge PCI-&gt;PCI (P#48 busid=0000:00:03.0 id=8086:340a class=0604(PCI_B) buses=0000:[02-02] PCIVendor=&quot;Intel Corporation&quot; PCIDevice=&quot;5520/5500/X58 I/O Hub PCI Express Root Port 3&quot;) &quot;Intel Corporation 5520/5500/X58 I/O Hub PCI Express Root Port 3&quot;<BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PCI 10de:06c0 (P#8192 busid=0000:02:00.0 class=0300(VGA) PCIVendor=&quot;nVidia Corporation&quot; PCIDevice=&quot;GF100 [GeForce GTX 480]&quot;) &quot;nVidia Corporation GF100 [GeForce GTX 480]&quot;<BR>
    &lt;snip&gt;<BR>
    <BR>
    lstopo --whole-io shows much more detail, including both sides of the GTX-480.<BR>
    <BR>
    I haven't yet written an OpenMPI, OpenGL program to see how it works across a small cluster, but that will give me something to do in my spare time ...<BR>

Stefan (or anybody else interested in hwloc GPU support),
Did you have any chance to look at this?

Le 01/02/2013 14:57, Brice Goglin a &#233;crit :
&gt; I just committed big changes to the display branch (and I also merged
&gt; latest trunk changes).
&gt;
&gt; lstopo will now report things like this:
&gt;         PCI 10de:06d1
&gt;           GPU L#0 &quot;:0.0&quot;
&gt;           GPU L#1 &quot;cuda0&quot;
&gt;           GPU L#2 &quot;nvml0&quot;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The changes include:
&gt;
&gt; 1) We don't have a &quot;display&quot; specific OS device anymore, it's just
&gt; another kind of GPU among cuda, opencl and nvml. The name is the X
&gt; server display name. There are string attributes in these new GL GPU OS
&gt; devices (lstopo -v):
&gt;   GPU L#9 (Backend=GL GPUVendor=&quot;NVIDIA Corporation&quot; GPUModel=&quot;Tesla
&gt; C2050&quot;) &quot;:0.2&quot;
&gt;
&gt; 2) The gl component is now buildable as a plugin
&gt;
&gt; 3) Given (2), we can't expose internal GL routines in the public API. So
&gt; hwloc/gl.h is just made of inline helpers as any other hwloc/foo.h. It
&gt; now contains functions to convert between displays (name or port/device)
&gt; and hwloc OS devices:
&gt;
&gt; hwloc_obj_t hwloc_gl_get_display_osdev_by_port_device(hwloc_topology_t
&gt; topology, unsigned port, unsigned device)
&gt; hwloc_obj_t hwloc_gl_get_display_osdev_by_name(hwloc_topology_t
&gt; topology, const char *name)
&gt; int hwloc_gl_get_display_by_osdev(hwloc_topology_t topology, hwloc_obj_t
&gt; osdev,unsigned *port, unsigned *device)
&gt;
&gt; If you really need the PCI device, just use osdev-&gt;parent as documented.
&gt; If you need the locality, use hwloc_get_non_io_ancestor(topology,
&gt; osdev)-&gt;cpuset
&gt; See tests/gl.c for examples.
&gt;
&gt; Please review hwloc/gl.h and let me know if that works for you. I hope I
&gt; used the words port/device/server/screen as expected.
&gt;
&gt; The last thing on my TODO list is to decide is whether we keep the &quot;GL&quot;
&gt; name or switch to something among display/X11/X/... for filenames and
&gt; function names.
&gt;
&gt; Brice
