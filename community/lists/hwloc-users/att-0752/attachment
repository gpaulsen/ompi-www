      I would love to get this by my next release, say in the next 3-6
      months. Is that something that would be possible? Is there
      anything I can do to help?<br>

    We'll have a v1.6 release before the end of the year, and hopefully
    a first release candidate by mid-november for SC12.<br>
    It'll include the Darwin code (just committed) and the x86 code
    (Samuel committed it). But I need to finish reworking the core
    components before the x86 code becomes available to non-FreeBSD
    backends. Hopefully, I'll have something ready by next week.<br>

    Thanks for all your help anyway<br>
