I just compiled tags\hwloc-1.0.0 with cygwin (I'd prefer mingw). Now <br>how do I enable debugging? Also the output of lstopo is very strange<br>(maybe debugging info is already enabled)<br><br>--------------------------<br>Alexandros Papadogiannakis<br><br><br><br><br>&gt; Date: Tue, 25 May 2010 02:07:20 +0200<br>&gt; From: samuel.thibault@inria.fr<br>&gt; To: hwloc-users@open-mpi.org<br>&gt; Subject: Re: [hwloc-users] Wrong cache with hwloc 1.0 on windows<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Hello,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Αλέξανδρος Παπαδογιαννάκης, le Tue 25 May 2010 02:58:57 +0300, a écrit :<br>&gt; &gt; As you can see hwloc 1.0 doesn't show my L3 and L2 cache while it<br>&gt; &gt; worked fine with hwloc 0.9.3.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Are you able to rebuild a version yourself with debugging enabled to<br>&gt; check the output?  On windows 7, the difference is that the extended<br>&gt; GetLogicalProcessorInformationEx interface is used instead of <br>&gt; GetLogicalProcessorInformation, maybe hwloc has some bugs in the former,<br>&gt; but that may just be Windows itself not reporting things properly.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; &gt; Also both versions fail to show my RAM correctly, they both report the<br>&gt; &gt; currently available instead of the 4GB that I have.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Windows does not provide any sane way to report the latter.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Samuel<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; hwloc-users mailing list<br>&gt; hwloc-users@open-mpi.org<br>&gt; http://www.open-mpi.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/hwloc-users<br> 		 	   		  <br /><hr />Hotmail: Trusted email with powerful SPAM protection. <a href='https://signup.live.com/signup.aspx?id=60969' target='_new'>Sign up now.</a></body>
