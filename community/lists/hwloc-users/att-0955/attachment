      <pre wrap="">Hi

I&#8217;m trying to build hwloc (1.8) on Linux (CentOS 6 x64) as a static library that will be linked into my own shared library that is part of my application. I am not using very much of hwloc, and I am trying to avoid having the full hwloc shared library distributed with my application just for the tiny bit of it that I am using. However, this turns out to be a challenge.

I configured with:

./configure --enable-static --disable-shared

which builds the static library just fine, but when I link it to my shared library I get this error:

/usr/bin/ld: /usr/local/lib/libhwloc.a(topology.o): relocation R_X86_64_32S against `.rodata' can not be used when making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC

So, I tried re-configuring:

./configure --enable-static --disable-shared CXXFLAGS=-fPIC

but after rebuilding the library, I still get the same link error.

Is this a possible configuration? I can make my app work with hwloc in its own shared library distributed with my app, it just seems so wasteful for what I&#8217;m doing with it. I&#8217;m not the biggest Linux expert, so I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;m doing something wrong, but I have managed to get other libraries I&#8217;m using (boost.regex and zeromq) to work this way, so it seems like it should be possible.

Thank you for any help you can provide.
