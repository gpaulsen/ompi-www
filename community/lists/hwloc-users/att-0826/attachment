      <div dir="ltr">Given that the Cray compiler aborts on this code

          is incompatible with "int ffsl(long)") indicates that there is
          some other problem. Note that hwloc never declares ffsl; it
          only calls __builtin_ffsl.</span>

    Ok thanks for the debugging, Erik and Jeff.<br>
    I am going to release 1.6.1 without any such change. If we ever get
    similar reports in the future, we'll reconsider and may add a
    configure-workaround.<br>
