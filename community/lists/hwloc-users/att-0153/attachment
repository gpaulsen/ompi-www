Hi. Yesterday one of the PCs at my university was updated to Debian "squeeze" with <br>kernel 2.6.32-5-amd64. I don't know if it's the kernel, hwloc or something else's fault<br>but I have a program tha worked fine before the update, but not anymore. It does work<br>without problem in other PCs. <br><br>The program uses hwloc_set_thread_cpubind() to bind some threads to specific cpus<br>but now it doesn't work. hwloc_set_thread_cpubind() returns zero but doesn't bind<br>the thread. The problem is that when I call hwloc_set_thread_cpubind() the threads <br>are waiting on a posix barrier. <br><br>--------------------------<br>Alexandros Papadogiannakis<br><br><br> 		 	   		  <br /><hr />Hotmail: Trusted email with powerful SPAM protection. <a href='https://signup.live.com/signup.aspx?id=60969' target='_new'>Sign up now.</a></body>
