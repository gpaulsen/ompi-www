<span class="">&gt; I was trying to use HWLOC on Ivybridge. I found that there is some<br>
&gt; inconsistency in the core numbering.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; In the attached image (generated from running lstopo (hwloc - 1.9.1), we can<br>
&gt; see that cores 6,7 do not exist although, PU#6 and PU#7 does exist.<br>
<br>
</span>I am not very surprised. Those are physical numbers, which BIOS &amp; such determine<br>
in various ways, which may not be contiguous.  If you are looking for a<br>
contiguous numbering, you need to have a look at the logical numbers, obtained<br>
from lstopo -l.<br>
