      <div>Hi, thanks for responding.&nbsp;</div>

      <div>The CPUModel is definitely available on this machine. A 32
        bit process on the same machine correctly finds the model name
        using code that calls the cpuid inline assembly to get it, and
        the machine itself is a VM running on a Mac, and I get the same
        model name from the code on Mac and on a Linux VM running on the
        same machine as well. It seems to be an issue with the Windows
        port of hwloc, and possibly only with the 64 bit version (I
        haven&#8217;t tried the 32 bit version yet).&nbsp;</div>
      <div><br>

      <div>I am using the prebuilt binary on Windows. I haven&#8217;t tried
        (and I&#8217;m not sure I want to try) building hwloc from source on
        Windows x64 using MSVC, but I have found out so far today that
        Microsoft makes available a compiler intrinsic to get access to
        cpuid as a C function, and that&#8217;s supposed to allow you to do
        the same kind of cpuid call work done previously as inline
        assembly. Perhaps someone out there is more familiar with this
        specific functionality in hwloc and can fix this for the 64 bit
        Windows build? I can take a stab at it, but like I said, the
        biggest hwloc development I&#8217;ve done is setting a flag in the
        configure script when I build on Unix.</div>

    Building for MSVC might be hard right now but somebody is working at
    it (and I have a vcxproj to check in my INBOX).<br>
    I will debug a bit more to see if it's actually a 64bit cpuid
    problem on windows.<br>

      <div>As a last question, where is the &#8220;CPUModel&#8221; documented about
        where it would appear? I was looking for that but couldn&#8217;t find
        it.</div>

    There's a "object attributes" section in the doc. In the PDF, just
    look for CPUModel. In the HTML, these sections are available from
    the "related pages" tab.<br>
