	I happened to run &quot;lstopo --of xml&quot; as root on a RHEL6.1 system
and was surprised with a core dump:

Sure enough, when I fed the same command to valgrind, it told me

	This seems much more like a libpci problem than an hwloc one
but I don't recall seeing it mentioned before, nor did I see anything
obvious looking for &quot;pci core&quot; in the report tracking system.  Did I
miss it?
