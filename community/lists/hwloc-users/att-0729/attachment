Hi folks, I just discovered hwloc and it&#39;s really cool.  Very useful, so thanks!<div><br></div><div>I&#39;m trying to understand the hardware layout of a computer I&#39;m working with, an HP Proliant DL360p G8 server with two Intel E5-2690 processors.</div>
<div><br></div><div>I&#39;m getting puzzling results from lstopo (from hwloc 1.5).  The results I get in Linux make good sense, but the results I get in FreeBSD (running on the same hardware) seem wrong.  Specifically, notice how the first 10 CPUs are not assigned to any socket or L1/L2 cache.  Strange!</div>
<div><br></div><div>I&#39;ve attached the output from both platforms.</div><div><br></div><div>Any ideas what I&#39;m doing wrong?</div>
