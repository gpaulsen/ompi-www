Greetings,<br><br>This might be a naive question, but I&#39;d like to clarify nonetheless: to provide any sort of affinity guarantees, hwloc mem binding APIs assume that any memory allocation is done exclusively via hwloc_alloc_membind() and friends?  And if I use &quot;raw&quot; calls to malloc() or posix_memalign() etc then any ensuing affinity will be incidental at best?<br>
<br>Thank you in advance,<br>Vlad<br>
