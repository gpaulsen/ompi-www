    The new "bgq" branch now contains proper topology for BG/Q nodes
    (including cores and caches, except the prefetching cache) as well
    as support for set/get binding of the current thread or of another
    thread. No process-wide binding since I don't know how to iterate
    over all threads of a process.<br>

    (this is our new regression testing tool, I hope the tarball won't
    disappear too soon)<br>
    <br>
    I don't expect a lot more features so this branch will likely go
    into trunk very soon. But if you can look at it, that'll be great.<br>

      <div dir="ltr">I am trying to use hwloc on a Blue Gene/Q. Building
        and installing worked fine, and it reports the system
        configuration fine as well (i.e. it shows all PUs). However,
        when I try to inquire the thread/core bindings, hwloc crashes
        with an error in libc's free(). This is both with 1.6 and
        1.6.1rc1.
        <div>
          <br>
        </div>
        <div>The error occurs apparently in CPU_FREE called from
          hwloc_linux_find_kernel_nr_cpus.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="">Does this ring a bell with anyone? I know this is
          not enough information to debug things, but do you have any
          pointers for things to look at?</div>
        <div style=""><br>
        </div>
        <div style="">I remember reading somewhere that the last bit in
          a cpu_set_t cannot be used. A Blue Gene/Q has 64 PUs, and may
          be using 64-bit integers to hold cpu_set_t data. Could this be
          an issue?</div>
        <div style=""><br>
        </div>
        <div style="">My goal is to examine and experiment with
          thread/core bindings with OpenMP to improve performance.</div>
