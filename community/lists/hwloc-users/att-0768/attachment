        I would love to get this by my next release, say in the next 3-6
        months. Is that something that would be possible? Is there
        anything I can do to help?<br>

      We'll have a v1.6 release before the end of the year, and
      hopefully a first release candidate by mid-november for SC12.<br>
      It'll include the Darwin code (just committed) and the x86 code
      (Samuel committed it). But I need to finish reworking the core
      components before the x86 code becomes available to non-FreeBSD
      backends. Hopefully, I'll have something ready by next week.<br>

    By the way, in case you missed it, with hwloc 1.6rc1 (released last
    week), you should get CPUModel attributes on all x86 machines, as
    well as Mac OS X on all architectures. Obviously this includes
    Windows/x86 (I only tested on 32bits).<br>
    <br>
    I will likely release 1.6rc2 tomorrow or tuesday, and the final 1.6
    will arrive by the end of the month if nobody complains.<br>
