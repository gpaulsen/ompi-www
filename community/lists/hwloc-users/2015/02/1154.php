Hi,
<br>
<p>in our workstation we have a problem with openmpi. The workstation was
<br>
running under Ubuntu 12.04 were we had already performance issues but
<br>
didn't got any error messages, after upgrading to Ubuntu 14.04 we get
<br>
the error message below. Using lstopo reveals that the problem was
<br>
persistent in the old system, too.
<br>
Maybe you know what to do.
<br>
<p>Best regards,
<br>
&nbsp;Michael Sch&#195;&#182;nitzer
