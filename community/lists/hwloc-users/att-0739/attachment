          There were two bugs which resulted into cpuid not being

      <div>I updated my checkout to r4882, reconfigured, rebuilt, and
        reran it, and it made the same output as 1.5. &nbsp;So that's an
        improvement over the svn trunk yesterday, but it's not all the
        way fixed yet!</div>

    For what it's worth, I tested the x86 code on Linux on a dual
    E5-2650 machine and got the correct topology (exactly like your
    Linux on your server). So the x86 detection code may be ok, but
    something else wouldn't.<br>
    There's still at least one bug in the freebsd code according to our
    internal regression tool, stay tuned.<br>
