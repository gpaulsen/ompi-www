      The CPUModel attribute should be only in Socket or machine/root
      objects. At least, that's what I documented and what I seem to see
      in the code. Did you actually see any other place?<br>
      <br>
      So it may just mean that the CPUModel is not available on your
      machine? Or maybe the code below is buggy somehow? Does lstopo -v
      on Windows show a CPUModel attribute? It does in a 32bits binary
      running on my Win7 64bits, but doesn't seem to find anything when
      running the 64bits binary. I don't remember well if there was a
      specific Windows 64bits issue in the cpuid code in the x86
      backend.<br>

      <pre wrap="">Hi again.

I’m trying to use hwloc 1.8 on Windows, Linux and Mac to get the CPU model string (e.g., “Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3520M CPU @ 2.90GHz”). Since hwloc on different platforms seem to stash this in different objects, I’m using code like this:

String name;
hwloc_obj_type_t objs[] = { 
    HWLOC_OBJ_MACHINE, 
    HWLOC_OBJ_SOCKET, 
    HWLOC_OBJ_CORE, 
    HWLOC_OBJ_PU, };
for( size_t index = 0; index &lt; (sizeof( objs ) / sizeof( hwloc_obj_type_t )) &amp;&amp; name.Empty(); ++index )
{
    hwloc_obj_t obj = hwloc_get_obj_by_type( topology, objs[ index ], 0 );
    if( !obj ) continue;
    const char *str = hwloc_obj_get_info_by_name( obj, "CPUModel" );
    if( str ) name = String( str ).Trim();
}

On Mac, it works (found string at HWLOC_OBJ_MACHINE), and on Linux it works (found string at HWLOC_OBJ_SOCKET), but on Windows x64, none of these find the string. They all return a NULL pointer.

Am I missing something? I tried a few other of the object types, but didn’t find it with them either (I actually tried looping through all integer values between 0 and HWLOC_OBJ_TYPE_MAX and it didn’t appear in any of them).

Thank you for any help you can provide.
