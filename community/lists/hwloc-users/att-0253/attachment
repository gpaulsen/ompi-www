Hi all,<br><br>I am trying to identify NIC in a topology with the help of HWLOC.<br>Is NIC considered as a object in the topology.I am able to find other objects in the mailing list such as CORE,PU,CACHE etc.<br><br>I am trying to find this because I am interested in finding distance between a Socket and a NIC in a given topology.<br>

<br>-- <br>With kind regards,<br>Saktheesh.<br>
