Hi everyone,<br><br>I&#39;m beginner in using hwloc and I have some questions.<br><br>First: I&#39;m looking for a way to find <span>which core
</span><span>is using by the current thread. (</span><span>maybe </span><span>with hwloc_get_thread_cpubind ??)<br><br>Second: is there a way to set the number of core usable for the current process ?<br>
<br>Thank you in advance for your help.<br>Guillaume Arnal<br></span>
