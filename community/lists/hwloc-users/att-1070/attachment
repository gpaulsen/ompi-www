<body class='hmmessage'><div dir='ltr'>Hello hwloc experts<br><br>I encounter this bug when I'm using mpirun or hwloc directly :<br><br>****************************************************************************<br>* hwloc has encountered what looks like an error from the operating system.<br>*<br>* L3 (cpuset 0x000003f0) intersects with NUMANode (P#0 cpuset 0x0000003f) without inclusion!<br>* Error occurred in topology.c line 940<br>*<br>* Please report this error message to the hwloc user's mailing list,<br>* along with the output from the hwloc-gather-topology script.<br>****************************************************************************<br><br>The output of hwloc-gather-topology is attached. The OS is Centos 7.<br><br>The tool launched with mpirun runs as expected, still the message is a bit worrying...<br><br>I was able to avoid this message by enabling "node interleaving" in the bios (basically disables NUMA). In my case, I got a 5% performance loss with that setting. It could be acceptable, but I would like to understant what is going on.<br><br>So is my motherboard / BIOS / OS buggy ?<br><br>Best regards<br> 		 	   		  </div></body>
