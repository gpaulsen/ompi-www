<div dir="ltr">Hi folks<div><br></div><div>As we look at the Python client, there is an issue with the supported Python version. There was a significant break in the user-level API between Python 2.x and Python 3. Some of the issues are described here:</div><div><br></div><div><a href="https://docs.python.org/2/glossary.html#term-2to3">https://docs.python.org/2/glossary.html#term-2to3</a><br></div><div><br></div><div>Noah and I have chatted about this, and we feel it may be best to just lock-in on Python 2.x until an overwhelming reason arises for us to transition to Python 3. At that time, we would have to do a backward-break to update.</div><div><br></div><div>The virtualenv content file (pyenv.txt) already reflects this requirement, so folks who use virtual environments are set.</div><div><br></div><div>Make sense?</div><div>Ralph</div><div><br></div></div>
