<p>Ya, this is a hard one to do (Ethan suggested one method as well).   
<br>
The problem is to try to figure out *who* created the problem.  But  
<br>
it's not always obvious, nor is it easy to figure out.  Cisco nightly  
<br>
regressions of internal software say, &quot;A problem occurred -- here's  
<br>
the people who committed since the test last ran successfully.&quot;  So  
<br>
it becomes a human problem to figure it out.
<br>
<p>(that, and our SQA director puts a life-sized Dr. Evil cardboard  
<br>
cutout in your cube if you break the build ;-) )
<br>
<p><span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I would like to schedule some phone time with you guys and Ethan and

<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; me to talk about what's working, what's not working, etc.  One

<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; obvious question I have is: is the INI config file format suitable?
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Do we need to do something more complex that would allow

<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; consolidation of your various configurations?  ...etc.

</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; Tim M and I spent the better part of two days revamping our current

<span class="quotelev1">&gt; setup to do some more 'advanced' things (Parallel builds, etc...). We
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; are putting all of these scripts in ompi-tests/iu/mtt in case anyone
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; wants to see how we are doing it and use that as an example for doing

<span class="quotelev1">&gt; something similar.

<br>
<p>Ethan -- can you coordinate with everyone to find a time that works?   
<br>
I can setup a phone bridge if necessary.  Monday all day and Tuesday  
<br>
afternoon work for me.
