Guys --
<br>
<p>Just to let you know, the status of the code base hasn't changed in
<br>
quite a while.  I'm still halfway through updating the phases to the new
<br>
scheme that we agreed upon at the IU meeting.  However, I do plan to
<br>
return to finishing this -- potentially before I go to LANL (although
<br>
that's looking somewhat doubtful).  Since we're branching for v1.1 in
<br>
the Very Near Future, this should give me the opportunity to finish work
<br>
in the main code base and then spend some time on MTT and get it
<br>
functional [enough].
<br>
<p>Also welcome to Rolf Vandevaart -- the guy who is always tapped to do QA
<br>
things at Sun for their MPI.  As you know, Sun is joining the group;
<br>
they were persistent in asking to look at MTT, and despite all my strong
<br>
disclaimers (including: the code in SVN doesn't currently work, there's
<br>
no documentation, etc.), he wanted to see the code.  :-)  I spent a
<br>
while with him on the phone on Friday going over the general scheme of
<br>
things.
<br>
<p>So I added Rolf's account to the MTT checkout, and he's on this list --
<br>
he'll probably be asking us questions.
