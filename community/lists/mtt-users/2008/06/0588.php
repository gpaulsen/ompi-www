Hi Open MPI users and developers,
<br>
The mailmain service hosted by the Open Systems Lab will be
<br>
upgraded this afternoon at 2pm Eastern, and thus will be
<br>
unavailable for about an hour.  See our sysadmin's notice:
<br>
<p>========
<br>
The new version(2.1.10) of mailman was released on Apr 21 2008.
<br>
It has a lot of good features included and many bugs are fixed.
<br>
<p>The OSL would like to upgrade the current mailman(2.1.9) to get
<br>
the benefit of the new version.
<br>
The upgrade would be at 2:00PM(E.T.) on June 12, 2008.
<br>
<p>The mailman, sendmail, and some mailman admin/info websites
<br>
services would NOT be available during the following time period.
<br>
- 11:00am-12:00pm Pacific US time
<br>
- 12:00pm-1:00pm Mountain US time
<br>
- 1:00pm-2:00pm Central US time
<br>
- 2:00pm-3:00pm Eastern US time
<br>
- 7:00pm-8:00pm GMT
<br>
<p>Please let me know if you have any concerns or questions about this upgrade.
<br>
<p>========
<br>
<p>Note: I do not know if svn checkin e-mails will be queued during that time or
<br>
if they will be lost.  So, if you have something important you are checking in
<br>
to svn, you might avoid doing so during that hour today.
<br>
