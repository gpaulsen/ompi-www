<div dir="ltr">Related to this conversation, I am proposing that we as a community try to cultivate some public tests. See the following link for the start of the dicussion.<div>  <a href="https://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/devel/2016/05/18997.php">https://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/devel/2016/05/18997.php</a></div><div><br></div><div>We won&#39;t be able to open up the ompi-tests repo to the public. But we might be able to start building a publicly accessible repo of tests that we can keep public. If you have any comments on that proposal feel free to chime in.</div></div><div class="gmail_extra"><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Tue, May 17, 2016 at 11:59 AM, Ben Parsons <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:bsparson@gmail.com" target="_blank">bsparson@gmail.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex">I was looking into using MTT for testing multiple vendor installed<br>
versions of MPI, and was wondering if there were a set of ini files<br>
for some public benchmarks? (such as the OSU benchmarks). I saw some<br>
of the ini files had a couple tests out of the OSU benchmarks, but I<br>
was hoping to find a more comprehensive set.<br>
<br>
If anybody knows of any I would appreciate it, I couldn&#39;t find any<br>
online, and figured I should check before writing my own.<br>

Thanks,<br>
