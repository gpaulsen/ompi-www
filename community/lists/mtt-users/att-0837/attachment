<div dir="ltr">I think this is fine. If we do start to organize ourselves for a formal release then we might want to move to pull requests to keep the branch stable for a bit, but for now this is ok with me.<div><br></div><div>The Python client looks like it will be a nice addition. Hopefully, I will have the REST submission interface finished in the next couple months and that will make it easier to submit to the DB. I probably won&#39;t get cycles to finish that work until after Jan 12. I plan to have it done before the end of Jan - let me know if you need it before then.</div><div><br></div></div><div class="gmail_extra"><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Thu, Dec 10, 2015 at 1:10 PM, Ralph Castain <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:rhc@open-mpi.org" target="_blank">rhc@open-mpi.org</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex"><div dir="ltr">Hey folks<div><br></div><div>I&#39;m working on the Python client and it is coming along pretty well.
