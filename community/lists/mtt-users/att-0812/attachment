<html><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html charset=windows-1252"></head><body style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">Hi Ralph and Jeff,<div><br></div><div>Thanks for our replies and your willingness to help.</div><div><br></div><div>Our intentions are as follows:</div><div><br></div><div>There are lots or customers/users that use different variants of MPI and specifically OpenMPI in our clusters. They run various interesting things with MPI/OpenMPI. Sometimes they end up with some issues as they run their programs. We spend lot of time to figure out what their problems are. Sometimes it could be because of the way we have set up our MPI modules.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>So we need a reliable set of MPI tests/programs to run nightly or at some frequency to see that all our MPI settings are okay. I thought MTT will be a good tool to do that. I assume that you have the right set of testing programs and a way to present the results.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>My manager thinks that he don’t mind sending the results of this particular set of tests to an external server (as yours), as long as we got access to those test results and we can watch it on some visualisation tool, list, etc.</div><div><br></div><div>We don't intend to test nightly Open MPI tarballs. We are using easy-build to install our libraries/apps. I think it may conflict with easy-build workflow. Or is there any way to integrate it with easy-build?</div><div><br></div><div>We would like to get access to a comprehensive list of tests, that can verify the MPI/OpenMPI health of our systems.</div><div><br></div><div>Hope this clarification helps. Now what do you suggest?</div><div><br><div apple-content-edited="true">

Personally, I would really welcome getting the MTT results from another site as it would expand coverage of various environments, something we are beginning to lack. So even if Jaison et al aren't going to contribute code, contributing test result data is a valuable contribution in itself.<br><br>I think this fits to your question about testing nightly OMPI tarballs. If Jaison can run tests with our tarballs and tell us the results, and that meets his needs to characterize/validate their cluster, then it seems like both sides win.<br><br><br>On Jun 10, 2014, at 7:46 AM, Jeff Squyres (jsquyres) &lt;<a href="mailto:jsquyres@cisco.com">jsquyres@cisco.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br><br><blockquote type="cite">Sorry for the delay in replying -- I was at the MPI Fourm last week, and my available time for email was limited.<br><br>So I think there's three issues on the table:<br><br>1.

Submitting data to <a href="http://mtt.open-mpi.org">mtt.open-mpi.org</a><br><br>Forgive me -- as you'll see below, you're raising a corner case that we have not previously encountered...<br><br>Can I ask what your intentions are? &nbsp;We typically haven't given access to #1 or #3 except to developer organizations in the Open MPI community itself (signing the IP agreement is the first step). &nbsp;This is not to say that we won't -- it's just that you happen to be the first organization who has expressed a more-than-passing interest in #1 and #3 :-), but you do not appear to be interested in becoming a contributor or member Open MPI organization. &nbsp;We haven't really thought about this case before.<br><br>I'd like to reiterate two points:<br><br>1. You don't need to sign the Open MPI IP agreement to use MTT; MTT is open source software that anyone can freely use under the BSD license.<br>2. Most of the tests in the ompi-tests repo are publicly available; we just don't have redistribution rights (which is why our repo is closed). &nbsp;We have augmented these publicly-available test suites with a bunch of home-grown tests, too, but I don't know if they're generally useful outside of Open MPI (i.e., some test for specific Open MPI behavior).<br><br>Also, I don't think I was specific about this before, but submitting data to <a href="http://mtt.open-mpi.org">mtt.open-mpi.org</a> is intended for tracking the nightly development tarballs. &nbsp;It's not meant as a general MTT database hosting platform for individual organizations' internal testing.<br><br>So I guess my questions are:<br><br>1. Do you really want/need access to our SVN repo, or do you just want/need a list of the test suites that you can download from the internet yourself?<br><br>2.

Several examples are included in the repo. I can also share mine with you as it does pretty much what you describe. I have a simple "runmtt.sh" script that executes the tests for me, but it is totally trivial and easily shared.
