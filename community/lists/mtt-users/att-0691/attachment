<div>Dear,</div>
<div>   I developed one application using openmpi in c++. This application should start internally (by system call) another application which is also developed in c++ and openmpi. When this external application is called with C system function the following messages are showed:</div>

<div> </div>
<div>[localhost.localdomain:05275] 00B: Connectio to HNP lost</div>
<div>[localhost.localdomain:05276] 00B: Connectio to HNP lost</div>
<div>[localhost.localdomain:05277] 00B: Connectio to HNP lost<br clear="all"></div>
<div></div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Please, could someone explain what is happening in this case?</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Best,</div>
<div>   Carlos Santos</div>
