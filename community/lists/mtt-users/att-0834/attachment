<div dir="ltr">Hey folks<div><br></div><div>I&#39;m working on the Python client and it is coming along pretty well. The code is completely separate from the Perl-based client and doesn&#39;t interact with it, so I would like to push it into the repo on an on-going basis so others can look at it and comment as I go rather than hold it until it is &quot;complete&quot;.</div><div><br></div><div>Any objections? Obviously, it won&#39;t be fully functional at times - mostly available for architectural review and directional suggestions.</div><div><br></div><div>Ralph</div><div><br></div></div>
