There really isn't anything the sys admin has to do, though - what is required is that users periodically order their programs to checkpoint so they can be restarted after a failure.<div><br></div><div>Checkpointing is typically done either by the app itself (say, when it reaches some point it feels is a good one to save), or using a script that just orders a checkpoint every so many seconds.</div><div><br></div><div>What we have said is that we don't believe the FT "run thru failure" position pushed by UTK is particularly required at this time. Partly a question of impact vs benefit, mostly due to competing approaches offering equivalent fault recovery capability with less impact. But that's a separate discussion.</div><div><br></div><div><br><div><div>On Jun 19, 2012, at 11:16 AM, George Bosilca wrote:</div><br class="Apple-interchange-newline"><blockquote type="cite"><div style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space; ">It has been clearly stated that the official position pushed forward by a majority of the Open MPI developer community is that fault tolerance is not needed so we (read this as the official version of Open MPI) do not support it.<div><br></div><div>However, a group of researchers have been working toward a version of Open MPI that supports the last fault tolerance proposal submitted for consideration to the MPI Forum.
