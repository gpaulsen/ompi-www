Both machines are x86_64, although one is a single quad core and the other is a dual quad core, the RH installs are the same. ompi and the other program were both statically linked. After the compiles I copied the target dirs to the new machine and hoped they would run, the program I wish to run passes all its self tests except the parallel ones. One thing is that there is a previous install of opmi on the machine, ideally I woulkd like to keep that installed as it runs with other stuff. The reason I am doing this is because I have the optimized compiler installed on only one machine. I will try np -1. <br><br>Ben &nbsp; <br><br>&gt; Date: Sat, 14 Mar 2009 18:07:32 +0900<br>&gt; From: rwan@kuicr.kyoto-u.ac.jp<br>&gt; To: users@open-mpi.org<br>&gt; Subject: Re: [OMPI users] Compiling ompi for use on another machine<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Hi Ben,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; ben rodriguez wrote:<br>&gt; &gt; I have compiled ompi and another program for use on another rhel5/x86_64 machine, after transfering the binaries and setting up environment variables is there anything else I need to do for ompi to run properly?

Is there any reason why you cannot compile on the other machine too?  (Sometimes the location of dynamic libraries, etc. changes so I try to make a note to always recompile on each machine.)  Are you having problems running your program on each node individually first?  If not, you might try that first (i.e., with "--np 1").<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Ray<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; users mailing list<br>&gt; users@open-mpi.org<br>&gt; http://www.open-mpi.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/users<br><br /><hr />Express your personality in color!
