    I have to agree with Jeff, we really need a complete program to
    really debug this.&nbsp; Note, without really seeing what the structures
    look like it is hard to determine if maybe there is some type of

I am comparing the results by seeing the printed messages, given by the printfs.... 

the recv_packet.rank is the rank of the sender that should be equal to status.MPI_SOURCE but it is not. 

I have updated the code a little bit, here is it.

if( (is_receiver == 1) &amp;&amp; (is_sender != 1) )
    {
        printf("\nP%d &gt;&gt; Receiver only ...!!", myid);
        printf("\n");

        printf("\nP%d &gt;&gt; Received from P%d, packet contains rank: %d", myid, status.MPI_SOURCE, recv_packet.rank);
        printf("\n");
    }
    else if( (is_sender == 1) &amp;&amp; (is_receiver != 1) )
    {

        load_packet.ld = load;
        printf("\nP%d &gt;&gt; Sender only ...!! P%d", myid, rec_rank);
        printf("\n");
        MPI_Ssend(&amp;load_packet, 1, loadDatatype, rec_rank, MPI_TAG_LOAD, comm);
    }
    else if( (is_receiver == 1) &amp;&amp; (is_sender == 1) )
    {
        load_packet.rank = myid;
        load_packet.ld = load;
        printf("\nP%d &gt;&gt; Both ...!! P%d", myid, rec_rank);

A process can be a message sender, or receiver or both. There are 16 ranks. "rec_rank" contains the rank of the receiver. It is displayed before the message is sent. 
Every sender displays this "rec_rank" and it should correctly. But on the receiver sides, status.MPI_SOURCE is displayed (after receiving message), but the value 
is not matching with the expected sender's rank.

This shows to me that messages on the receiving sides are captured on the basis of MPI_ANY_SOURCE, that seems like it does not see the destination of message while capturing it from message queue of the MPI system.

Yes, processes receive messages that were not sent to them. I am receiving the message with the following call

MPI_Recv(&amp;recv_packet, 1, loadDatatype, MPI_ANY_SOURCE, MPI_TAG_LOAD, comm, &amp;status);

and that was sent using the following call,

MPI_Ssend(&amp;load_packet, 1, loadDatatype, rec_rank, MPI_TAG_LOAD, comm);

What problem it can have ?. All the parameters are correct, I have seen them by printf.  What I am thinking is that, the receive is done with MPI_ANY_SOURCE, so the process is getting any message (from any source). What should be done so that only that message is captured that had the destination as this process.

          <pre wrap="">By virtue of MPI the MPI_Recv call should only return messages destined for that rank.  What makes you think that is not happening?  Can you make some sort of kernel of code that proves your theory that your MPI_Recv is receiving another rank's message?  If you can and then post that code maybe we'll be able to figure out what the issue is.

Right now, it seems we are at a deadlock of you claiming something is happening that really cannot be happening.  So unless we have more than a broad description of the problem it is going to be nearly impossible for us to tell you what is wrong.

Well MPI_Recv does give you the message that was sent specifically to 
the rank calling it by any of the processes in the communicator.  If you 
think the message you received should have gone to another rank then 
there is a bug somewhere.  I would start by either adding debugging 
printf's to your code to trace the messages.  Or narrowing down the 
code to a small kernel such that you can prove to yourself that MPI is 
working the way it should and if not you can show us where it is going 
wrong.

Mudassar,

You can do what you are asking.  The receiver uses MPI_ANY_SOURCE for
the source rank value and when you receive a message the
status.MPI_SOURCE will contain the rank of the actual sender not the
receiver's rank.  If you are not seeing that then there is a bug 
somewhere.

             I can not specify the rank of the sender. Because only
the sender knows to which receiver the message is to be sent. The
receiver does not know from which sender the message will come. I am
trying to do a research work on load balancing in MPI application
where load is redistributed, so in that I require a receiver to
receive a load value from a sender that it does not know. On the other
hand, the sender actually calculates, to which receiver this load
value should be sent. So for this, I want sender to send a message
containing the load to a receiver, but receiver does not know from
which sender the message will come. See, it is like send receiver in
DATAGRAM sockets. The receiver, receives the message on the IP and
port, the message which was directed for it. I want to have same
behavior. But it seems that it is not possible in MPI. Isn't it?

Right.  I thought you were asking about receiving *another* message
from whomever you just received from via ANY_SOURCE.

If you want to receive from a specific sender, you just specify the
rank you want to receive from -- not ANY_SOURCE.

You will always only receive messages that were sent to *you*.
There's no MPI_SEND_TO_ANYONE_WHO_IS_LISTENING functionality, for
example.  So your last statement: "But when it captures with ..
MPI_ANY_SOURCE and MPI_ANY_TAG, the receiver will capture any message
(even not targetted for it)" is incorrect.

I guess I still don't understand your question...?
