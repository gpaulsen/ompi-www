Jeff, you were right. I did a series of Spawns and consecutive Merges
and forgot to set the exception handler with the newly created
intra-communicators. Since these properties obviously are not inherited
(which would be kind of hard considering that there are multiple
communicators to be merged), the default non-exception-throwing handler
was installed.<br>

Thanks!<br>

That is correct; MPI states that the default error handler is  
MPI_ERRORS_ABORT.

Sure; change the default error handler on the communicator in which  
you are using in the call to COMM_SPAWN.

I don't know if we have checked this particular code path to ensure  
that OMPI will be stable after this, but it might work...

guess this is not implemented. Is there a technical (e.g.  
architectural)
reason behind this, or simply a yet-to-be-added feature?

The MPI layer is written in C; it will not throw exceptions unless you  
use the MPI C++ bindings to enable the MPI::ERRORS_THROW_EXCEPTIONS  
error handler.  Also be sure to use the right compiler flags to enable  
the C compiler to propagate C++ exceptions when you configure/build  
Open MPI via the --enable-cxx-exceptions flag (it's not enabled by  
default because it imposes a slight performance penalty).
