Hello,<br><br>I&#39;m new to MPI and I&#39;ve got a question about blocking routines like the Send-, Wait-Function and so on. I wrote a parallel program that uses the blocking Send and the Nonblocking Isend function. Now my question: If I&#39;m sending something with the blocking Send function it should block the process until the other process received the message. I think that works so far. But I&#39;m also sending a message to the process itself and my programm doesn&#39;t block. So does MPI not block if I&#39;m sending a message to the same process from which I&#39;m sending the message and it is a blocking routine? The same happens if I&#39;m sending with a non-blocking Isend and do a request.Wait() on the send request after each send operation. So it doesn&#39;t block if I&#39;m sending the message to itself. I&#39;m wondering about that because the Recv function will occur only after all messages have been sent. It&#39;s ok that it works, because I need to send a message to the process itself for simplicity. I&#39;m only wondering why this works.<br>
<br>Another question I have is about a memory leak. I got a heavy memory leak if I did not a request.Wait() on the send request before the Isend function and didn&#39;t wait until the last Isend operation completed. But all messages were arrived if I do the request.Wait() or not. Now I&#39;m doing a request.Wait() before each Isend function and my memory isn&#39;t increasing much, but still a bit. Do I have to do something else on the blocking Send function? And is there a function in MPI to clean up its buffers in a running application without using the Finalize function.<br>
<br>Thank you for your help so far.<br><br>Greets,<br>Simon<br>
