        <div>I have been using openMPI for my application with intel
          visual fortran. The version that I am currently using is
          openMPI-1.6.2. It works fine iwth fortran code compiled in
          32bit and run it with openMPI 32 bit files. However recently I
          moved to a 64 bit machine and even though I could compile the
          code successfully with intel fortran 64 bit and also pointing
          the openMPI to the corresponding 64 bit files, the exe would
          not start and threw the error:</div>
        <div><b>the application was unable to start correctly (0x00007b)</b><br>
        </div>
        <div><b><br>
          </b></div>
        <div>This is because the msvcr100d.dll file (this is required by
          openMPI even when I run in 32bit mode) is a 32 bit dll file
          and it probably requires 64 bit equivalent. I could not find
          any 64 bit equivalent for this dll.&nbsp;</div>
        <div>My question is why is openMPI looking for this dll file
          (even in case of 32bit compilation). Can i do away with this
          dependency or is there any way I can run it in 64 bit?</div>

    64-bit Windows of course includes full 32-bit support, so you might
    still run your 32-bit MPI application.<br>
    You would need a full 64-bit build of the MPI libraries for
    compatibility with your 64-bit application.&nbsp; I haven't seen any
    indication that anyone is supporting openmpi for ifort Windows
    64-bit.&nbsp; The closest openmpi thing seems to be the cygwin
    (gcc/gfortran) build.&nbsp; Windows seems to be too crowded for so many
    MPI versions to succeed.<br>
