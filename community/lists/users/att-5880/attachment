I am having trouble building mpif77/mpif90 with gfortran on Mac OS 10.5. Or maybe just running. The configure, make all, and make install seemed to go just fine, finding my gfortran and apparently using it, but the scripts mpif77 and mpif90 give the error that my openmpi was not built with fortran bindings. Mpicc and mpicxx don&#8217;t give this error. &nbsp;Ompi_info says the f77 and f90 bindings were built.<BR>
<BR>
I know that OS X 10.5 comes with openmpi mpicc and mpicxx installed, but not fortran bindings, and I was careful to put the openmpi I built first in the path.<BR>
<BR>
Some run output (mpif77 &#8212;version, ompi_info), config.log, configure.log, make.out, make-install.out are in the attached tarball.<BR>
<BR>
Any clues?<BR>
<BR>
Thanks,<BR>
