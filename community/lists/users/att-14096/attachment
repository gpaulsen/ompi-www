<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">Network saturation could produce arbitrary
long delays the total data load we are talking about is really small. &nbsp;It
is the responsibility of an MPI library to do one of the following:</font>
<br>
<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">1) Use a reliable message protocol for
each message (e.g. Infiniband RC or TCP/IP)</font>
<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">2) detect lost packets and retransmit
them if the protocol is un-reliable (E.G. Infiniband UD or UDP/IP)</font>
<br>
<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">It is the responsibility of an MPI library
to manage any MPI or system buffers to prevent over run. That is why I
mention that 1/2 MB messages would use rendezvous protocol. &nbsp;The send
side would push a descriptor (called an envelop) to the receive side. The
receive side would push back an OK_to_send once a matching receive was
posted. &nbsp;The 1/2 MB message data would not begin to flow across the
network until the receive buffer was known. </font>
<br>
<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">It is also the responsibility of an
MPI library to detect when MPI level messages have become undeliverable
and fail the job.</font>
<br>
<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">Bugs are always a possibility but unless
there is something very unusual about the cluster and interconnect or this
is an unstable version of MPI, it seems very unlikely this use of MPI_Bcast
with so few tasks and only a 1/2 MB message would trip on one. &nbsp;80
tasks is a very small number in modern parallel computing. &nbsp;Thousands
of tasks involved in an MPI collective has become pretty standard.</font>

&gt; I have had a similar load related problem with Bcast. &nbsp;I don't
know <br>
&gt; what caused it though. &nbsp;With this one, what about the possibility
of<br>
&gt; a buffer overrun or network saturation?<br>
