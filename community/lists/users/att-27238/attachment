<div dir="ltr"><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div>Hi all,<br><br></div>Hopefully this mail gets posted in the right thread...<br><br></div>I have noticed the (I guess same) leak using OpenMPI 1.8.6 with LAMMPS, a molecular dynamics program, without any use of CUDA. I am not that familiar with how the internal memory management of LAMMPS works, but it does not appear CUDA-related.<br><br></div>The symptoms are the same:<br>OpenMPI 1.8.5: everything is fine<br></div>OpenMPI 1.8.6: same setup, pretty large leak<br><br></div>Unfortunately, I have no idea how to isolate the bug, but to reproduce it:<br>1. clone LAMMPS (git clone git://<a href="http://git.lammps.org/lammps-ro.git">git.lammps.org/lammps-ro.git</a> lammps)<br></div>2. cd src/, compile with openMPI 1.8.6<br></div>3. run the example listed in lammps/examples/melt<br><br></div><div>I would like to help find this bug but I am not sure what would help. LAMMPS itself is pretty big so I can imagine you might not want to go through all of the code...<br></div><br></div>
