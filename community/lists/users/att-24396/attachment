If so, I don't know if anyone built/posted a 64-bit release version for Windows (you might check the OMPI site and see if there is something specific for 64-bit), and we don't support Windows directly any more. You might also look at the cygwin site for a downloadable version that runs under cygwin.<div><br></div><div><br><div><div>On May 15, 2014, at 12:13 PM, Ajay Nair &lt;<a href="mailto:prodigyaj@gmail.com">prodigyaj@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:</div><br class="Apple-interchange-newline"><blockquote type="cite"><div dir="ltr">Hi,<div><br></div><div>I have been using openMPI for my application with intel visual fortran. The version that I am currently using is openMPI-1.6.2. It works fine iwth fortran code compiled in 32bit and run it with openMPI 32 bit files. However recently I moved to a 64 bit machine and even though I could compile the code successfully with intel fortran 64 bit and also pointing the openMPI to the corresponding 64 bit files, the exe would not start and threw the error:</div>
<div><b>the application was unable to start correctly (0x00007b)</b><br></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>This is because the msvcr100d.dll file (this is required by openMPI even when I run in 32bit mode) is a 32 bit dll file and it probably requires 64 bit equivalent. I could not find any 64 bit equivalent for this dll.&nbsp;</div>
<div>My question is why is openMPI looking for this dll file (even in case of 32bit compilation). Can i do away with this dependency or is there any way I can run it in 64 bit?</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks</div><div>AJ</div>
