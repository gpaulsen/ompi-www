I was simply agreeing with Maxime about why it could work. ;)

But if you and the other devels are fine with it, i'm fine too.

FWIW, simply for my own curiosity's sake, if someone could confirm deny whether cmake:

1. Supports the following compiler suites: GNU (that's a given, I assume), Clang, OS X native (which is variants of GNU and Clang), Absoft, PGI, Intel, Cray, HP-UX, Oracle Solaris (Linux and Solaris), Tru64, Microsoft Visual, IBM BlueGene (I think that's gcc, but am not entirely sure).  (some of these matter mainly to hwloc, not necessarily OMPI)

    I have built projects with CMake using GNU, Intel, PGI, OS X native.
    CMake claims to make MSV projects, so I'm assuming MS Visual works.
    I can't say about the others.<br>

2. Bootstrap a tarball such that an end user does not need to have cmake installed.

    That, I have no clue, but they do have a page about bootstrapping
    cmake itself<br>

    I am not sure if this is what you mean.<br>

    If there is no existing CMake installation, a bootstrap script is
    provided: <br>
    <br>
    <div id="textboxstyle">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;./bootstrap<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make install</div>
    <br>
    (Note: the make install step is optional, cmake will run from the
    build directory.) <br>
    <br>
    According to this, you could have a tarball including CMake and
    instruct the users to run some variant of (or make your own
    bootstrap script including this)<br>
    &nbsp;./bootstrap &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; ./cmake . &amp;&amp; make
    &amp;&amp; make install<br>
    <br>
    Now that I think about it, OpenFOAM uses CMake and bootstraps it if
    it is not install, so it is certainly possible.<br>
