<br>Hi all, <br><br>I am new to Open MPI mailing list. Just started using it for our proprietary interconnect<br><br>which uses uDAPL1.2 as underling network.<br><br>As our experience with other open source MPI2 implementation libraries, they are deprecating udapl ADI.<br>
<br>and giving more n more support/enhancement to gen2 ADI.<br><br>So we are thinking to move to OpenMPI, before that we want to confirm these thing with you people.<br><br>Thanking,<br>Nilesh Awate<br>C-DAC, India<br><br>
