<div>Dear All</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have a Dell Cluster running Platform Cluster Manager (PCM) , the compute nodes are NFS mounted with the master node. Storage (SAN) is mounted to the installer node only, the problem is that I am running a programme which uses data which resides on Storage , so as far as running the program on master node is concerned there is no problem but when I mpirun across other nodes they are not able to find the paths (as the Storage partitions are not mounted to the compute nodes). I have made symbolic links on the installer node but the compute nodes are showing red color sysmbolic links. Please advise how to reslove this issue</div>

<div> </div>
<div>Best Regards</div>
