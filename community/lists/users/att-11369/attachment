Hello all,<br><br>I&#39;m developing an groundwater simulation application that will use openmpi to distribute the data and solve a linear system. The problem is that my primary data structure is composed of a base class and derived classes, and they are inserted in a boost ptr_vector, as they are of different class types, with<a style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);" href="goog_1259695724977" class="spell"></a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></span> inheritance and pointers to other members of the vector. I would like to pass parts of this vector to the processes, to build locally the matrix, but I don&#39;t know how to do it. I followed the discussion on this thread (<a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/users/2009/07/9852.php">http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/users/2009/07/9852.php</a>), and the route to use boost.MPI the only way out? <br>

<br>I can provide the class template, if this would help. I&#39;m using openmpi 1.3.3 on debian sid amd64. <br><br clear="all">Ivan Marin<br><br>Laboratório de Hidráulica Computacional - LHC<br>Departamento de Hidráulica e Saneamento - SHS<br>
