<html><head><style type="text/css"><!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --></style></head><body><div style="font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt"><DIV>Hi all,</DIV>
<DIV>I use openmpi-1.3b3r20000 and blcr-0.7.3 to run my application on 2 nodes. I configure openmpi to run on 2 nodes for default. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;I want to use checkpoint/restart functionalities, so I use this command to configure openmpi:</DIV>
<DIV># .configure --with-devel-headers --with-ft=cr --with-blcr=&lt;path_to_blcr&gt;</DIV>
<DIV>First: I run application well with this command "mpitun -np 4 &lt;my_app&gt;", but after checkpoint I can't restart application. The error return is bus error, signal 7. To fix it, you tell me add "-mca btl ^sm" to mpirun, it run well. But I want to know why. </DIV>
<DIV>Second: I can't checkpoint application with --term option. Checkpoint command not return, snapshot be created but it wasn't returned to localhost. Daemon on remote node died before local snapshot returned, but processes on localhost not die.</DIV>
<DIV>Third: When I restart an application, I can't checkpoint this. Checkpoint command not return and restart process died with signal 13 (Broken Pipe).</DIV>
<DIV>With my first-class experience, I can't understand why, please help me.</DIV>
<DIV>Thank you</DIV>
<DIV>Catrina</DIV></div><br>
