Sorry, I didn't see your prior question glad you found the
btl_openib_receive_queues parameter.  There is not a faq entry for this
but I found the following in the openib btl help file that spells out
the parameters when using Per-peer receive queue (ie receive queue
setting with "P" as the first argument).<br>
<br>
Per-peer receive queues require between 2 and 5 parameters:<br>
<br>
 1. Buffer size in bytes (mandatory)<br>
 2. Number of buffers (mandatory)<br>
 3. Low buffer count watermark (optional; defaults to (num_buffers / 2))<br>
 4. Credit window size (optional; defaults to (low_watermark / 2))<br>
 5. Number of buffers reserved for credit messages (optional;<br>
     defaults to (num_buffers*2-1)/credit_window)<br>
<br>
 Example: P,128,256,128,16<br>
  - 128 byte buffers<br>
  - 256 buffers to receive incoming MPI messages<br>
  - When the number of available buffers reaches 128, re-post 128 more<br>
    buffers to reach a total of 256<br>
  - If the number of available credits reaches 16, send an explicit<br>
    credit message to the sender<br>
  - Defaulting to ((256 * 2) - 1) / 16 = 31; this many buffers are<br>
    reserved for explicit credit messages<br>

  <pre wrap="">Hi: In response to my own question, by studying the file
mca-btl-openib-device-params.ini, I discovered that this option in
OMPI-1.4.2:

-mca btl_openib_receive_queues P,65536,256,192,128

was sufficient to prevent OMPI from trying to create shared receive
queues and allowed my application to run to completion using the IB
hardware.

I guess my question now is: What do these numbers mean? Presumably the
size (or counts?) of buffers to allocate? Are there limits or a way to
tune these values?

Thanks,
Allen

    <pre wrap="">Hi Terry:
It is indeed the case that the openib BTL has not been initialized. I
ran with your tcp-disabled MCA option and it aborted in MPI_Init.

The OFED stack is what's included in RHEL4. It appears to be made up of
the RPMs:
openib-1.4-1.el4
opensm-3.2.5-1.el4
libibverbs-1.1.2-1.el4

How can I determine if srq is supported? Is there an MCA option to
defeat it? (Our in-house cluster has more recent Mellanox IB hardware
and is running this same IB stack and ompi 1.4.2 works OK, so I suspect
srq is supported by the OpenFabrics stack. Perhaps.)

Thanks,
Allen

      <pre wrap="">My guess is from the message below saying "(openib) BTL failed to
initialize"  that the code is probably running over tcp.  To
absolutely prove this you can specify to only use the openib, sm and
self btls to eliminate the tcp btl.  To do that you add the following
to the mpirun line "-mca btl openib,sm,self".  I believe with that
specification the code will abort and not run to completion.  

What version of the OFED stack are you using?  I wonder if srq is
supported on your system or not?

 When the OMPI application is run, it prints the error message:

--------------------------------------------------------------------
The OpenFabrics (openib) BTL failed to initialize while trying to
create an internal queue.  This typically indicates a failed
OpenFabrics installation, faulty hardware, or that Open MPI is
attempting to use a feature that is not supported on your hardware
(i.e., is a shared receive queue specified in the
btl_openib_receive_queues MCA parameter with a device that does not
support it?).  The failure occured here:

  Local host:  machine001.lan
  OMPI
source: /software/openmpi-1.4.2/ompi/mca/btl/openib/btl_openib.c:250
  Function:    ibv_create_srq()
  Error:       Invalid argument (errno=22)
  Device:      mthca0

You may need to consult with your system administrator to get this
problem fixed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The full log of a run with "btl_openib_verbose 1" is attached. My
application appears to run to completion, but I can't tell if it's just
running on TCP and not using the IB hardware.

I would appreciate any suggestions on how to proceed to fix this error.

Thanks,
Allen
