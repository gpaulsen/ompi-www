<div>hello everyone,</div>
<div>i have a network of systems connected over lan with each computer running ubuntu. openmpi 1.4.x is installed on 1 machine and the installation is mounted on other nodes through Networking File System(NFS). the source program and compiled file(a.out) are present in the mounted directory</div>

<div>i run my programs by the following command:</div>
<div>/opt/project/bin/mpirun -np 4 --prefix  /opt/project/ --hostfile hostfile a.out</div>
<div>i have not set LD_LIBRARY_PATH but as i use --prefix mpirun works successfully</div>
<div> </div>
<div>however as per the open mpi debugging faq: <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=debugging">http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=debugging</a></div>
<div>when i run </div>
<div>
<div>/opt/project/bin/mpirun -np 4 --prefix  /opt/project/ --hostfile hostfile -x DISPLAY=10.0.0.1:0.0 xterm -e gdb a.out</div>
<div> </div>
<div>4 xterm windows are opened with gdb running as expected. however when i give the command start to gdb in the windows corresponding to remote nodes, i get the error:</div>
<div>libmpi.so.0 not found: no such file/directory</div>
<div> </div>
<div>as mentioned other mpi jobs run fine with mpirun</div>
<div> </div>
<div>when i execute 
<div>/opt/project/bin/mpirun -np 4 --prefix  /opt/project/ -x DISPLAY=10.0.0.1:0.0 xterm -e gdb a.out ,the debugging continues succesfully</div>
<div> </div>
<div>please help</div></div></div>
