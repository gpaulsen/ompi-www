Hello everyone,<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
I'm a new student at my university, and I need to install LAMMPS software to perform some molecular dynamic simulations for my work. The cluster&nbsp;I am working on has no root access for me (obviously) and I am installing everything on my local account. I'm having some difficulty installing LAMMPS on my cluster home account. I downloaded and installed openmpi, and had to edit ~/.bashrc to add the line:<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
export PATH=/home/ras536/bin/openmpi/bin/:${PATH}<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
To get it to recognize that I had installed mpic++ and etc. Upon doing this, I run:<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
$ mpic++<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
And I will succesfully obtain the message:<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
g++: no input files<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
So, I think, everything is fine with my openmpi1.1 (LAMMPS requieres this)&nbsp;installation. However, when I try to make LAMMPS using:<BR>
<BR>$ make openmpi <BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
I get errors like this:<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
mpic++ -O2 -funroll-loops -fstrict-aliasing -Wall -W -Wno-uninitialized&nbsp; -DLAMMPS_GZIP&nbsp;&nbsp; -DFFT_FFTW&nbsp;&nbsp; -c memory.cpp<BR>mpic++ -O2 -funroll-loops -fstrict-aliasing -Wall -W -Wno-uninitialized&nbsp; -DLAMMPS_GZIP&nbsp;&nbsp; -DFFT_FFTW&nbsp;&nbsp; -c min_cg.cpp<BR>mpic++ -O2 -funroll-loops -fstrict-aliasing -Wall -W -Wno-uninitialized&nbsp; -DLAMMPS_GZIP&nbsp;&nbsp; -DFFT_FFTW&nbsp;&nbsp; -c min.cpp<BR>min.cpp: In member function âvoid LAMMPS_NS::Min::force_clear()â:<BR>min.cpp:547: warning: unused variable âiâ<BR><BR>
And furthermore, upon trying to use the executable:<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
./lmp_yotta <BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
I get this:<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
./lmp_yotta: error while loading shared libraries: liborte.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
Any idea what might be going on? Am I missing linking stuff so that LAMMPS building can proceed fine?<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
Thanks for the help,<BR> 		 	   		  </div></body>
