First and foremost the two datatype markers (MPI_LB and MPI_UB) have been<br>
deprecated from MPI 3.0 for exactly the reason you encountered. Once a<br>
datatype is annotated with these markers, they are propagated to all<br>
derived types, leading to an unnatural datatype definition. This behavior<br>
is enforced by the definition of the typemap specified by the equation on<br>
Section 4.1 page 105 line 18. Unfortunately, the only way to circumvent<br>
this issue, is to manually set the UB to all newly created datatypes.<br>

I see I should have directly checked the specification to see what the<br>
expected behavior was, instead of relying on (apparently over-)<br>
simplified summaries from web searches and books.Â  Thanks for the<br>
pointer!<br>
<br>
I&#39;d wondered if this was a fixable bug, but it looks like that<br>
equation dates back to at *least* 1994 and the MPI-1.0 spec; clearly<br>
the only thing to do was deprecate and replace the API rather than<br>
breaking old user code to enforce the &quot;right&quot; behavior instead.<br>

Thus, to fix your datatype composition you just have to add an explicit<br>
MPI_LB (set to 0) when calling the MPI_Type_struct on your second struct<br>
datatype.<br>

<br>
I&#39;d managed to hit on this solution by guesswork, but it&#39;s quite a<br>
relief to know that its correctness is actually mandated by the MPI<br>
standand not just my dumb luck.<br>
<br>
Thanks again,<br>
