<div text="#000000" bgcolor="#ffffff">I agree with Bill that performance portability is an issue.  That is, the MPI standard itself doesn&#39;t really provide any guarantees here about what is fastest.  Perhaps polling this mailing list will be helpful, but if you are looking for &quot;the fastest&quot; solution regardless of which MPI implementation you use (and which interconnect you use... which might be determined at run time) you will probably be disappointed.<br>

<div>I was afraid that was going to be the case :-( So if I&#39;m concerned about being network-BW-bound and being performant on different types of architectures I should design my application such that it is able to use any of the above communication patterns such that I can tell the app which comm-pattern to use depending on the middleware/hardware it will run on (to optimise for BW usage) ?</div>
