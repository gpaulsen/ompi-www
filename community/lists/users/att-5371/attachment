I have to admit<br>&gt;&gt; that you lost me about half way through the thread.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; I was able to get 2 of my systems cranked up and was about to put a<br>&gt;&gt; third system online when I remembered it was running x64 version of<br>&gt;&gt; OS.<br>&gt;&gt; Can I just recompile the code on the x64 system and put it in the<br>&gt;&gt; same home directory used by all the systems? I'm not sharing the<br>&gt;&gt; directory across systems, but after doing this three or four times<br>&gt;&gt; across just 2 systems, I can see why sharing would be advantages.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; users mailing list<br>&gt; users_at_[hidden]<br>&gt; http://www.open-mpi.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/users <br><div><font face="Verdana" size="2"></font></div>
