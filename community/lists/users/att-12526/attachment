These hosts are actually on AMD Opteron dual socket Quad core with 2 cores assigned to each host/domain.<br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">mpirun --prefix /root/xentools/openmpi-gcc/ -mca
 plm_rsh_agent ssh --host localhost, xenguest1 -np 4 
/root/xentools/hello</span><br><br>I am able to run mpirun successfully when I launch this command from one of the guests and also when i lauch this command on dom0 (localhost)&nbsp; alone. But when i launch mpirun from the Dom 0 on one or more guests there is no response from the guests and I am eventually having to kill the process which reports saying <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xenguest1 - daemon did not report back when launched<br><br>Can someone point out where I am going wrong. I have seen people having similar problem in the list but no one posted how they got around this problem.<br><br>Note: I also tried setting the default agent launcher to ssh. Also, on every host the directory structure is exactly the same and also the Library paths and paths are also set up properly and the executable is also present at the exact same location..<br><br>Thanks,<br>Rohan Nigam<br>Research Asst, <br>Univ. of
