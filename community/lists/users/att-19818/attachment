I have a purely parallel job that runs ~100 processes. Each process has ~identical <br>overhead so the speed of the program is dominated by the slowest processor.<br> <br>For this reason, I would like to restrict the job to a specific set of identical (fast)<br>
processors on our cluster.<br>
<br>I read the FAQ on -hosts and -hostfile, but it is still unclear to me what affect these <br>directives will have in a queuing environment.<br><br>Currently, I submit the job using the &quot;qsub&quot; command in the &quot;sge&quot; environment as :<br>
<br>            qsub -pe mpich 101 jobfile.job<br><br>where jobfile contains the command<br><br>            mpirun -np 101 -nolocal ./executable<br clear="all">
<br>I would like to restrict the job to nodes compute-5-1 to compute-5-32 on our machine, <br>each containing 8 cpu&#39;s (slots). How do I go about this?<br><br>Thanks, Erik<br><br>-- <br>Erik Nelson<br><br>Howard Hughes Medical Institute<br>
