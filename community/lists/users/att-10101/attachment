Most likely problem is version confusion as Fedora comes with a version of OMPI pre-installed. Check you LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PATH on both ends to ensure they are pointing at the same OMPI installation. Remember, interactive login typically uses a different shell startup then non-interactive job launch, so be sure that the latter is getting the right path.<br>
<br>Also, be sure you don&#39;t have a firewall running between the two computers.<br><br>What version of OMPI are you trying to install?<br><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Mon, Jul 27, 2009 at 9:35 AM, jacob Balthazor <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:jcb344@gmail.com">jcb344@gmail.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br>
