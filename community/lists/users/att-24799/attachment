    Is this something that could be funded by Microsoft, and is it time
    to approach them perhaps?&nbsp; MS MPI is based on MPICH, and if mainline
    MPICH isn't supporting Windows anymore, then there won't be a whole
    lot of development in an increasingly older Windows build.&nbsp; With the
    Open-MPI roadmap, there's a lot happening.&nbsp; Would it be a better
    business model for MS to piggy-back off of Open-MPI ongoing
    innovation, and put their resources into maintaining a Windows build
    of Open-MPI instead?<br>

Seems to average at least once a week.  We also see regular petsc
support emails wondering why --download-{mpich,openmpi} does not work on
Windows.  (These options are pretty much only used by beginners for whom
PETSc is their first encounter with MPI.)
