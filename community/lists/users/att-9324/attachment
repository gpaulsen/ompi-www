<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" ><tr><td valign="top" style="font: inherit;">Dear,<br><br>&nbsp;I intend to override some MPI functions such as MPI_Init, MPI_Recv... but I don't want to dig into OpenMPI source code.Therefore, I am thinking of a way to<span style="font-weight: bold;"> create a lib called "mympi.h" in which I will #include "mpi.h" to override those functions</span>. I will <span style="font-weight: bold;">create a new interface with exactly the same signatures like MPI_Init</span> (because users are familiar with those functions). However, the problem is that I don't know how to override those functions because as I know, C/C++ doesn't allow us to override functions (only overload them).<br><br>&nbsp;Could you please show me how to override OMPI functions but still keep the same function names and signatures?<br><br>&nbsp;Thank you so much for your time and consideration<br><br>Le , Duy Khanh<br>Cellphone:
