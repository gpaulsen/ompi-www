Is it possible that this could be a problem with /usr/lib64 as opposed
to /usr/lib?<br>

Just a thought...<br>

  <pre wrap="">Hi, Edgar and Galen,

Thanks for the quick reply!

What puzzles me is that, on 32 bit OpenSUSE, I was able to compile elmer
solver without any issue using the same script.  I am planning to use
HYPRE library, but, configure file indicated that it cannot find hypre
either which is another puzzle to me.  I will look into this further.

Best,

pei

I doubt that this has to do anything with the platform. We are running 
here Open MPI on a 64bit architecture using SuSe 10.2  since quite a 
while successfully. However, you configure log is indicating, the 
parpack could not be found, so you might have to change the CFLAGS and 
LDFLAGS in order for you configure script to find the according library.
