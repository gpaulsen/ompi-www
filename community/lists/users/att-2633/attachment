<P><FONT face="Times New Roman">Hello All,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman">We are in the process to decide, if we should 
use Open MPI in an AIX environment.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman">Our in-house&nbsp;testing indicates that OMPI (V 
1.1.x and V 1.2.x) stdio is broken under AIX.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman">At this point, I am trying to find out if there 
is a fix or work-around for this problem. I have put another </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman">posting (see attached). One recommendation was 
try pre-release of V 1.2, which didn't make any difference.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman">I am hoping that an OMPI developer 
or&nbsp;someone from IBM&nbsp;come up with a solution.&nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman">Open MPI documentation, indicates that AIX is 
being supported, with limited testing before each release.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman">What is limited testing? Does it mean, 
Configure, Install and running "Hello World" on one node? </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman">In short, we did configure and installed&nbsp; V 
1.1.x as well as V1.2.x, but attempt to running</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman">a simple test such as "mpirun -np 1 hostname", 
fails, see attached for more details.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman">I have eight&nbsp; nodes IBM systems, I could

<P>I have installed Open MPI 1.1.2&nbsp; on IBM AIX 5.3 cluster. It looks like 
</P>
<P>terminal output is broken. There are a few entry in the OpenMPI archive for 
this problem, </P>
<P>with no suggested solution or real work around. </P>
<P>I am putting this posting with hope to get some advise for a work around or 
solution. </P>
<P>#mpirun -np 1 hostname </P>
<P>No out put, piping the command to "cat" or "more" generate no out put as 
well. </P>
<P>The only way to get an output from this command is to add --debug-daemons 
</P>
<P>#mpirun -np 1 --debug-daemons hostname </P>
<P>Even this debug option is not working for a real application which generate 
several output. </P>
<P>Looking forward for any comments. </P>
<P>Thanks </P></FONT></DIV></BODY></HTML>
