&gt; When MPI_Bcast and MPI_Reduce are called for the first time, they<br>
&gt; are very slow. But after that, they run at normal and stable speed.<br>
&gt; Is there anybody out there who have encountered such problem? If you<br>
&gt; need any other information, please let me know and I'll provide.<br>
&gt; Thanks in advance.<br>

This is expected, and I think you can dig though the message archive<br>
to find the answer. &nbsp;OMPI does not wireup all the communication at<br>
startup, thus the first time you communicate with a host the<br>
connection is made, but after that it is fast because it is already<br>
open. &nbsp;This behavior is expected, and is needed for very large systems<br>
where you could run out of sockets for some types of communication<br>
with so many hosts.<br>

<br>Thanks for your reply. I am surprised to know this is an expected behavior of OMPI. I searched the archival but did not find many relevant messages. I am wondering why other users of OMPI do not complain this. Is there a way to avoid this when timing an MPI program?</blockquote>
