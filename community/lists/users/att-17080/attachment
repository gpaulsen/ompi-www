Dear all,<br><br>Where could I find a detailed documentation about algorithms that has been using in Open MPI ? <br><br>For
 example, I would like to answer following questions: how MPI_Algather 
operation is done? what is the complexity in term of the number of data 
send/receive given a number of node involved? what is the data structure
 behind ?. Same as for MPI_Alreduce etc.. <br>
<br>Is this information available to access and how can I access it ? I 
know there is one way which is digging into the source code, but I hope 
there is a easier way to achieve the same goal.<br><br>Many Thanks,<br><font color="#888888">Vu.</font>
