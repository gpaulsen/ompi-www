<p>I have one MPI  job consisting of two  parts.  One is  &quot;foo_x86&quot;, the other is &quot;foo_ppc&quot;, and there is  MPI communication between &quot;foo_x86&quot; and &quot;foo_ppc&quot;.  <br>
   &quot;foo_x86&quot; is built on X86 box &quot;b1&quot;,   &quot;foo_pcc&quot; is built  on  PPC box &quot;b2&quot;.    Anyone can tell me how to start this MPI job?<br>
<br>
I tried &quot;mpirun   -np 1 foo_x86 : -np 1 foo_ppc  -H b1,b2&quot;<br>
<br>
I tried the above command on &quot;b1&quot;, the X86 box,   and  I got &quot;foo_ppc:  Exec Format error&quot;<br>
 I tired  on &quot;b2&quot;, the PPC box, and I got  &quot;foo_x86: Exec format error&quot;<br>
<br>
Anybody has a clue?   Thanks in advance.<br>
