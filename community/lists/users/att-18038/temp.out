I tried to run hello_c using mpiexec and received the following which I get earlier from other attempts.

amos@linux-ym6f:~/Downloads/openmpi-1.4.4/examples> mpiexec hello_c
[linux-ym6f:32043] [NO-NAME] ORTE_ERROR_LOG: Not found in file runtime/orte_init_stage1.c at line 182

It looks like orte_init failed for some reason; your parallel process is
likely to abort.  There are many reasons that a parallel process can
fail during orte_init; some of which are due to configuration or
environment problems.  This failure appears to be an internal failure;
here's some additional information (which may only be relevant to an
Open MPI developer):

  orte_rml_base_select failed
  --> Returned value -13 instead of ORTE_SUCCESS

Open RTE was unable to initialize properly.  The error occured while
attempting to orte_init().  Returned value -13 instead of ORTE_SUCCESS.
