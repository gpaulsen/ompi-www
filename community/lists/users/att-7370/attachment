Hello,<br>I have built an application using opemmpi 1.2.8 that is a client/server application that uses MPI_publish_name and MPI_Lookup_name to start the communication.<br>This application works fine on a single computer.<br>
However, i&#39;d like to run it on 2 pcs using linux (ubuntu) connected by a LAN.<br>If I start the server on a computer, my cliente can&#39;t find the name published by the server and crashes.<br>What should I do make this work?<br>
I believe that my application is correct, so I think I need to install some other service to make MPI see the other computer.<br>[]s<br><br>Heitor<br>
