What is the compile line that you are using to compile your application?

If you use &quot;mpif90 ...&quot;, then the right compiler directive should be automatically added such that the mpi module will be found (assuming that your OMPI was installed with F90 support, that is).

&gt; I have compiled all my fortran source files successfully with openmpi 1.4.3 wrapper for ifort on Ubuntu 10.10, except the main progran file that contains the &quot;include mpif.h&quot; statement. It seems that the &quot;include mpif.h&quot; is deprecated and that one should now use &quot;USE mpi&quot;. However, when compiling with this I get the following message:
&gt; 
&gt; Compile...
&gt; 3k-1.for(2): error #7002: Error in opening the compiled module file.  Check INCLUDE paths.   [MPI]

&gt; done
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;/usr/include/mpi&quot; is included in the variable $INCLUDE
&gt; 
&gt; Could someone please advise on the next step to take?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
