 commands.&nbsp; Everything appeared to work correctly.&nbsp; The problem is that when I try to compile a program with mpif90 I get an error saying that open-mpi was not built with fortran 90 support (the same happens with f77).&nbsp; I have looked everywhere in the faq's and cannot figure out why this is happening.&nbsp; The only thing that I can think is that when I tell the F90 wrapper to use gfortran it tells me that there are no flags in my compiler to compiler to compile .f and .f90 files; even though I can compile .f and .f90 files with my gfortran compiler.&nbsp; Any help would be very much appreciated.<br><br>Thanks in advance,<br>Chase<br></div></div><br>
