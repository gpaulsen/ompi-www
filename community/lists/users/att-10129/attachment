<div style="word-wrap: break-word;">Using direct can cause scaling issues as every process will open a socket to every other process in the job. You would at least have to ensure you have enough file descriptors available on every node.<div>

<br></div><div>The most likely cause is either (a) a different OMPI version getting picked up on one of the nodes, or (b) something blocking communication between at least one of your other nodes. I would suspect the latter - perhaps a firewall or something?</div>

<div><br></div><div>I&#39;&#39;m disturbed by your not seeing any error output - that seems strange. Try adding --debug-daemons to the cmd line. That should definitely generate output from every daemon (at the least, they report they are alive).</div>
