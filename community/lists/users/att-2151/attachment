<div>How does Open MPI use shared memory for communication between two processes on the same host meaning who creates the shared memory?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Both the processes running on the host have their own private buffers. So buf1 sent by Process 1 should reach buf2 of Process 2. How is this handled?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Is it that buf1 is first copied into Shared Memory allocated by Open MPI and then from shared memory into buf2 OR</div>
<div>is it that application (process) creates a Shared Memory and indicates to Open MPI to use this for communication with the other process on the same host OR is it that we have to use &quot;allocation&quot; routines provided by Open MPI and Open MPI internally makes&nbsp;all the memory as&nbsp;Shared so that processes on the same host can simply use it.
