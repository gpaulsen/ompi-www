Hi,<br><br>I am a new user to OpenMPI and I am using java version of OpenMPI. I have downloaded the nightly snapshot <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/nightly/trunk/openmpi-1.9a1r27802.tar.gz">openmpi-1.9a1r27802.tar.gz</a> form your web page. unfortunately, there are not enough documentation on your webpage for compiling and using java mpi programs. I have built openmpi on /usr/local:<br>
<a name="java_build"><br>./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-mpi-java </a><br>make all install<br><br>and <br><br>export LD_LIBRARY_PATH to /usr/local/lib/openmpi/<br><br>now, I can compile a simple program easily by <br>
<br>mpijavac -d dd Hello.java<br>mpirun -np 2 java dd/Hello.class<br><br>but when I am trying to run it with mpirun I get the following error:<br><br>mpirun: error while loading shared libraries: libopen-rte.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory<br>
<br>Could you please give me some directions. <br><br>I am using Ubuntu Linux 11.10 and I am going to use openmpi later in Hadoop.<br><br>Thanks,<br><br clear="all"><br>-- <br>Regards,<br>Karos
