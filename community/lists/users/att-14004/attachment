When my MPI code fails (seg fault), it usually cause the rest of the mpi process to abort as well.  Perhaps rather than calling abort(), perhaps you could do a divide-by-zero operation to halt the program?<br><br><div class="gmail_quote">

I&#39;ve got a mpi program that is supposed to to generate a core file if<br>
problems arise on any of the nodes.   I tried to do this by adding a<br>
call to abort() to my exit routines but this doesn&#39;t work; I get no core<br>
file, and worse, mpirun doesn&#39;t detect that one of my nodes has<br>
aborted(?) and doesn&#39;t kill off the entire job, except in the trivial<br>
case where the number of processors I&#39;m running on is 1.   I&#39;ve replaced<br>
abort with MPI_Abort, which kills everything off, but leaves no core<br>
file.  Any suggestions how I can get one and still have mpi exit?<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance.<br>
