Hi ,<br><br>We developed new OFED stack as for our requirements to our new product.Now it is needed to check the functionality of new OFED stack using MPI,used multi node setup to check this stack.But problem is we are not having no idea how to use OPEN-MPI tool to check our stack.I went through this site &quot;<a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/">http://www.open-mpi.org/</a>&quot;,here only mentioned how to run MPI applications but we need our new stack has to be checked using MPI.<br>
<br>As we checked our new stack using qperf tool but MPI is more recommended .Want to know how to run MPI as how we used qperf. we used qperf like &quot;at one node running qperf as server and running qperf at other node as client,ran all the qperf test cases from client to see the functionality and performance of OFED&quot;.Like this how we can use OPEN-MPI tool to test the new stack.<br>
<br>I think problem conveyed well,please get back to me on this as soon as possible.<br><br>Thanks &amp; regards,<br>Punya Bhimesh.<br>
