    You're gonna have to use a protocol that can route through a
    machine, OFED User Verbs (ie openib) does not do this.&nbsp; The only way
    I know of to do this via OMPI is with the tcp btl.<br>

      When we try to run our OpenMPI program we are receiving:
      <br>
      At least one pair of MPI processes are unable to reach each other

      <br>
      MPI communications.&nbsp; This means that no Open MPI device has

      that it can be used to communicate between these processes.&nbsp; This
      is
      <br>
      an error; Open MPI requires that all MPI processes be able to

      <br>
      each other.&nbsp; This error can sometimes be the result of forgetting
      to

      Your MPI job is now going to abort; sorry.

      I hope I'm not being overly naive but, is their a way to join the
      subnets at the MPI layer?&nbsp; It seems like IP over IB would be too
      high up the stack.
