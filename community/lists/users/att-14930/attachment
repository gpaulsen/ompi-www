I believe the user specifically wishes to use the special debugging 
tools in Solaris Studio. The flag in question seems to be -rpath 
according to the logs,  It would be suspicious if this was a flag for 
the Solaris linker. I don&#39;t have access to any solaris machines but I 
may try make a virtual install to investigate.<br><br>&lt;in reply to&gt; <br><br>Hi Nehemiah<br>
<br>
Hard to tell, I never tried Sun/Oracle Studio compilers.<br>
However, the Intel compilers, for instance, require you to setup<br>
environment variables that include PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH at least.<br>
Would this be the case with Sun Studio?<br>
Do you have its full environment set?<br>
<br>
As for the error message,<br>
indeed, &quot;man ld&quot; doesn&#39;t show &quot;-path&quot; as a possible option.<br>
Would this be a &quot;Solaris thing&quot;, perhaps an option<br>
to the Solaris linker?<br>
<br>
For what it is worth, OpenMPI compiles with gcc,g++ and gfortran,<br>
which may be a workaround for you, if you want to stick to free compilers.<br>
Likewise, it also compiles with Open64 compilers, although later<br>
on I had trouble with the Open64 Fortran compiler (not to compile OpenMPI, but MPI applications).<br>
Do you have any specific requirement for Sun/Oracle software?<br>
<br>
OpenMPI also compiles with Intel and PGI compilers,<br>
but those aren&#39;t free.<br>
<br>
Finally, make sure you are passing the Sun compilers to the OpenMPI<br>
configure script correctly.<br>
Somehow your warning messages are labeled &quot;f90&quot;, not &quot;sunf90&quot; as I<br>
would expect, but this may be just the way Sun decided to spell their<br>
own error messages.<br>
<br>
If you are in Rocks, better install the compilers in /share/apps,<br>
not in /opt as it is now.<br>
That will make the Sun compilers and their possible shared libraries available to all nodes.<br>
/share/apps is the right place to install mostly anything that doesn&#39;t<br>
come in the Rocks/CentOS distribution.<br>
<br>
Good luck,<br>
