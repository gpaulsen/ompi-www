<br>
Allow me to interject.<br>
Are you saying that you run master on your local machine and launching openMPI process on EC2? &nbsp;You are saying that 1) tcp port tcp://192.168.1.101:35272 is on your local system and 2) the ec2 instance is trying to connect your local machine’s port 35272 , and hanging. &nbsp;Is that correct?<br>
<br>
I have just a bit different situation. &nbsp;I am running 2 ec2 instances and trying to run mpirun on both instances. &nbsp;My ssh debug output looks quite similar to yours and mpirun behavior also very similar. &nbsp;Here’s what I captured:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sending command: &nbsp;orted --daemonize -mca ess env -mca orte_ess_jobid 1025769472 -mca orte_ess_vpid 1 -mca orte_ess_num_procs 2 --hnp-uri &quot;1025769472.0;tcp://10.118.23.4:60941&quot;<br>
And here’s what I did on the instance from which I issued mpirun:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;[tsakai@ip-10-118-23-4 ~]$ nslookup `hostname`<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Server: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;172.16.0.23<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Address: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;172.16.0.23#53<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-authoritative answer:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Name: &nbsp;&nbsp;ip-10-118-23-4.ec2.internal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Address: 10.118.23.4<br>
<br>
So that tcp port does belong to this instance. &nbsp;Furthermore, it cannot come into it. &nbsp;No router (which may perform address translation?) is involved and it appears the same thing as what you describe is happening. &nbsp;Incidentally, here’s how I ran mpirun:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;[tsakai@ip-10-118-23-4 ~]$ mpirun -app app.ac<br>
With app.ac file:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;[tsakai@ip-10-118-23-4 ~]$ cat app.ac<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;-H ip-10-118-23-4.ec2.internal -np 1 /bin/hostname<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;-H ip-10-118-23-4.ec2.internal -np 1 /bin/hostname<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;-H ip-10-118-18-172.ec2.internal -np 1 /bin/hostname<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;-H ip-10-118-18-172.ec2.internal -np 1 /bin/hostname<br>
<br>
The first two lines spawns /bin/hostname on this instance (ip-10-118-23-4.ec2.internal) and the bottom 2 lines on the remote instance.<br>
Here’s the security group used for these instances:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;connetion &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;protocol &nbsp;&nbsp;from &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;source<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;------------- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;----------- &nbsp;&nbsp;------ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;----- &nbsp;&nbsp;------------<br>

&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;Here's the problem:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;I've installed opmpi (1.4.3) on a remote system (an Amazon ec2 instance). &nbsp;If the local system I'm working on has a static ip address (and a direct connection to the internet), there's no problem. &nbsp;But if the local system accesses the internet through a router (which itself gets it's ip via dhcp), a call to runmpi command hangs.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;This is not firewall problem - I've disabled the firewalls on all the system that are involved (and the router).<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;It is also not an ssh problem. &nbsp;The ssh connection is being made and it appears that the application has been launched on the remote system. &nbsp;After the runmpi command has been launched locally, a ps on the remote system shows a process<br>
&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;<br>
</span></font></blockquote><font face="Calibri, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><span style="font-size:11pt"> <br>
&nbsp;While I don't really understand the orted process, I assume this indicates that a command to execute an app has been received and that opmpi is trying to run it.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;I suspect that the problem is related to the '--hnp-uri ... tcp://192.168.1.101' argument. &nbsp;192.168.1.101 is the address of my local system on my local network (attached to the router), which of course is not accessible over the net. &nbsp;It appears that opmpi is transmitting the local (static) ip address to the remote host.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;It would help to know how opmpi determines and distributes IP addresses. &nbsp;And if there's any way to control this.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;Any thoughts on dealing with this would be greatly appreciated.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;Thanks,<br>
