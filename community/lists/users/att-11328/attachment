Hello list,<br><br>a while back in January of this year, a user (Anthony Thevenin) had the problem of running out of open pipes when he tried to use MPI_Comm_spawn a few times. As I the thread his started in the mailing list archives and have just joined the mailing list myself, I unfortunately can&#39;t reply to the thread. &quot;The thread was titled: Doing a lot of spawns does not work with ompi 1.3 BUT works with ompi 1.2.7&quot;.<br>

<br>The discussion stopped without really presenting a solution. Is the issue brought up by Anthony fixed? We are running into the same problem.<br><br>Thanks, nick<br><br>
