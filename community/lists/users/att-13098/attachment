 type="cite">Hello,<br>
  <br>
I assume this question has been already discussed many times, but I can
not find on Internet a solution to my problem.<br>
It is about buffer size limit of MPI_Send and MPI_Recv with
heterogeneous system (32 bit laptop / 64 bit cluster). <br>
My configuration is :<br>
open mpi 1.4, configured with: --without-openib --enable-heterogeneous
--enable-mpi-threads<br>
Program is launched a laptop (32 bit Mandriva 2008) which distributes
tasks to do to a cluster of 70 processors&nbsp; (64 bit RedHat Entreprise
distribution):<br>
I have to send various buffer size from few bytes till 30Mo.<br>
  <br>

You really want to get your program running without the tcp_eager_limit
set if you want a better usage of memory.&nbsp; I believe the crash has
something to do with the rendezvous protocol in OMPI.&nbsp; Have you
narrowed this failure down to a simple MPI program?&nbsp; Also I noticed
that you're configuring with --enable-mpi-threads, have you tried
configuring without that option?<br>

2) mpirun --mca btl_tcp_eager_limit 30000000 -v -machinefile
machinefile.txt MyMPIProgram <br>
-&gt; works but has the effect of generating gigantic memory
consumption on 32 bit machine side after MPI_Recv. Memory consumption
goes from 800Mo to 2,1Go after receiving about 20ko from each 70
clients ( a total of about 1.4 Mo ).&nbsp; This makes my program crash later
because I have no more memory to allocate new structures. I read in a
openmpi forum thread that setting btl_tcp_eager_limit to a huge value
explains this huge memory consumption when a message sent does not have
a preposted ready recv. Also after all messages have been received and
there is no more traffic activity : the memory consumed remains at
2.1go... and I do not understand why.<br>

Are the 70 clients all on different nodes?&nbsp; I am curious if the 2.1GB
is due to the SM BTL or possibly a leak in the TCP BTL.<br>

What is the best way to do in order to have a working program which
also has a small memory consumption (the speed performance can be
lower) ?<br>
I tried to play with mca paramters btl_tcp_sndbuf and mca
btl_tcp_rcvbuf, but without success.<br>
  <br>
Thanks in advance for you help.<br>
