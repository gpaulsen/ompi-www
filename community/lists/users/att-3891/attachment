<span class="gmail_quote"></span>Hello, <br>I&#39;m Hiep, I&#39;m trying to use checkpoint/restart feature in Open MPI. I had read information about this feature in&nbsp; <a href="https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/wiki/ProcessFT_CR" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">
<a>https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac</a>/ompi/wiki/ProcessFT_CR
</a> and Open-MPI-FT-CR-Draft-v1.pdf. I had built Open MPI from &quot;trunk&quot; which gotten by Subversion.<br>But I don&#39;t know how to enable checkpoint/restart fault tolerance in Open MPI.<br>So that, I get this error when I try this command: ompi-checkpoint.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bash: ompi-checkpoint: command not found<br>I want to ask you how to build and use checkpoint/restart feature in Open MPI.<br>Please tell me in details, I&#39;m a new user.<br>Thanks!<br>
