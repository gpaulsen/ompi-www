<div dir="ltr">Hello,<div><br></div><div>I have a n-variable function optimization task that I programmed with a scatter, each mpi process evaluates my function in part of the space, then a reduce to get the maximum at the root process. Most wall time is spent in the function evaluations done inside every mpi process. </div>
<div><br></div><div>I would like to report to the root process some progress indicator, ie 40% done so far and so on...<br></div><div><br></div><div>What is the customary solution?</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks</div><div>
