Thanks all for the answers,<br>
<br>
I am parallelizing tomography algorithm which takes about 5 hours using
single processor.<br>
I want to gain full performance and&nbsp; should reduce&nbsp; the computational
time as short as possible.<br>
I was wondering the SSh/RSH launcher could&nbsp; be&nbsp; a&nbsp; performance&nbsp;
issue?(I am just guessing)<br>
What&nbsp; kind of software/middleware I should use to solve the
network/communication overhead.<br>
(different launchers ,may be <a name="pls-available">Sun Grid
Engine,XGrid ? ) I am runing Debian/Lenny and since the project is
academic&nbsp; I want to use OSS&nbsp; ..<br>
<br>
Best Regards,<br>
Umanga <br>

Ans. May be you are right. I don't know exactly how peers communicate
in MPI environment, but I can say for sure that OpenMPI uses rsh/ssh as
one of the available launchers.

Open MPI uses two different mechanisms for launching individual MPI
processes vs. MPI communications.&nbsp; rsh/ssh is one of the options that
Open MPI can use for launching MPI processes, but we don't keep those
channels open and don't use them for MPI communications.&nbsp; Individual,
new TCP sockets are opened for MPI_SEND / MPI_RECV (etc.) traffic.&nbsp;
These sockets are not encrypted (like ssh connections would be).

copy of the application right?
    <br>
Ans. Absolutely correct. But If you don't want to copy binaries
manually you should use "--preload-binary" option. OpenMPI will copy
the executables in remote nodes before launching processes, and will
delete when job gets done.
    <br>
    <br>
It is almost always good to use latest version. "--preload-binary"
option may be absent in old versions.

It is new in the 1.3 series; it did not exist in the 1.2 series.
