Hi guys,<br><br>am new to cluster computing, so please bear with me.<br>currently trying to utilize the available desktops found in labs.<br><br>Started trying out 2 labs, (namely Lab A which have 192.168.0.xx IPs <br>and Lab B which have public IPs 202.185.77.xx series)<br>
<br>Have been running Paraview in Lab A without any problem so far.<br>(mpirun -np 18 -machinefile quad_lan pvserver)<br><br>As i tried to extend the cluster to Lab B&#39;s desktops, by specifying their IPs in <br>my machinefile like: <br>
<br>202.185.77.110 slots=4 max-slots=4 <b>#(eth1 = 202.185.77.110; eth0 = 192.168.0.10)</b><br>202.185.77.219 slots=2 max-slots=2        <b>&lt;-- this is &quot;pc226</b>&quot;<br>192.168.0.227 slots=2 max-slots=2<br><br>
my programs hangs while my client tries to connect to the pvserver.<br>if i wait long  enough, it will show the error <br><br>yewyong@vrc1:~/installer/mpi_test&gt; mpirun -np 8 -machinefile quad_hama pvserver --use-offscreen-rendering<br>
Listen on port: 11111<br>Waiting for client...<br>Client connected.<br>[pc226][[8636,1],6][btl_tcp_endpoint.c:631:mca_btl_tcp_endpoint_complete_connect] connect() failed: Connection timed out (110)<br><br>note that when running &quot;hello_world&quot;, it shows that the makeshift cluster are able to communicate which each other. <br>
after trying out different sequence in the machinefile, i found out that whenever a cross IPs mpirun server is started, the system pauses<br>when the client tries to connect.<br><br>Would it be related to the problem raised in &quot;<a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/devel/2009/07/6385.php">http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/devel/2009/07/6385.php</a>&quot;? <br>
<br>i&#39;m not too sure if i&#39;ve fully described the situation, please let me know if you guys need any extra information.<br><br>thank you in advance.<br><br>yewyong.<br>
