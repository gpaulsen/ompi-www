<div>Sorry, I should say one more thing about the 500 procs test. I tried to run two 500 procs at the same time using SGE and it runs fast and finishes at the same time as the single run. So I think OpenMPI can handle them separately very well. </div>
<div><br></div><div>For the bind-to-core, I tried to run mpirun --help but not find the bind-to-core info. I only see bynode or byslot options. Is it same as bind-to-core? My mpirun shows version 1.3.3 but ompi_info shows 1.4.2.<br>

Here is what I meant: the results of 500 procs in fact shows it with 272-304(&lt;500) real cores, the program&#39;s running time is good, which is almost five times 100 procs&#39; time. So it can be handled very well. Therefore I guess OpenMPI or Rocks OS does make use of hyperthreading to do the job. But with 600 procs, the running time is more than double of that of 500 procs. I don&#39;t know why. This is my problem.  <br>

BTW, how to use -bind-to-core? I added it as mpirun&#39;s options. It always gives me error &quot; the executable &#39;bind-to-core&#39; can&#39;t be found. Isn&#39;t it like:<br>
mpirun --mca btl_tcp_if_include eth0 -np 600  -bind-to-core scatttest<br>

Thanks for sending the mpirun run and error message.  That helps.<br>
<br>
It&#39;s not recognizing the --bind-to-core option.  (Single hyphen, as you had, should also be okay.)  Skimming through the e-mail, it looks like you are using OMPI 1.3.2 and 1.4.2.  Did you try --bind-to-core with both?  If I remember my version numbers, --bind-to-core will not be recognized with 1.3.2, but should be with 1.4.2.  Could it be that you only tried 1.3.2?<br>

<br>
Another option is to try &quot;mpirun --help&quot;.  Make sure that it reports --bind-to-core.<div><div></div><div class="h5"><br>
