&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please send me your /etc/make.conf and the contents of
/var/db/pkg/sys-cluster/openmpi-1.2.7/<br>

You can package this with the following command line:<br>

  <pre wrap="">Hi,

 I did make sure at the beginning that only eth0 was activated on all the
nodes. Nevertheless, I am currently verifying the NIC configuration on all
the nodes and making sure things are as expected.

While trying different things, I did come across this peculiar error which I
had detailed in one of my previous mails in this thread.

I am testing the helloWorld program in the following trivial case:

mpirun -np 1 -host localhost /main/mpiHelloWorld

Which works fine.

But,

mpirun -np 1 -host localhost --debug-daemons /main/mpiHelloWorld

always fails as follows:

Daemon [0,0,1] checking in as pid 2059 on host localhost
[idx1:02059] [0,0,1] orted: received launch callback

[idx1:02059] *** End of error message ***

The failure happens with more verbose output when using the -d flag.

Does this point to some bug in OpenMPI or am I missing something here?

I have attached ompi_info output on this node.

Regards,

Prasanna.
