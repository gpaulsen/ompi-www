<div>Hi All,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Just wondering if anyone can point me to the detailed information on how to setup multiple nodes and network them together to use OpenMPI. Also what is the proper way to specify which nodes to run on. I wish to use OpenMPI on the Windows XP or Windows
Server 2008 platform, with Intel Fortran 11 as the programming language.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have searched Google and also looked through the OpenMPI website but there does not seem to be any comprehensive documents to run OpenMPI on Windows, especially setting up the nodes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Many years ago, I played a bit with Mpich and LAM MPI on a purely Linux platform. On Linux clusters, it is easy &#8211; the head node see each of the compute nodes. As I remember, the programmer need to only write the names of the compute nodes in some sort
of config file. The job is submitted and based on the compute nodes listed, the mpi will run on them.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>On Windows, what kind of networking is needed to tie the nodes together? (assuming we are not using any of the MS HPC Pack or Compute Cluster). How do we specify which nodes to use? How do we specify any security or group permissions for the nodes?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Would be great if someone got some documentation for this.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thanks</div>
<div>Clinton</div>
