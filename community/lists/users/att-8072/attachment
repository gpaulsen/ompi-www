Hi,<br><br>When I use MPI_File_write_ordered to overwrite an existing file, the new file is not truncated to the appropriate size.<br>For example, if I first create a new file and write &quot;aa&quot; from two nodes, the file contains &quot;aaaa&quot;. <br>
Then I close the file, and compute for a while.<br>Later, I reopen the file with amode=CREATE | WRONLY and write &quot;b&quot; from two nodes, the file contains &quot;bbaa&quot;.<br>I would have expected the file to contain only &quot;bb&quot;.<br>
<br>Am I misunderstanding something, or is this a bug?<br>Now that I think about it, this seems more like a problem with MPI_File_Open: <br>this is the behavior I would have expected if I had reopened the file with amode=CREATE | RDRW.<br>
Shouldn&#39;t MPI_File_Open truncate the file to 0 when it is opened WRONLY and not APPEND?<br><br>I&#39;m able to obtain my desired result by calling <br>

MPI_File_get_position_shared()<br>

MPI_File_set_size()<br>
<br>Thanks<br>-Brian<br><br>PS. I&#39;m using (Open MPI) 1.1.2<br>
