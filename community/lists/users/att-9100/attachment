It&#39;s hard for me to believe that would work as there are fundamental differences in the MPI-to-RTE interactions between those releases. If it does, it could be a fluke - I personally would not trust it.<br><br>Ralph<br>

Hi Jeff,<br>
<br>
&gt; That being said, we have fixed this issue and expect to support binary<br>
&gt; compatibility between Open MPI releases starting with v1.3.2 (v1.3.1<br>
<br>
As far as I can tell from reading the release notes for v1.3.2, the binary compatibility has not been announced yet. It was rather a bug fix release. Is it correct? Does it mean that the compatibility feature is pushed to later releases, v1.3.3, 1.3.4?<br>

<br>
In my original message (see below) I was looking for advice as for a seamless transition from v1.2.x to v1.3.x in a shared multi-user environment.<br>
<br>
Interestingly enough, recently I noticed that although it&#39;s impossible to run an application compiled with v1.2.x under v1.3.x, the opposite does actually work. An application compiled with v1.3.x runs using Open MPI v1.2.x. Specifically, I tested an application compiled with v1.3.0 and v1.3.2, running under Open MPI v1.2.7.<br>

<br>
This gives me a perfect opportunity to recompile all the parallel applications with v1.3.x, transparently to users; and then switch the default Open MPI library from v1.2.7 to v1.3.x, when all the apps have been rebuilt.<br>

<br>
The problem is that I am not 100% sure in this approach, even having some successful tests done.<br>
<br>
Is it safe to run an application built with 1.3.x under 1.2.x? Does it make sense to you?<br>
<br>

Unfortunately, binary compatibility between Open MPI release versions has never been guaranteed (even between subreleases).<br>
<br>
That being said, we have fixed this issue and expect to support binary compatibility between Open MPI releases starting with v1.3.2 (v1.3.1 should be released soon; we&#39;re aiming for v1.3.2 towards the beginning of next month).<br>

Hello,<br>
<br>
We have a number of applications built with Open MPI 1.2 in a shared<br>
multi-user environment. The Open MPI library upgrade has been always<br>
transparent and painless within the v1.2 branch. Now we would like to<br>
switch to Open MPI 1.3 as seamlessly. However, an application built with<br>
ompi v1.2 will not run with the 1.3 library; the typical error messages<br>
are given below. Apparently, the type ompi_communicator_t has changed.<br>
<br>
Symbol `ompi_mpi_comm_null&#39; has different size in shared object,<br>
consider re-linking<br>
Symbol `ompi_mpi_comm_world&#39; has different size in shared object,<br>
consider re-linking<br>
<br>
Do I have to rebuild all the applications with Open MPI 1.3?<br>
<br>
Is there a better way to do a smooth upgrade?<br>
<br>
Thank you.<br>
<br>
