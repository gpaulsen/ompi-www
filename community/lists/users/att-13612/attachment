You don&#39;t need to check anything alse in the red window, OpenMPI
doesn&#39;t know it&#39;s in a virtual machine.  If you&#39;re running Windows in a
virtual cluster, are you running as 32-bit or 64-bit?  <br><font color="#888888">

  <div>Either way, thanks a lot guys, you&#39;ve been of great help to me.
I really want to do my project well, as not many almost-18 year olds
get to work with clusters and I&#39;d like to take full advantage of the
experience<br>

That red window is what you should see after the first Configure step
in CMake.  You need to do the next few steps in CMake and Visual Studio
to get a Windows OpenMPI build done.  That&#39;s how CMake works.  It&#39;s
complicated because CMake has to be able to build on multiple OSes so
what you do on each OS is different.  Here&#39;s what to do:<br>
    <br>
As part of your original CMake setup, it will have asked you where to
put the CMake binaries.  That&#39;s in &quot;Where to build the binaries&quot; line
in the main CMake window, at the top.  Note that these binaries aren&#39;t
the OpenMPI binaries, they&#39;re the Visual Studio project files that
Visual Studio uses to build the OpenMPI binaries.<br>
    <br>
See the CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE line?  It says Debug.  Change Debug to Release
if you want a Release build (you probably do).  Press the Configure
button again and let it run.  That should be all clean.  Now press the
Generate button.  That will build the Visual Studio project files for
you.  They&#39;ll go to the &quot;Where to build the binaries&quot; directory.  From
here you&#39;re done with CMake.<br>
    <br>
Next you have two options.  You can build from a command line, or from
within Visual Studio itself.  For command-line instructions, read this:<br>
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/users/2010/02/12013.php" target="_blank">https://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/users/2010/02/12013.php</a><br>
    <br>
Note that you need to execute the devenv commands in that post from
within a Visual Studio command prompt: Start, All Programs, Visual
Studio 2008, Visual Studio Tools, Visual Studio 2008 Win64 x64 Command
Prompt.  I&#39;m assuming you want a 64-bit build.  You need to be in that
&quot;Where to build the binaries&quot; directory as well.<br>
    <br>
To use Visual Studio directly, start Visual Studio, and open the
OpenMPI.sln project file that&#39;s in your &quot;Where to build the binaries&quot;
directory.  In the Solution Explorer you&#39;ll see a list of sub-projects.
 Right-click the top heading: Solution &#39;Open MPI&#39; and select
Configuration Manager.  You should get a window that says at the top
Active Solution Configuration, with Release below it.  If it says
Debug, just change that to Release and it will flip all the
sub-projects over as well.  Note on the the list of projects the
INSTALL project will not be checked.  Check that now and close the
window.   Now right-click Solution &#39;Open MPI&#39; again and hit Build
Solution.  It takes a while to compile everything.  If you get errors
about error code -31 and mt.exe at the end of the build, that&#39;s your
virus scanner locking the new exe/dll files and the install project
complains.  Keep right-clicking and Build Solution until it goes
through.  The final Open MPI include files and binaries are in the
C:\Users\Alex&#39;s\Downloads......\installed directory.<br>

PS OpenMPI 1.4.2 doesn&#39;t have Fortran support on Windows.  You need the
dev 1.5 series for that and a Fortran compiler.

Hey,<br>
      <br>
I installed a 90 day trial of Visual Studio 2008, and I am pretty sure
I am getting the exact same thing. The log and the picture are attached
just as last time. Any new ideas?<br>
      <br>
