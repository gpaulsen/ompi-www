With one average generic (power/cooling mostly) failure every one or two months, running for weeks is just asking for trouble. If you add to that typical dimm/cpu/networking failures (I estimated about 1 node goes down per day because of some sort hardware failure, for a cluster of 960 nodes). With these numbers, a job running on 32 nodes for 7 days has a ~35% chance of failing before it is done.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; "></blockquote></div><br><div>I've been running this in my head all day - it just doesn't fit experience, which really bothered me. So I spent a little time running the calculation, and I came up with a number much lower (more like around 5%).

My expectation is that you might see 0-2 failures over 32 runs (4 running in parallel each week) during that entire period, and learn that FT really isn't an issue for your installation.</div><div><br></div><div>If it turns out you see power failure problems, then a simple, low-cost, ride-thru power stabilizer might be a good solution. Flywheels and capacitor-based systems can provide support for momentary power quality issues at reasonably low costs for a cluster of your size.</div><div><br></div><div>If your node hardware is the problem, or you decide you do want/need to pursue an FT solution, then you might look at the OMPI-based solutions from parties such as <a href="http://fault-tolerance.org">http://fault-tolerance.org</a> or the MPICH2 folks.</div><div><br></div><div>HTH</div><div>Ralph</div><div><br></div></body></html>
