Hi all,<br><br>I got this message when I issued this command:<br><br>root@node1:/home/abolap# ompi_info | grep crs<br>                 MCA crs: none (MCA v2.0, API v2.0, Component v1.6.3)<br><br>The installation looks okay and I have reinstalled but still got the same issue.<br>
<br>When I searched for the solution I found out that this is a bug which Josh has filed (<a href="https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/ticket/2097">https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/ticket/2097</a>) but I cannot see the solution or workaround.<br>
<br>This is the initial post - <a href="http://www.digipedia.pl/usenet/thread/11269/6087/#post6031">http://www.digipedia.pl/usenet/thread/11269/6087/#post6031</a><br><br>Please assist.<br><br>Regards,<br>Ifeanyi<br>
