Hello,
<br>
<p>Say I don't have access to a actual cluster, yet I'm considering cloud
<br>
compute solutions for my MPI program ultimately, but such a cost may be
<br>
highly prohibitive at the moment.
<br>
In terms of middle ground, if I am interesting in compute only, no storage,
<br>
what are possible hardware solutions out there to deploy my MPI program?
<br>
By no storage, I mean that my control linux box running the frontend of the
<br>
program, but is also part of the mpi communicator always gathers all
<br>
results and stores them locally.
<br>
At the moment, I have a second box over ethernet.
<br>
<p>I am looking at something like Intel Compute Stick (is it possible at all
<br>
to buy a few, is linux running on them, the arch seems to be the same
<br>
x86-64, is there a possible setup with tcp for those and have openmpi over
<br>
tcp)?
<br>
<p>Is it more cost-effective to look at extra regular linux commodity boxes?
<br>
If a no hard drive box is possible, can the executables of my MPI program
<br>
sendable over the wire before running them?
<br>
<p>If we exclude GPU or other nonMPI solutions, and cost being a primary
<br>
factor, what is progression path from 2boxes to a cloud based solution
<br>
(amazon and the like...)
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
MM
