Hello all
<br>
<p>I have a question, that I do realize, is somewhat off topic to this list.
<br>
But I do not know who to approach for an answer. Hopefully the community
<br>
here will help me out.
<br>
<p>I know that Infiniband is a 'standard' interface (standardized by IETF?
<br>
IEEE? or some similar body), much like Ethernet.
<br>
<p>However, I do see that they come in different 'flavors', (and have
<br>
different feature set?) such as Qlogic PSM or Mellanox ConnectX, that have
<br>
*user space* &quot;drivers&quot; and even OpenMPI treats them differently (preferring
<br>
Qlogic PSM over other IB, as a default behavior).
<br>
<p>For someone very new to the Infiniband world, what are the differences? How
<br>
can they be different and yet confirm to the (supposed) standard?
<br>
<p>Any pointer to appropriate literature is appreciated.
<br>
<p>Thanks in advance
<br>
Durga
