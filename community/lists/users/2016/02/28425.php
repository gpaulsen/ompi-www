***************************************************************************************
* ALCHEMY Workshop 2016

***************************************************************************************


   The 4th workshop on Architecture, Languages, Compilation and Hardware
support for Emerging ManYcore systems (ALCHEMY) is a unique encountering
place between all domains of science around many-core system
programming. Especially this is a place where traditional HPC scientists
can encounter embedded-HPC scientists and vice-versa, to talk about
issues and new solutions for programming many-cores.

This is a good place to discuss about emerging targets (new many-core
processors) or emerging solutions to program them or making the
execution more efficient (through software or hardware features).

Submission Deadline : February 8
Up to 10 pages Procedia CS format, or 2 pages for WiP and posters.
Through Easychair: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iccs20160">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iccs20160</a>
(select the ALCHEMY track)


Full Call for Paper:

Massively parallel processors have entered high performance computing
architectures, as well as embedded systems. In this
context, developers of parallel applications, including heavy
simulations and scientific calculations will undoubtedly have to cope
with many-core processors at the early design steps.

In the past sessions of the Alchemy workshop, held together with
the ICCS meeting, we have presented significant contributions on the
design of many-core processors, both in the hardware and the software
programming environment sides, as well as some industrial-grade
application case studies. In this 2016 session, we seek academic
and industrial works that contribute to the design and the
programmability of many-core processors.


Topics
     Topics include, but are not limited to:
     * Programming models and languages for many-cores
     * Compilers for programming languages
     * Runtime generation for parallel programming on manycores
     * Architecture support for massive parallelism management
     * Enhanced communications for CMP/manycores
     * Shared memory, data consistency models and protocols
     * New operating systems, or dedicated OS
     * Security, crypto systems for manycores
     * User feedback on existing manycore architectures
       (experiments with Adapteva Epiphany, Intel Phi, Kalray MPPA, ST
     STHorm, Tilera Gx, TSAR..etc)
     * Many-core integration within HPC systems (micro-servers)

Submission:

  This year, there will be two formats for the presentation at the
workshop. The usual full-length paper is 10 pages according to the ICCS
format, and the short-paper format well fitted for works in progress,
with a maximum of 2 pages. The accepted papers for full-length paper
will be published alongside with the ICCS proceedings in Procedia
Computer Science, whereas the short-papers will be presentation and
poster only at the conference (with proceedings and presentations
available from the workshop website).

The manuscripts of up to 10 pages, written in English and formatted
according to the EasyChair templates, should be submitted electronically.
