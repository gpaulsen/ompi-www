<font face="arial">Hi,<br><br>I am trying to build Open MPI 1.4.3 with thread support on Windows. A trivial test program <br>runs if it calls MPI_Init or MP_Init_thread</font>(int *argc, char ***argv, int required, int *provide) with<br>reguired=0 but hangs if required&gt;0. ompi_info for my build reports that there is no thread<br>support but MPI_Init_thread returns provide==required. <br><br>The only change in the CMake configuration was to check OMPI_ENABLE_MPI_THREADS. <br>Is there anything else that needs to be done with the configuration? <br><br>I have built 1.4.3 with thread support on several linuxes and mac and it works fine there. <br><br>Regards,<br>Bjorn Regnstrom<br>
