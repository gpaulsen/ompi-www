<div dir="ltr"><div><div><div><div>Hello OpenMPI,<br><br>I was wondering what is the support that is being implemented for the Intel Phi platforms. That is would we be able to run MPI code in &quot;symmetric&quot; fashion, where some ranks run on the cores of the multicore hostst and some on the cores of the Phis in a multinode cluster environment.<br>
<br></div>Also is it based on OFED 1.5.4.1 or on which OFED?  <br><br></div>Best regards<br></div>Michael<br></div><br></div>
