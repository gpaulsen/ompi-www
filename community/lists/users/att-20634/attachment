Hi, <br>   Have anyone know about MPI Program use to measure communication round-trip time on Cluster ( like ping command on network) <br>   That is the program have each process run on each node on Cluster. Then it use MPI to calculate the communication round-trip time among nodes. <br>
    Thanks<br>
