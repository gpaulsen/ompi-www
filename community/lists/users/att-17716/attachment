<font size=2 face="sans-serif">I'm attempting to launch my app via mpirun
and a host file to use nodes on multiple 'stand-alone' servers. &nbsp;mpirun
is able to launch my app on all requested nodes on all servers, but my
app doesn't seem to be able to communicate via the standard MPI api calls
(send , recv, etc). &nbsp;The problem seems to be that my sysadmin dept
has locked down most/all ports for simple socket connections. &nbsp;They
are asking me which specific ports (or range of ports) are required by
mpi. &nbsp;I'm assuming that mpirun used secure sockets to launch my app
on all nodes but that my app is not using secure sockets via the MPI calls.
&nbsp;Does any of this make sense? &nbsp;I'm using version 1.4.0 I think.</font>
