As has been discussed on this list before, OMPI made a design decision to minimize latency. This means we aggressively poll for connections. Only thing you can do is tell it to yield the processor when idle so, if something else is trying to run, we will let it get in there a little earlier. Use -mca mpi_yield_when_idle 1<div><br></div><div>However, we have seen that if no other user processes are trying to run, then the scheduler hands the processor right back to you - and you'll still see that 100% number. It doesn't mean we are being hogs - it just means that nothing else wants to run, so we happily accept the time.</div><div><br></div><div><br><div><div>On Oct 14, 2011, at 12:21 PM, Thatyene Louise Alves de Souza Ramos wrote:</div><br class="Apple-interchange-newline"><blockquote type="cite">Does anyone have any idea?<div><br></div><div>---</div><div>Thatyene Ramos<br><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Fri, Oct 7, 2011 at 12:01 PM, Thatyene Louise Alves de Souza Ramos <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:thatyene@gmail.com">thatyene@gmail.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br>
