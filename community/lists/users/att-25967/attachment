      can you try something like<br>
      call system(sh -c 'env -i /.../mpirun -np 2 /.../app_name')<br>
      <br>
      -i start with an empty environment<br>
      that being said, you might need to set a few environment variables
      manually :<br>
      env -i PATH=/bin ...<br>
      <br>
      and that being also said, this "trick" could be just a bad idea :<br>
      you might be using a scheduler, and if you empty the environment,
      the scheduler<br>
      will not be aware of the "inside" run.<br>
      <br>
      on top of that, invoking system might fail depending on the
      interconnect you use.<br>
      <br>
      Bottom line, i believe Ralph's reply is still valid, even if five
      years have passed :<br>
      changing your workflow, or using MPI_Comm_spawn is a much better
      approach.<br>
      <br>

      <pre wrap="">Dear OpenMPI users,

Regarding to this previous post
<a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/users/2009/06/9560.php">&lt;http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/users/2009/06/9560.php&gt;</a> from 2009,
I wonder if the reply
from Ralph Castain is still valid. My need is similar but quite simpler:
to make a system call from an openmpi fortran application to run a
third party openmpi application. I don't need to exchange mpi messages
with the application. I just need to read the resulting output file
generated
by it. I have tried to do the following system call from my fortran openmpi
code:

call system("sh -c 'mpirun -n 2 app_name")

but I get

**********************************************************

Open MPI does not support recursive calls of mpirun

**********************************************************

Is there a way to make this work?

Best regards,

Alex
