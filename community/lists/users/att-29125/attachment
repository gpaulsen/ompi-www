&gt; It&#39;s taking so long because you are sleeping for .1 second between calling MPI_Test().<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The TCP transport is only sending a few fragments of your message during each iteration through MPI_Test (because, by definition, it has to return &quot;immediately&quot;).  Other transports do better handing off large messages like this to hardware for asynchronous progress.<br>
&gt; This agrees with what I observed. Larger messages needs more calls of MPI_Test. What do you mean by other transports?<br>
<br>
</span>The POSIX sockets API, commonly used with TCP over Ethernet, is great for most network-based applications, but it has some inherent constraints that limit its performance in HPC types of applications.<br>
<br>
That being said, many people just take a bunch of servers and run MPI over over TCP/Ethernet, and it works well enough for them.  Because of this &quot;good enough&quot; performance, and the fact that every server in the world supports some type of Ethernet capability, all MPI implementations support TCP.<br>
<br>
But there are more demanding HPC applications that require higher performance from the network in order to get good overall performance.  As such, other networking APIs -- most commonly provided by vendors for HPC-class networks (Ethernet or otherwise) -- do not have the same performance constraints as the POSIX sockets API, and are usually preferred by HPC applications.<br>
<br>
There&#39;s usually two kinds of performance improvements that such networking APIs offer (in conjunction with the underlying NIC for the HPC-class network):<br>
<br>
1. Improving software API efficiency (e.g., avoid extra memory copies, bypassing the OS and exposing NIC hardware directly into userspace, etc.)<br>
<br>
2. Exploiting NIC hardware capabilities, usually designed for MPI and/or general high performance (e.g., polling for progress instead of waiting for interrupts, hardware demultiplex of incoming messages directly to target processes, direct data placement at the target, etc.)<br>
<br>
Hence, when I say &quot;other transports&quot;, I&#39;m referring to these HPC-class networks (and associated APIs).<br>

&gt; Additionally, in the upcoming v2.0.0 release is a non-default option to enable an asynchronous progress thread for the TCP transport.  We&#39;re up to v2.0.0rc2; you can give that async TCP support a whirl, if you want.  Pass &quot;--mca btl_tcp_progress_thread 1&quot; on the mpirun command line to enable the TCP progress thread to try it.<br>
&gt; Does this mean there&#39;s an additional thread to transfer data in background?<br>
<br>
</span>Yes.<br>
