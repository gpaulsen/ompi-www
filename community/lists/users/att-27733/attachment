<p dir="ltr">Hello Marcin</p>
<p dir="ltr">What configure options are you using besides with-libfabric? </p>
<p dir="ltr">Could you post your config.log file tp the list?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Looks like you only install fi_ext_usnic.h if you could build the usnic libfab provider.  When you configured libfabric what providers were listed at the end of configure run? Maybe attach config.log from the libfabric build ?</p>
<p dir="ltr">If your cluster has cisco usnics you should probably be using libfabric/cisco openmpi.  If you are using intel omnipath you may want to try the ofi mtl.  Its not selected by default however.</p>

I am trying to compile the 2.x branch with libfabric support, but get this error during configure:<br>
<br>
configure:100708: checking rdma/fi_ext_usnic.h presence<br>
configure:100708: gcc -E -I/cluster/software/VERSIONS/openmpi.gnu.2.x/include -I/usit/abel/u1/marcink/software/ompi-release-2.x/opal/mca/hwloc/hwloc1110/hwloc/include conftest.c<br>
conftest.c:688:31: fatal error: rdma/fi_ext_usnic.h: No such file or directory<br>
[...]<br>
configure:100708: checking for rdma/fi_ext_usnic.h<br>
configure:100708: result: no<br>
configure:101253: checking if MCA component btl:usnic can compile<br>
configure:101255: result: no<br>
<br>
Which is correct - the file is not there. I have downloaded fresh libfabric-1.1.0.tar.bz2 and it does not have this file. Probably OpenMPI needs some updates?<br>
<br>
I am also wondering what is the state of libfabric support in OpenMPI nowadays. I have seen recent (March) presentation about it, so it seems to be an actively developed feature. Is this correct? It seemed from the presentation that there are benefits to this approach, but is it mature enough in OpenMPI, or it will yet take some time?<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
<br>
Marcin<br>
