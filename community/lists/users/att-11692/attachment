Hi, I have created a cluster with openmpi this way.<br><br>1 - Configured SSH with authorized_keys from the server to the nodes.<br>2 - In <strong style="font-weight: normal;">/etc/openmpi-default-hostfile\ I have typed the IP of every nodes and the server.<br>

3 - Afterward I have created a Java application of two threads just to type a text on the console and runned it by<br></strong><div style="margin-left: 80px;"><strong>mpirun -1 </strong>java javaprogram<br>or<br><strong>mpirun -2 </strong>java javaprogram<br>

</div>It is on the ps -aux of the server but the nodes are still stoped.<br><br>How can I know that my mpi is working<br><br>Thanks a lot <br>
