Hi,<br>

<br>

I am running WRF simulations on multiple nodes and am running into
problems where the simulation will randomly slow down.  The model still
works, but slows down tremendously.  I looked at the each node and
found that 1 node will only be using 25% of the CPU, while the others
are using 100%.  Is there a chance that this is related to MPI?  I can
resubmit the same run on a different nodes and sometimes it will work,
and other times it slows down.    <br>

<br>

Is there any commands I can utilize that could point me to what is causing the node only to use 25%?<br>

<br>

<br>

Thanks
