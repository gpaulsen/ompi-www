<div style="line-height:1.7;color:#000000;font-size:14px;font-family:arial">Hi all,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 I am trying to install openmpi and come upone many problems. One is 
about the Fortran 77 compiler in configure stage, I solved it by editing
 .bashrc, changing from $GCCHOME/lib to $GCCHOME/lib64. Of course your 
os should be 64-bits. <br>&nbsp; After configure, when running make all install, the screen display:<br><pre>./scripts/mpi_imrecv_f90.f90.sh /home/greatnet/openmpi-1.7.2/ompi/mpi/fortran/use-mpi-tkr &gt; mpi_imrecv_f90.f90
 ../../../../libtool: line 1128: gfortran: command not found
<br> However, I am sure that gfortran exists and can run in any directory. When I add   "$PATH" after line 1128 in libtool, and then remake, it display "/usr/bin:/bin".  Yes, indeed my gcc is not in /usr/bin ,/bin. How to add gcc to that path or how to solve my problem?<br> Thank you for your help.<br>Regards,<br>Meng</pre>&nbsp;</div><br><br><span title="neteasefooter"><span id="netease_mail_footer"></span></span>
