I came across a writeup of the &quot;SLOAVx&quot; algorithm for alltoallv<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.auburn.edu/~zzl0014/pubs/ccgrid13.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.auburn.edu/~zzl0014/pubs/ccgrid13.pdf</a>&gt;.  It was implemented<br>
in OMPI with apparently good results, but I can&#39;t find any code.<br>
<br>
I wonder if anyone knows the story on that.  Was it not contributed, or<br>
is it actually not worthwhile?  Otherwise, might it be worth investigating?<br>
