Hi!<br>I&#39;m using OpenMPI 1.3 on two nodes connected with Infiniband; i&#39;m using Gentoo Linux x86_64.<br><br>I&#39;ve
noticed that before any application starts there is a variable amount
of time (around 3.5 seconds) in which the terminal just hangs with no
output and then the application starts and works well.<br>
<br>I imagined that there might have been some initialization routine
somewhere in the Infiniband layer or in the software stack, but as i
continued my tests i observed that this &quot;latency&quot; time is not present
in other MPI implementations (like mvapich2) where my application
starts immediately (but performs worse).<br>
<br>Is my MPI configuration/installation broken or is this expected behaviour?<br>thanks a lot!<br>Vittorio
