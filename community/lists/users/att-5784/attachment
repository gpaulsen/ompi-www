Hi<br><br>Could you specify few things -<br><br>(a) The version of PG Compilers being used both for HPMPI &amp; OMPI. Is the compilers same or the version same?<br><br>(b) Could you share the configure command given for OMPI with PG compilers?<br>

<br>(c) Could you compare the threads enable/disable for both cases needed?<br><br>(d) Is ptmalloc2 being enabled/disabled for HPMPI or with IB end, could you analyze the same with OPMPI too?<br><br>(e) Could you mail the log files for both.<br>
