<div dir="ltr"><div><div>Hello OpenMPI,<br><br></div><div>When you stack runs on SandyBridge nodes atached to HCAs ove PCI3 <b>gen 3</b> do you pay any special attention to the memory buffers according to which socket/memory controller  their physical memory belongs to?<br>
</div><br>For instance, if the HCA is attached to the PCIgen3 lanes of Socket 1 do you do anything special when the read/write buffers map to physical memory belonging to Socket 2? Or do you7 avoid using buffers mapping ro memory that belongs (is accessible via) the other socket?<br>
<br></div>Has this situation improved with Ivy-Brige systems or Haswell?<br><div><br></div><div>Cheers<br></div><div>Michael<br></div><div><br><br></div></div>
