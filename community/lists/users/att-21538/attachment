<div dir="ltr"><div><div><div>Hi all,<br><br></div>I encountered an error when running 
openmpi Java applications (it works fine with c/c++ applications). The 
java code compiles successfully, but it crashed at runtime with:<br>


<p style="text-autospace:none"><span style="font-size:9pt;font-family:&quot;Lucida Console&quot;">NO LT_DLADVISE - CANNOT LOAD LIBOMPI</span></p>

<p style="text-autospace:none"><span style="font-size:9pt;font-family:&quot;Lucida Console&quot;">JAVA BINDINGS FAILED TO LOAD REQUIRED LIBRARIES</span></p>

</div>I think it has to do with dynamically loading native libraries. 
Since I have no experiences with JNI, I would like to resort to the 
community to help solve the problem.<br><br></div>This is how exactly I install openmpi (on a EC2 AMI linux instance). I use a nightly snapshot openmpi-1.9r28157.tar.gz<br clear="all">
<div><br>sudo ./configure --enable-mpi-java --prefix=/usr/local<br></div><div>sudo make all install<br><br></div><div>I also set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include &quot;/usr/local/lib&quot; which has &quot;libmpi.so&quot;.<br>
</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks,<br></div>-- <br><div>Chris Zhao  </div><div><br></div>
