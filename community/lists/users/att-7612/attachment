HI, <br><br>I need to transfer data from multiple sources to one destination. <br>The requirement is:<br><br>(1) The sources and destination nodes may work asynchronously.<br>&nbsp;<br>(2) Each source node generates data package in their own paces.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, there may be many packages to send. Whenever, a data package <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is generated , it should be sent to the desination node at once.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, the source node continue to work on generating the next <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; package. <br><br>(3) There is only one destination node , which must receive all data <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; package generated from the source nodes. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the source and destination nodes may work asynchronously,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the destination node should not wait for a specific source node until <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the source node sends out its data. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The destination node should be able to receive data package <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from anyone source node whenever the data package is available in a <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; source node. <br><br>My question is :<br><br>What MPI function should be used to implement the protocol above ? <br><br>If I use MPI_Send/Recv, they are blocking function. The destination<br>node have to wait for one node until its data is available. <br><br>The communication overhead is too high. <br><br>If I use MPI_Bsend, the destination node has to use MPI_Recv to , <br>a Blocking receive for a message .<br><br>This can make the destination node wait for only one source node and <br>actually other source nodes may have data avaiable. <br><br><br>Any help or comment is appreciated !!!<br><br>thanks<br><br>Dec. 28 2008<br><br><br /><hr />It’s the same Hotmail®.
