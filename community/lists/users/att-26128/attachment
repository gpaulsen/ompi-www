<div dir="ltr">Dear all,<div>thanks thank a lot, I am learning a lot.<br></div><div><br></div><div>I have written a simple program that send vectors of integers from a CPU to another.</div><div><br></div><div>The program is written (at least for now) for 4 CPU.</div><div><br></div><div>The program is quite simple:</div><div>Each CPU knows how many data has to send to the other CPUs. This info is than send to the other CPUS. In this way each CPU knows how may data has to receive from other CPUs.</div><div><br></div><div>This part of the program works.</div><div><br></div><div>The problem is in the second part.</div><div><br></div><div>In the second part, each processor sends a vector of integer to the other processor. The size is given and each CPU knows the size of the incoming vector form the first part of the program.</div><div><br></div><div>In this second part the program fails and I do not know why.</div><div><br></div><div>In the attachment you can find the program. Could you please help me. Problably I didn&#39;t understand properly the ISEND and IRECV subroutine.Â </div><div><br></div><div>Thanks again</div><div><br></div><div><br clear="all"><div><div class="gmail_signature">Diego<br><br></div></div>
