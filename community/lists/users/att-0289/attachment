Hi,<br>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font size="2"><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">I
help maintain a Web site at <a href="http://www.clusterbuilder.org/" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">www.clusterbuilder.org</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
You might have seen before that I have a section called Ask the
Cluster Expert, where I am building a knowledgebase of cluster and
grid information.&nbsp; When someone asks a question I am researching
the answer to build this knowledgebase out.&nbsp; I received the
following question: <br><br><b>&quot;I am looking for a variety of
solutions to be a backbone of a large-file streaming system providing
thousands of concurrent download streams. Preferably commodity
hardware and Linux, though I'm open to commercial solutions.&quot;</b><br><br>I
am wondering if anyone here has suggestions of what applications will
work best for this type of setup. You can respond to the question at
<a href="http://www.clusterbuilder.org/FAQ"><span style="text-decoration: none;">www.clusterbuilder.org/FAQ
</span></a></font><font face="Arial, sans-serif">or respond in email.
