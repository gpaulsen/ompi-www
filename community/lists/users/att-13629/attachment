<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" ><tr><td valign="top" style="font: inherit;">I think I forgot to mention earlier that the application I am using is pre-compiled. It is a finite element software called LS-DYNA. It is not open source and I likely cannot obtain the code it uses for MPP. This version I am using was specifically compiled, by the parent company, for OpenMPI 1.4.2 MPP operations. <br><br>I recently installed the Sun Studio 12.1 to attempt to analyze the situation. It seems to work partially. It will record various processes individually, which is cryptic. The function it fails on, though, is the MPI Tracing. It errors that "no MPI tracing data file in experiment, MPI Timeline and MPI Charts will not be available". Sometime during the analysis (about 10,000 iterations later, the VT_MAX_FLUSHES complains that there are too many i/o flushes and its not happy. I've increased this number in the environmental variable and killed the
 analysis before it had a chance to error but still no MPI Trace data is recorded. Not sure if you guys have heard of that happening or know any way to fix it...Did OpenMPI need to be configured/built for Sun Studio use?<br><br>I also noticed that from the data I do get back, there are two sets of functions for everything. There is mpi_recv and then my_recv_, both with the same % utilization time. The mpi one comes from your program's library and the my_recv_ one comes from my program. Is that typical or should the program I'm using be saying mpi_recv only? This data may be enough to help me see what's wrong so I will pass it along. Keep in mind this is percent time of total run time and not percent of MPI communication. I attached the information in a picture rather than me attempting to format a nice table in this nasty e-mail application.<br>I blacked out items that are related to LS-DYNA but afterward I just realized that I think every function with
 an _ at the end represents a command issuing from LS-DYNA. <br><br>These are my big spenders. The processes I did not include are in the bottom 4%. The processes that would be above these were the LS-DYNA applications at 100%. Like I mentioned earlier, there are two instances of every MPI command, and they carry the same percent usage. It's curious that this version, built for OpenMPI, uses different functions. <br><br>Just for a little more background info, OpenMPI is being launched from a local hard drive on each machine, but the LS-DYNA job files, and related data output files, are on a mounted drive on that machine, where the mounted drive is located on a different machine also in the cluster. We were thinking that might be an issue but it isn't writing enough data for me to think that would significantly decrease MPP performance.<br><br>I would like to make one last mention. That is that OpenMPI running 8 cores on a single node, with all the
 communication, works flawlessly. It works much faster than the Shared Memory Parallel (SMP) version of LS-DYNA that we currently have used scaled to 8 cores. LS-DYNA seems to be approximately 25% faster (don't quote me on that) when using the OpenMPI installation than when using the standard SMP, which is awesome. My point being that OpenMPI seems to be working fine, even with the screwy mounted drive. This leads me to continue to point at the network.<br><br>Anyhow, let me know if anything seems weird on the OpenMPI communication subroutines. I don't have any numbers to lean on from experience.<br><br>Sorry this e-mail was long.

<br>A quick look at top shows me kernel usage is almost twice what cpu usage is! On a 16 core job, (8 cores per node so 2 nodes total) test, OpenMPI was consuming ~65% of the cpu for kernel related items rather than number-crunching related items...Granted, we are running on GigE, but this is a finite element code we are running with no heavy data transfer within it. I'm looking into benchmarking tools, but my sysadmin is not very open to
 installing third party softwares. Do you have any suggestions for what I can use that would be "big name" or guaranteed safe tools I can use to figure out what's causing the hold up with all the kernel usage? I'm pretty sure its network traffic but I have no way of telling (as far as I know because I'm not a Linux whiz) with the standard tools in RHEL.<br>
