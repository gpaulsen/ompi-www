<br>
First of all I want to congratulate all of you because the quality of<br>
the community, I have solved a lot of doubts just reading the mailing<br>
list.<br>
<br>
However I have a question that I can not solve... Until now I though<br>
that all the collective operations have an implicit sincronization, but<br>
I can see that this is not true at all (because optimizations?). Then,<br>
after searching a little bit on the web I saw that there are several<br>
implementations of the reduction in openmpi, in fact there are 6<br>
possible algorithm (at least on OMPI 1.6) that you can use by mean of<br>
the mca parameters...<br>
<br>
I thought that one of them behaves as a synchronization but after<br>
execute a test with each one, no one behaves as it. Then my question<br>
is, there is any possibility, by tuning ompi, the reduce operation<br>
syncrhonize all the ranks that are involved at the end of the<br>
operation?<br>
<br>
Also I would like to know if there is any mechanism to know at runtime<br>
which algorithm is being used.<br>
<br>
Thanks for all!<br>
