    for the v1.8/v1.10 series, the fix is available at
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://github.com/ggouaillardet/ompi-release/commit/c301bab8c9aff76eb7a3ee56b965b6ff3cf0073c.diff">https://github.com/ggouaillardet/ompi-release/commit/c301bab8c9aff76eb7a3ee56b965b6ff3cf0073c.diff</a><br>
    <br>
    fwiw<br>
    - i ran the test program under the debugger, and the datatype is the
    same before and after MPI_Type_create_resize (e.g. the compiler did
    not add extra padding for alignment)<br>
    - if you need MPI_Type_create_resize to handle some alignment, it
    *might* be more efficient to manually<br>
      add some padding so everything is well aligned *and* send the
    padding with the rest of the message<br>
      (so you only send/recv a contiguous block of data). there is a
    trade-off between the size of the data to be<br>
      sent, and the complexity of the datatype that requires more cpu
    and less efficient internal memory copy.<br>
    <br>
    Cheers,<br>

      that is definetly a bug in OpenMPI, and i will push a fix shortly<br>
      (well, at least when github is back online ...)<br>
      <br>
      Thanks and regards,<br>

        <pre wrap="">In case the last message came out garbled because newlines were removed, I've send it again. Anyway,I've been trying to create a derived datatype for use in one-sided communication, and I find that attempting to modify the extents to account for potential alignment issues is making things *worse*, at least when one-sided communication is used. Modifying extents seems to work fine when using the datatype for two-sided communication, however. I also find that the problem seems to occur with the version of OpenMPI on my workstation (which, unfortunately, is a prior stable release, 1.8.5), but not with Cray's MPICH. Mainly, I'm trying to figure out if there's a problem with my code that OpenMPI is catching but Cray is not, or if the problem is at OpenMPI's end. The attached test code that triggers the problem for me when compiled with "-DADJ_EXTENT".
