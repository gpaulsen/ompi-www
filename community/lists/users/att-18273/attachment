It seems the split is blocking when must return MPI_COMM_NULL, in the case I have one process with a color that does not exist in the other group or with the color = MPI_UNDEFINED.<div><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Wed, Jan 25, 2012 at 4:28 PM, Rodrigo Oliveira <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:rsilva.oliveira@gmail.com">rsilva.oliveira@gmail.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br>

Maybe there is some problem when you call the split function having one client process with color = MPI_UNDEFINED. I understood you are trying to isolate one of the client process to do something applicable only to it, am I wrong?
