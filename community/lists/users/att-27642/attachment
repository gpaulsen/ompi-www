&gt; FYI, you can also see what they have done in mpi4py to by-pass this problem.<br>
<br>
</span>Could you elaborate on this or give me some pointer to other resources?<br>
<span class=""><br>
&gt; I would actually highly recommend you to use mpi4py rather than implementing this from scratch your-self ;)<br>
<br>
</span>I fully agree that it is a bad idea to implement something like mpi4py from scratch. However, I don稚 plan to do this and<br>
I知 not sure if mpi4py will work for us. This problem initially came up when<br>
working on a thin layer around some parallel netcdf functionality to request and compare data from NetCDF (especially CDF-5) files.<br>
It is written in C++ due to performance reasons. Additionally, I知 not sure if there is any up-to-date python library for parallel netcdf that could help here.<br>
As you can see, we don稚 need full blown MPI features in python, and so I知 not really sure if mpi4py can help us.<br>
<br>
Please correct me if I知 wrong!<br>
<br>
Best,<br>
Joel<br>
