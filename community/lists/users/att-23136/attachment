<div dir="ltr"><div><div><div>The Java bindings were revised because (a) the old ones had significantly bit-rotted, (b) we wanted to improve performance by making the code truly a &quot;binding&quot; instead of just a wrapper around MPI calls, and (c) we wanted to extend coverage to all of the current MPI standard. Hence the changes.<br>
<br></div>The bindings are now stable, which is why they are now coming to a release series. Things in our devel trunk are not guaranteed stable. Note that things in a &quot;feature&quot; series (one that has an odd number in the second part - e.g., 1.7) are not necessarily fully stable as they can undergo changes prior to inclusion in a &quot;super-stable&quot; series (an even number in the second part). At that time, only bug fixes are allowed.<br>
<br>That said, we don&#39;t anticipate changes to the Java binding APIs.<br><br></div>The new bindings are documented via javadocs and man pages, which should help in the transition. If you have specific questions, I suspect some of the folks more directly involved will try to help.<br>

I&#39;ve installed nightly 1.7.4 recently and it&#39;s Java API is completely<br>
different from mpiJava.<br>
Is there guide or something to new Open MPI Java bindings? Or will it<br>
come out later (in some resonable time)?<br>
Specifically, I&#39;m interested in how to port existing sources from old<br>
mpiJava to new Open MPI Java bindings<br>
and comments explaining reasons of changing each part of API.<br>
Is there determined time when new Java bindings will become stable or<br>
it&#39;s done when it&#39;s done?<br>
Also, what is the best version of Java API implementation for now?<br>
<br>
Sorry if I&#39;m asking too much :)<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
Ivan Borisov.<br>
