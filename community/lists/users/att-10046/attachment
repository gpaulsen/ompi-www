Are you asking to find out this information before issuing &quot;mpirun&quot;?  Open MPI does assume that the nodes you are trying to use are reachable.<div><div></div><div class="h5"><br>

</div></div></blockquote></div><br> NO,<br><br>Scenario is a pair of processes are running one in &quot;master&quot; node say &quot;masterprocess&quot; and one in &quot;slave&quot; node say &quot;slaveprocess&quot;. When &quot;masterprocess&quot; needs service of slave process, it sends message to &quot;slaveprocess&quot; and &quot;slaveprocess&quot; serves its request. In case of Network failure(by any means) &quot;masterprocess&quot; will keep trying to send message to &quot;slaveprocess&quot; without knowing that it is not reachable. So how &quot;masterprocess&quot; should finds out that &quot;slaveprocess&quot; can&#39;t be reached and leave attempting to send messages till Connection is not up.<br>
