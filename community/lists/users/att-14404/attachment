Hetero operations tend to lose a little performance due to the need to convert data, but otherwise there is no real negative. We don&#39;t do it by default solely because the majority of installations don&#39;t need to, and there is no reason to lose even a little performance if it isn&#39;t necessary.<div>

them at once because they have different CPU&#39;s (e.g., pentiums, athlons<br>
(both 32 bit) vs Intel I7 (64 bit)).   I&#39;m about the build 1.4.3 and was<br>
wondering if I should add --enable-heterogenous to the configure flags.<br>
Any advice as to why or why not would be appreciated.<br>
