Hey Jeff,<br>
<br>
Finally got my test nodes back and was looking at the info you sent. On
the SLURM page, it states the following:<br>
<br>
<p> <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/"><b>Open MPI</b></a> relies upon
SLURM to allocate resources for the job and then mpirun to initiate the
tasks. When using <span class="commandline">salloc</span> command, <span
 class="commandline">mpirun</span>'s -nolocal option is recommended.
For example:
</p>
<pre>$ salloc -n4 sh    # allocates 4 processors and spawns shell for job
&gt; mpirun -np 4 -nolocal a.out
&gt; exit          # exits shell spawned by initial salloc command
</pre>
You are saying that I need to use the slurm salloc, then pass SLURM a
script? Or could I just add it all into the script? Fro eaample:<br>
<br>
<pre wrap="">#!/bin/sh
salloc -n4
mpirun my_mpi_application

Then, run with srun -b myscript.sh
</pre>

  <pre wrap="">Ick; I'm surprised that we don't have this info on the FAQ.  I'll try  
to rectify that shortly.

How are you launching your jobs through SLURM?  OMPI currently does  
not support the "srun -n X my_mpi_application" model for launching  
MPI jobs.  You must either use the -A option to srun (i.e., get an  
interactive SLURM allocation) or use the -b option (submit a script  
that runs on the first node in the allocation).  Your script can be  
quite short:

#!/bin/sh
mpirun my_mpi_application

Note that OMPI will automatically figure out how many cpu's are in  
your SLURM allocation, so you don't need to specify "-np X".  Hence,  
you can run the same script without modification no matter how many  
cpus/nodes you get from SLURM.

It's on the long-term plan to get "srun -n X my_mpi_application"  
model to work; it just hasn't bubbled up high enough in the priority  
stack yet... :-\

    <pre wrap="">Just started working with OpenMPI / SLURM combo this morning. I can  
successfully launch this job from the command line and it runs to  
completion, but when launching from SLURM they hang.

They appear to just sit with no load apparent on the compute nodes  
even though SLURM indicates they are running...

Are there any known issues of this nature involving OpenMPI and SLURM?

Thanks!
