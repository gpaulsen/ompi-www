Dear,<div><br></div><div>I&#39;m using Mellanox infiniband network card and trying to run it with openmpi.</div><div>The problem is that I can connect and communicate between nodes, but I&#39;m not sure whether it is in a correct state or not.</div>
<div><br></div><div>I have two version of openmpi, one is compiled with mca-btl-openib and the other is without btl-openib.(I checked it in ompi_info)</div><div>And my jobs are running well using the openmpi without btl-openib, </div>
<div>but when I run the exactly same job using openmpi with btl-openmpi, I meet the  following error.</div><div><br></div><div><i>   mlx4: There is a mismatch between the kernel and the userspace libraries: Kernel does not support XRC. Exiting.</i></div>
<div><br></div><div>and the following is written in another log file</div><div><i>   CMA: unable to open RDMA device</i></div><div><br></div><div>What I&#39;m thinking is that the infiniband card is installed but it doesn&#39;t work in correct mode.</div>
<div>My linux kernel version is <i>2.6.18-164.el5</i>, and installed ofed version is <i>kernel-ib-pp-1.4.1-ofed20090528r1.4.1sgi605r1.rhel5 .</i><br><br></div><div>Thanks,</div><div><br></div><div>Heejin</div>
