Hi all.<br><br>I&#39;m trying to develop MPI program to solve SVD using Lanczos algorithms. However, I have no idea how to do that. Somebody suggested to take a look at <a href="http://www.netlib.org/scalapack/">http://www.netlib.org/scalapack/</a> but I cannot understand exactly what to look. Morever, I know that <b>las2</b> is the popular library to solve SVD but don&#39;t know how to use it in parallel computing.<br>

<br>Any suggestion from you is welcome.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Long Thai. <br>
