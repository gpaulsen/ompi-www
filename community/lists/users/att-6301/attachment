<div dir="ltr">Hello,<br><br>I downloaded the openmpi-1.4a1r19231 nightly and trying to configure it without RTE support. It doesn&#39;t seem to recognize the without-rte-support configure flag, or so it seems.<br>It goes on well with &quot;with-rte=no&quot;. <br>
<br>$ ./configure --without-rte-support<br>configure: WARNING: Unrecognized options: --without-rte-support<br>checking for a BSD-compatible install... /usr/bin/install -c<br>checking whether build environment is sane...<br>
[snip]<br><br>Also, any additional information I can get on this option would be great. I tried to dig up for anything on this -- the only thing I found is the original changeset 18664 by Ralph<br><a href="https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/changeset/18664">https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/changeset/18664</a><br>
