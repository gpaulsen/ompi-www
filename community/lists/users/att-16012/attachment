Hi,<div>My application performs good without shared memory utilization, but with shared memory I get performance worst than without of it.</div><div>Do I make a mistake? Don&#39;t I pay attention to something?</div><div>I know OpenMPI uses /tmp directory to allocate shared memory and it is in the local filesystem.</div>
<div><br></div><div>I thank you.</div><div>Michele.</div>
