<p>Hi Gleb <br>
<br>
There is no misunderstanding of the MPI standard or the definition of blocking in the bug3 example.  Both bug 3 and the example I provided are valid MPI.<br>
<br>
As you say, blocking means the send buffer can be reused when the MPI_Send returns.  This is exactly what bug3 is count on. <br>
<br>
MPI is a reliable protocol which means that once MPI_Send returns, the application can assume the message will be delivered once a matching recv is posted.  There are only two ways I can think of for MPI to keep that guarantee.<br>
1) Before return from MPI_Send, copy the envelop and data to some buffer that will be preserved until the MPI_Recv gets posted<br>
2) delay the return from MPI_Send until the MPI_Recv is posted and then move data from the intact send buffer to the posted receive buffer. Return from MPI_Send<br>
<br>
The requirement in the standard is that if libmpi takes option 1, the return from MPI_Send cannot occur unless there is certainty the buffer space exists. Libmpi cannot throw the message over the wall and fail the job if it cannit be buffered.<br>
