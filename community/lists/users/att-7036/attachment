<p>Hi, all:<br>
<br>
I have one cluster without Internet connection. I want to test OpenMPI functions on it. It seems MTT can not be used. Do I have any other choice for the testing?<br>
<br>
I have tried lamtest. &quot;make -k check&quot; gave a lot of IB related warnings, indicating that my dat.conf file contained invalid entry. Each machine of my cluster has one IB connectX adapter installed. But do not know why lamtest detected that.<br>
