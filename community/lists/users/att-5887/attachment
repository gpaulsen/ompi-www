Dear Sir: <br>
&nbsp;<br>
I am trying to install Open MPI on a cluster that has been installed with mpich-<br>
gm&nbsp; MPI. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
I have followed the steps on your website. <br>
I can compile and run the Hello_c application correctly.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
But, how can I make sure that the application is run by Open MPI not by mpich-<br>
gm MPI ? <br>
&nbsp;<br>
I have changed PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I deleted /opt/mpich-gm/bin from PATH and added <br>
/ptmp/myname/openmpi123/ompi123_install/bin/ into PATH. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/ptmp/myname/openmpi123/ompi123_install/lib<br>
&nbsp;<br>
And then, I got <br>
&nbsp;<br>
-bash-3.00$ which mpirun<br>/ptmp/myname/openmpi123/ompi123_install/bin/mpirun <br>
&nbsp;<br>
In my job script , I used <br>
&nbsp;<br>
"time mpirun -np 16&nbsp; /ptmp/jxding/openmpi123/openmpi-1.2.3/examples/hello_c"<br><br>Then I added "which mpirun" in my job script, and then submited my job to the <br>cluster , I got :<br>====================================<br>
/opt/mpich-gm/bin/mpirun<br>Hello, world, I am 0 of 1<br>Hello, world, I am 0 of 1<br>Hello, world, I am 0 of 1<br>Hello, world, I am 0 of 1<br>Hello, world, I am 0 of 1<br>Hello, world, I am 0 of 1<br>Hello, world, I am 0 of 1<br>Hello, world, I am 0 of 1<br>Hello, world, I am 0 of 1<br>Hello, world, I am 0 of 1<br>Hello, world, I am 0 of 1<br>Hello, world, I am 0 of 1<br>Hello, world, I am 0 of 1<br>Hello, world, I am 0 of 1<br>Hello, world, I am 0 of 1<br>Hello, world, I am 0 of 1<br>0.117u 0.165s 0:09.54 2.8%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0+0k 0+0io 0pf+0w<br>
====================================<br>
So , it means that the application is still using MPICH-GM not Open MPI.<br>
Would you please help me with that ?<br>
<br>thanks, <br>
&nbsp;<br>
Tony<br>
