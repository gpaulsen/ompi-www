Actually I had a much differnt results,<br>
<br>
gromacs-3.3.1 &nbsp;one node dual core dual socket opt2218 &nbsp;openmpi-1.2.7 &nbsp;pgi/7.2<br>
mpich2 gcc<br>
</blockquote><div><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; For some reason, the difference in minutes didn&#39;t come through, it seems, but I would guess that if it&#39;s a medium-large difference, then it has its roots in PGI7.2 vs. GCC rather than MPICH2 vs. OpenMPI.&nbsp; Though, to be fair, I find GCC vs. PGI (for C code) is often a toss-up - one may beat the other handily on one code, and then lose just as badly on another.<br>

So take my mpich2 numbers with salt, Lots of salt.</blockquote>
<div><br>&nbsp; I think the biggest difference in performance with various MPICH2 install comes from differences in the &#39;channel&#39; used..&nbsp; I tend to make sure that I use the &#39;nemesis&#39; channel, which may or may not be the default these days.&nbsp; If not, though, most people would probably want it.&nbsp; I think it has issues with threading (or did ages ago?), but I seem to recall it being considerably faster than even the &#39;ssm&#39; channel.<br>
&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; Sangamesh:&nbsp; My advice to you would be to recompile Gromacs and specify, in the <i>Gromacs</i> compile / configure, to use the same CFLAGS you used with MPICH2.&nbsp; Eg, &quot;-O2 -m64&quot;, whatever.&nbsp; If you do that, I bet the times between MPICH2 and OpenMPI will be pretty comparable for your benchmark case - especially when run on a single processor.<br>
