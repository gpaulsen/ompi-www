It's probably not the same issue as this is one of the very few codes
that I maintain which is C++ and not fortran :-(<br>
<br>
It behaved similarly on another system when I built it against a new
version (1.0??) of MVAPICH. I had to roll back a version from that as
well.<br>
<br>
I may contact the lammps people and see if they know what's going on as
well.<br>

fixed in tonight's 1.3.1 nightly snapshot.

Can you try a recent snapshot of 1.3.1
    <br>
(<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.open-mpi.org/nightly/v1.3/">http://www.open-mpi.org/nightly/v1.3/</a>) to verify if this has been

I tried it with a couple of different versions of the lammps source,

but to no avail. No errors during the builds and a binary was created,

but when executing the job it quickly exits with no messages other

      <br>
Interestingly, I downloaded Open MPI 1.2.8, built it with the same
      <br>
configure options I had used with 1.3, and it worked.
      <br>
      <br>
I'm getting by fine with 1.2.8. I just wanted to file a possible bug
      <br>
report on 1.3 and see if others have seen this behavior.
      <br>
      <br>
Cheers!
