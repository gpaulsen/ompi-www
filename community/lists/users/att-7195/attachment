<font color="#000099" face="Comic Sans MS">I just found out I need to
switch from mpich2 to openMPI for some code I'm running.&nbsp; I noticed
that it's available in an openSuSE repo (I'm using openSuSE 11.0 x86_64
on a TYAN 32-processor Opteron 8000 system), but when I was using
mpich2 I seemed to have better luck compiling it from code.&nbsp; This is
the line I used:<br>

F77=/path/to/g95 F90=/path/to/g95 ./configure
--prefix=/some/place/mpich2-install<br>
<br>
</font></font><font color="#0000ff" size="2"><font size="3"><font
 color="#000099">But usually I left the "--prefix=" off and just let it
install to it's default...&nbsp; which is /usr/local/bin and that's nice
because it's already in the PATH and very usable.&nbsp; I guess my question
is whether or not the defaults and configuration syntax have stayed the
same in openMPI.&nbsp; I also could use a "quickstart" guide for a
non-programming user (e.g., I think I have to start a daemon before
running parallelized programs).<br>
