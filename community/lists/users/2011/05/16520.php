<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt; We had a user-reported issue of some hangs that the IB vendors have

</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; it may be an issue with the oob openib CPC, but that code is pretty

<span class="quotelev1">&gt; old and pretty mature, so all of us would be at least somewhat
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; surprised if that were the case.  If anyone can reliably reproduce

<span class="quotelev1">&gt; this error, please let us know and/or give us access to your machines
</span><br>
<p>We can reproduce it with IMB.  We could provide access, but we'd have to
<br>
negotiate with the owners of the relevant nodes to give you interactive
<br>
access to them.  Maybe Brock's would be more accessible?  (If you
<br>
contact me, I may not be able to respond for a few days.)
<br>
<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt; -- we have not closed this issue,
</span><br>
<p>Which issue?   I couldn't find a relevant-looking one.
<br>
<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt; but are unable to move forward
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; because the customers who reported this issue switched to rdmacm and
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; moved on (i.e., we don't have access to their machines to test any
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; more).
</span><br>
<p>For what it's worth, I figured out why I couldn't see rdmacm, but adding
<br>
ipoib would be a bit of a pain.
