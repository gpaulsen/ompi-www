After setting OPAL_PKGDATADIR, &quot;mpirun&quot; gives proper help message.
<br>
<p>But when executing simple test program which calls MPI_ALLREDUCE() it
<br>
gives following errors onto the console...
<br>
<p>c:\ompi_tests\win64&gt;mpirun mar_f_i_op.exe
<br>
[nbld-w08:04820] [[30632,0],0] ORTE_ERROR_LOG: Error in file
<br>

<br>

<br>
<p>Any idea on these errors???
<br>
<p>Clarification: I installed pre-built OpenMPI_v1.5.3-x64 on Windows 7
<br>
and copied this directory into Windows Server 2008.
<br>
<p>Thank you in advance.
