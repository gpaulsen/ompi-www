Hi,
<br>
<p>I am observing following message on Windows platform...
<br>
<p>c:\Users\oza\Desktop\test&gt;mpirun
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;orterun:executable-not-specified
<br>
But I couldn't open the help file:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C:\Users\hpcfan\Documents\OpenMPI\openmpi-1.5.3\installed-64\share\openmpi\help-orterun.txt:
<br>
No such file or directory.  Sorry!
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>I copied pre-built installed &quot;OpenMPI_v1.5.3-x64&quot; directory into one
<br>
Windows machine to another  Windows machine.
<br>
<p>As discussed in some mailing-threads I also tried to set OPAL_PKGDATA
<br>
and other OPAL_* environment variables, but still above message
<br>
persist.
<br>
<p>Please suggest.
<br>
<p>Thank you in advance.
<br>
