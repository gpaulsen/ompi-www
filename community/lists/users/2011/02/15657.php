Hi Ashley,
<br>
<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt; If you do this I would appreciate the chance to proof-read it before you go
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; public...
</span><br>
<p>Absolutely!  I am a firm believer in two-heads-are-better-than-
<br>
one concept.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Tena

<span class="quotelev1">&gt; public, I have many thousands of hours of EC2 time to my name and have spent
