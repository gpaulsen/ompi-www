<div>That being said, should we remove these fortran types from include files and libs when ompi is configure'd without fortran support ?<br>

&gt; BTW: is there a reason you don't want to just use the C datatypes?&nbsp; The fundamental output of the index is an integer value -- casting it to a float of some flavor doesn't fundamentally change its value.

<div>The code in question is not mine.&nbsp; I have suggested to the developers that they should use the correct C types.&nbsp; The reason I became aware of this issue is that one of my colleagues compiled and ran this code on a system where OpenMPI was built without
 Fortran support and the code started failing with errors from MPI which were not seen on other systems.</div>

<div>If you use an MPI library compiled without Fortran support, you should expect precisely nothing related to Fortran to work.&nbsp; You might get more than this because the universe is being nice to you, but you should treat it as serendipity when something works,
 not a bug when something doesn't.</div>
