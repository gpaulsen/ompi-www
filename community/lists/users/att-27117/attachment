      <br>
        I know I saw this issue years ago but have forgotten the
      details. I looked through old posts but only found about half a
      dozen pertaining to WinDoze.  I am trying to build a Python
      (2.7.3) extension (h5py) that calls HDF5 (1.8.14).  I built both
      the OpenMPI (1.8.4) and the HDF5 modules so I know they are
      consistent.  All goes well until I try to run the tests. Then I
      get:
      <br>
      <br>
      ImportError:
      /N/dc2/projects/ray/quarry/h5py/h5py-2.5.0/build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.7/h5py/_errors.so:
      undefined symbol: ompi_mpi_info_null
      <br>
      <br>
      I am not sure I completely trust the h5py package but I don't have
      a real good reason for believing that way.  I would appreciate it
      if someone could explain where ompi_mpi_info_null is defined and
      possibly a way to tell Python about it.  Thanks!
