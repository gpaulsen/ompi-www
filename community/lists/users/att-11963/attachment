Thanks Shiqing!<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work, but I've got more info.<br>
<br>
I can use wmic to start an application on the remote machine, but that
application does not start in the current login process (notepad.exe
starts, but I have to ask task manager to show all processes to find
it, even though I'm currently logged in as the same user).&nbsp; I believe
this is expected behavior, please let me know if it's not.<br>
<br>
When using mpirun, I can verify that orted starts on the remote
machine, but the crash or hang appears to happen before the application
starts execution.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oddly, orted does not appear to start on the local
machine.&nbsp; Logs all refer to mpirun crashing.<br>
<br>
<br>
Cheers!<br>

You don't need to install anything, but just a few security setting has
to be correctly configured. Here are two links might be helpful (will
be added into README.WINDOWS too):

  <br>
On the other hand, in order to check if WMI is working between the
nodes, you can try with command:
  <br>
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\&gt;wmic /node:192.168.0.1 /user:username process call create
notepad.exe
  <br>
  <br>
the ip has to be the remote computer ip address, and the user name is
which you use on remote computer. This command line will simply launch
a non-interactive notepad (no GUI) on remote node using WMI, if it is
successful, you should be able to see a notepad process in Task Manager
or Process Viewer, and that also means mpirun will work through WMI.
  <br>
  <br>
Could you check with the above command, and possibly tell me the return
value, so that I can help you to make it work.
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
Regards,
  <br>

The application executes correctly on both machines, when only launched

on a single host.

    <br>
I believe mpirun is using WMI, README.WINDOWS indicates that this is
the
    <br>
case if I don't have the CCP toolkit and SDK installed, which I don't.&nbsp;
Additionally, I have encountered and resolved some security issues
    <br>
following this assumption.
    <br>
    <br>
Any advice is welcome.&nbsp; I'm not married to WMI, so if the solution is
    <br>
"install something else" I'm great with that.

Thanks!
