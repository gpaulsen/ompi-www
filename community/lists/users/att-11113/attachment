Thanks for the reply Pallab. Firewall is not an issue as I can passwordless-SSH to/from both machines.<br>My problem is to deal with 32bit &amp; 64bit architectures simultaneously (and not with different operating systems). Can it be possible through open-MPI???<br>
<br>Look forward to the solution!<br><br>Thanks,<br>Yogesh<br><br><br><strong>From:</strong> Pallab Datta (<em>datta_at_[hidden]</em>)<br><br>I have had issues for running in cross platforms..ie. Mac OSX and Linux
<br>
(Ubuntu)..haven&#39;t got it resolved..check firewalls if thats blocking any
<br>
communication..

Dear Open-mpi users,<br><br>I have installed openmpi on 2 different
machines with different architectures (INTEL and x86_64) separately
(command: ./configure --enable-heterogeneous). Compiled executables of
the same code for these 2 arch. Kept these executables on individual
machines. Prepared a hostfile containing the names of those 2 machines.<br>
Now, when I want to execute the code (giving command - ./mpirun
-hostfile machines executable), it doesn&#39;t work, giving error message:<br><br>MPI_ABORT was invoked on rank 2 in communicator MPI_COMM_WORLD<br>with errorcode 1.<br><br>NOTE: invoking MPI_ABORT causes Open MPI to kill all MPI processes.<br>

You may or may not see output from other processes, depending on<br>exactly when Open MPI kills them.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>

mpirun has exited due to process rank 2 with PID 1712 on<br>node studpc1.xxx.xxxx.xx exiting without calling &quot;finalize&quot;. This may<br>have caused other processes in the application to be<br>terminated by signals sent by mpirun (as reported here)<br>

<br>When I keep only one machine-name in the hostfile, then the execution works perfect.<br><br>Will anybody please guide me to run the program on heterogeneous environment using mpirun!<br><br>Thanking you,<br><br>Sincerely,<br>
