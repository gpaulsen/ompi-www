&gt; Hi All,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I have a question similar (but not identical to) the one asked by Tom Fogel a week or so back...<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I have a code that uses MPI_Comm_spawn to launch different processes. The executables for these use libraries in non-standard locations, so what I&#39;ve done is add the directories containing them to my LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable, and then calling mpirun with &quot;-x LD_LIBRARY_PATH&quot;. This works well for me on OpenMPI 1.6.3 and earlier. However, I&#39;ve been playing with OpenMPI 1.7.3 and this no longer seems to work. As soon as my code MPI_Comm_spawns, all the spawned processes die complaining that they can&#39;t find the correct libraries to start the executable.<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; Has there been a way that exported variables are passed to spawned processes between OpenMPI 1.6 and 1.7?<br>
<br>
</div></div>Not intentionally, though it is possible that some bug crept into the code. If I understand correctly, the -x values are being seen by the original procs, but not by the comm_spawned ones?<br>
<div class="im"><br>
<br>
&gt; Is there something else I&#39;m doing wrong here?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Best Regards,<br>
&gt; Tim<br>
