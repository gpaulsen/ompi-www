<div dir="ltr">Hi devs,<div>I am using THREAD_MULTIPLE in openmpi version 1.8.4. However I occasionally see following warning and my application gets hanged up intermittently. Does this mean thread multiple mode is not supported in 1.8.4 ? Or does openmpi has a version that fully supports this ?</div><div><br></div><div>opal_libevent2021_event_base_loop: reentrant invocation; Â Only one event_base_loop can run on each event_base at once.<br></div>
