Just a brief response on two points (lest the 'insiders' think
<br>
there are no sympathetic outsiders...).

&nbsp;
<br>
a)
<br>
It has not been my experience that a paper trail makes the
<br>
class of people prone to theivery any less prone to theivery.
<br>
The sad reality of ineffective (totally absent?) quality control by
<br>
journals and conferences makes the deterrent effect unlikely.
<br>
<p>b)
<br>
On the release issue, the '&quot;slow stable&quot; plus snapshots' release
<br>
cycle (after the initial stable point) seems very desirable to me.
<br>
I've lost countless months of time making my primary open-source
<br>
deliverable appear &quot;stable&quot; to the users in spite of deep instabilities
<br>
in external tools I am forced to incorporate for programmatic reasons.
<br>
<p>open-mpi, I can guarantee, will be added to this list of external
<br>
dependencies I have to cope with and I'm thrilled to see folks aiming 
<br>
to keep the quality high in the first release.
<br>
<p>What I would like to see, as the developer of another (non-competing)
<br>
infrastructure tool set, is some sort of little web form or at
<br>
least an email link where
<br>
I can put in a description of my project and say why it should be
<br>
given early access, rather than just being told &quot;sorry, closed&quot;.
<br>
<p>It takes time to incorporate a new mpi implementation (and yet
<br>
another set of awful build requirement peculiarities) into a
<br>
a package like mine that is expected to be portable and to cope
<br>
seamlessly with every mpi that comes along. I can guarantee
<br>
that within days of the open-mpi download becoming public,
<br>
people will be dumping hatemail in *my* mailbox because the
<br>
toolset i support isn't 'open-mpi-ready'.
<br>
As it happens, I can get a bootleg (not necessarily current)
<br>
openmpi tarball from
<br>
someone nearby as I work at Sandia, but that shouldn't have
<br>
to be the case. Wouldn't it be better if (knowing that
<br>
testing comes with certain politeness requirements and testing
<br>
duties) those who have to support open-mpi users get to do
<br>
gamma-testing programming before the release (since beta is closed)?
<br>
<p>On the question of 'benefit of more testers' from 'my' class
<br>
of user. You're right, i don't have the slightest interest
<br>
in examining or reporting bugs down in 95% of your code.
<br>
(unless valgrind tells me otherwise...)
<br>
But the 5% of code which the end user (and more importantly
<br>
down-stream build systems) have to see is likely to be
<br>
gone over with a fine-toothed comb.
<br>
<p>thanks,
<br>
<p>Ben
