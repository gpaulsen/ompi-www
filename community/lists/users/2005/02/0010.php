Hi,
<br>
<p>First off, I noticed in a previous posting that bproc
<br>
was supported. Will this also be true for Mosix and/or
<br>
OpenMosix?
<br>
<p>Second, I've been monitoring the progress of various
<br>
MPI projects for a while. I've seen no progress on
<br>
IPMI for some time. Likewise, the very-high-speed
<br>
MP-MPICH project (which provides optimized support for
<br>
things like SCI) seems to be comatose at best.
<br>
<p>What, if anything, will be utilized from these
<br>
projects? Or will it be assumed that the failures
<br>
indicate a flaw in the concept or design?
<br>
<p>Third, there are several projects which utilize
<br>
modified versions of MPICH - implying there may be a
<br>
lack of some critical hooks in MPI implementations.
<br>
The projects I know of that do this are Globus (a grid
<br>
computing system) and Gamma (a very low level, low
<br>
latency IPC system).
<br>
<p>What, if anything, has been learned from such projects
<br>
and what sort of support will Open-MPI provide to
<br>
cover such cases? One thing I would like to see is the
<br>
ability to load/unload modules on-the-fly on systems
<br>
that support a working dlopen(), in a similar manner
<br>
to the Linux kernel.
<br>
<p>Finally, with regards to the development process - do
<br>
you have a mechanism in place for external developers
<br>
to track bugs, submit fixes/extensions, etc?
<br>
<p>Engaging the interest of a significant number of Open
<br>
Source developers is hard, but it appears to be true
<br>
that the more transparent the process, the greater the
<br>
success.
<br>
<p>I know plenty of &quot;Open Source&quot; scientific/academic
<br>
projects where the administrators won't even permit
<br>
the project to be listed on Open Source catalogues and
<br>
databases. Needless to say, such projects evolve
<br>
painfully slowly or fall apart entirely. The
<br>
assumption that internal effort is enough often proves
<br>
optimistic.
<br>
<p>What plans do you have to avoid the pitfalls of other
<br>
projects?
<br>
<p>Jonathan Day
