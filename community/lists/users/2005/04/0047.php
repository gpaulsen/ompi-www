<p>No, because we apparently disagree about what MorphMPI is. You claim
<br>
it's a lot less work than an ABI; I claim it's about the same. We
<br>
both agreed that in both cases, most of the work was building a 
<br>
C interface which is similar to the existing F77 interface. So
<br>
where's the extra work you say an ABI needs?
<br>
<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt; Who, exactly, wants an MPI ABI?
</span><br>
<p>If you look at the original presentation, the biggest win is for
<br>
<p>1) Customers who run &quot;canned&quot; applications, both commercial and free
<br>
2) People who produce these apps
<br>
3) Vendors of unusual interconnect hardware.
<br>
<p>Recall that I also said that MPI implementers have the least
<br>
motivation, because they have to do some work. For example, since
<br>
you didn't see any benefit from avoiding recompiling, it's no
<br>
surprise that you don't see anything but a negative from an ABI.
<br>
<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt; Have there been any formal surveys conducted?
</span><br>
<p>Not yet. We're at the trial balloon phase. Obviously demand has to be
<br>
proven before anyone is going to do much work on an ABI. In April I
<br>
will be attending 2 conferences with lots of people in the (1)-(3)
<br>
categories; that will give me a chance to talk to a bunch of people
<br>
who tend not to post to email lists.
