<p>Actually, checking the web archives of this thread 
<br>
(<a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/users/2005/03/0028.php">http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/users/2005/03/0028.php</a>), as 
<br>
far as I can tell, I have replied to each of your points.  I re-posted 
<br>
the MorphMPI attributes because I hadn't seen a direct response from 
<br>
you about them.
<br>
<p>However, it is possible that I missed your reply; in the web archives, 
<br>
I see one offhand comment from you that a MorphMPI-like approach is 
<br>
simply an implementation detail, and you saw no problems with it -- is 
<br>
this what you were referring to?
<br>
<p>If so, are we therefore in agreement that a MorphMPI-like approach is a 
<br>
good first step?
<br>
<p>I have a followup question:
<br>
<p>Who, exactly, wants an MPI ABI?  I have seen a vocal few voice their 
<br>
opinions (both for and against).  But these are not representative of 
<br>
the overall HPC community.  Have there been any formal surveys 
<br>
conducted?  What methodology was used to gather this data?  The reason 
<br>
that I ask is because one of the criteria that any software developer 
<br>
uses to determine whether to implement something is user demand.  What 
<br>
percentage of users actively want or need an MPI ABI?  Who are they, 
<br>
and what are *their* reasons why?  Would their needs be solved by a 
<br>
MorphMPI approach?  Why or why not?
<br>
<p>This, I think, is a critical missing piece to this discussion.  If 
<br>
there is a critical mass of users (and more importantly, funders) who 
<br>
want/need an MPI ABI, then the whole effort is something that has a 
<br>
much better chance of going forward.
