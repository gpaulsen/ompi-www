have a cluster where both HCA's of blade are active, but connected to different
subnet.</font>
<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is
there an option in MPI to select one HCA out of available one's? I know
it can be done by making changes in openmpi code, but i need clean interface
like option during mpi launch time to select mthca0 or mthca1?</font>

help is appreciated. Btw i just checked Mvapich and feature is there inside.</font>
