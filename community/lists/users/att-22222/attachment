There is a simple test for this. Add an MPI_Alltoall with a reasonable size (100k) before you start posting the non-blocking receives, and let's see if this solves your issue.<br><br>&nbsp; George.<br><br><br>On Jun 26, 2013, at 04:02 , eblosch@1scom.net wrote:<br><br>&gt; An update: I recoded the mpi_waitall as a loop over the requests with<br>&gt; mpi_test and a 30 second timeout.&nbsp; The timeout happens unpredictably,<br>&gt; sometimes after 10 minutes of run time, other times after 15 minutes, for<br>&gt; the exact same case.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; After 30 seconds, I print out the status of all outstanding receive<br>&gt; requests.&nbsp; The message tags that are outstanding have definitely been<br>&gt; sent, so I am wondering why they are not getting received?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; As I said before, everybody posts non-blocking standard receives, then<br>&gt; non-blocking standard sends, then calls mpi_waitall.

If I run with 960 processes (60<br>&gt;&gt; nodes of 16 cores each), things seem to work.&nbsp; If I use 160 processes<br>&gt;&gt; (each process handling 6 chunks of work), then each process is handling 6<br>&gt;&gt; times as much communication, and that is the case that hangs with OpenMPI<br>&gt;&gt; 1.6.4; again, seems to work with MVAPICH.&nbsp; Is there an obvious place to<br>&gt;&gt; start, diagnostically?&nbsp; We're using the openib btl.<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Thanks,<br>&gt;&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Ed<br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; users mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; users@open-mpi.org<br>&gt;&gt; http://www.open-mpi.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/users<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; users mailing list<br>&gt; users@open-mpi.org<br>&gt; http://www.open-mpi.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/users<br><br><br>_______________________________________________<br>users mailing list<br>users@open-mpi.org<br>http://www.open-mpi.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/users<br></body>
