Subject: Re: [OMPI users] Segmentation fault (11) Address not mapped (1)<br>It&#39;s not entirely clear that this means that it is a bug in Open MPI -- there&#39;s not really enough information here to say where the problem is.&nbsp; All that is clear is that a seg fault is happening somewhere in LAPACK.</div>

<p>FWIW, I don&#39;t see MPI in the call stack of the segv at all.&nbsp; This doesn&#39;t definitively mean that MPI is not involved, but it does suggest that the bug is elsewhere.&nbsp; You might want to run this under a debugger or examine the generated corefiles to see exactly what the problem was.</p>

Here are two other threads with similar issues regarding openmpi on Ubuntu and OSX which were solved: <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/binutils/+bug/234837">https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/binutils/+bug/234837</a><br>
