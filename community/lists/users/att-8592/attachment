Hi Ralph,<br>what do you mean to create/define a directly interface?<br><br>The 3 hosts are network connected and ssh pub key enabled. Every hosts can see the other but they are not all on the same direct connected network . More in detail:<br>
grid01 and grid04 are in the same network<br>grid03 is on different network.<br><br>Although this difference the jobs on grid01 and grid03 run properly like that on grid01 and grid04. But the jobs that include simultaneously grid03 and grid04 fail.<br>
