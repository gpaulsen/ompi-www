<div dir="ltr">Hello All,<br><br><p>I have an MPI program for having multiple processes read from a file 
that contains list of file names and based on the file names read - it 
reads the corresponding file and counts the frequency of words. </p>

<p>If one of the processes completes this and returns - to block 
executing MPI_Barrier(), the other processes also hang. On debugging, it
 could be seen that the <em>readFile()</em> function is not entered by the other processes currently in <em>process_files()</em>.</p><p> Unable to figure out why this happens. Please find the code <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32413612/as-one-mpi-process-executes-mpi-barrier-other-processes-hang">here</a></p><p>Any suggestions would be very much helpful!</p><p><br></p><p>Thank you,</p><div><div class="gmail_signature"><div>Dhanashree</div></div>
