Hello,<br><br>my question is the following.<br><br>is it possible to send and receive C++ objects or STL structures (for example, send map&lt;a,b&gt; myMap) through openMPI SEND and RECEIVE functions?<br>at first glance i thought it was possible, but after reading some doc, im not sure.<br>

i dont have my source code at that stage for testing yet<br><br><br clear="all">Cristobal<br><br><br>
