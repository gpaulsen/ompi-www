Currently Open MPI only supports the checkpointing of the whole application. There has been some work on uncoordinated checkpointing with message logging, though I do not know the state of that work with regards to availability. That work has been undertaken by the University of Tennessee Knoxville, so maybe they can provide more information.<div>

Hi,
<div><br></div><div>I&#39;d like to know if there is a way to checkpoint a specific process running under an mpirun call. In other words, is there a function CHECKPOINT(rank) in which I can pass the rank of the process I want to checkpoint? I do not want to checkpoint the entire application, but just one of its processes.</div>

<div><br></div><div>Thanks</div>
