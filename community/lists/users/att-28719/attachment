According to the OpenMPI FAQ:<br>
<br>
'You may want to alter other parameters, but the important one is &quot;control_slaves&quot;, specifying that the environment has &quot;tight integration&quot;. Note also the lack of a start or stop procedure. The tight integration means that mpirun automatically picks up the
 slot count to use as a default in place of the '-np' argument, picks up a host file, spawns remote processes via 'qrsh' so that SGE can control and monitor them, and creates and destroys a per-job temporary directory ($TMPDIR), in which Open MPI's directory
 will be created (by default).'<br>
<br>
When I look at my OpenMPI environment there is no $TMPDIR environment variable.<br>
<br>
How does OpenMPI determine where it's going to put the &quot;per-job temporary directory ($TMPDIR)&quot;? Does it use an SoGE defined environment variable? Is the host file used by OpenMPI spawned in this $TMPDIR temporary directory?<br>
