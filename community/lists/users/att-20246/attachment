<html><body><div style="color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:verdana, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt">Hello,<br><br>I believe my understanding of MPI_Probe is not correct. Here's what I have as a setup:<br><br>Two MPI processes, A and B. Process A sends a large message, M1 using tag T1, and a small message, M2 using tag T2. The recepient of both messages is B.<br><br>The order of sending the messages is M1 and then M2.<br><br>The process B however executes MPI_Probe to test if the message with tag T2 is available. B will accept M1 after it has received M2 first.<br><br>I am under the impression that using information gained from MPI_Probe, I can choose not to receive message M1, and instead look for M2.<br><br>However, I see that M2 is never received by B (although A confirms that both M1 and M2 have been sent).<br><br>I am little confused. Can someone explain why B cannot receive M2? At least, does MPI allow receiving messages in the
 order that I have just described?<br><br>Thanks a lot.<br><br>Devendra Rai.<br><div><br></div></div></body></html>
