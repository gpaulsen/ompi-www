The approach just doesn’t scale very well. Once the graduate student who wrote it received his degree, there simply wasn’t enough user-level interest to motivate the developer members to maintain it.</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">In the interim, we’ve seen considerable interest in application-level CR in its place. You might checkout the SCR library from LLNL as an example of what people are doing in that space:</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class=""><a href="https://computation.llnl.gov/project/scr/" class="">https://computation.llnl.gov/project/scr/</a></div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">We did have someone (another graduate student) recently work with the community to attempt to restore the binary-level CR support, but he didn’t get a chance to complete it prior to graduating. So we are removing the leftover code from the 2.x release series until someone comes along with enough interest to repair it.</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">Assuming that hasn’t happened before sometime next year, I might take a shot at it then - but I won’t have any time to work on it before next spring at the earliest, and as I said, it isn’t clear there is a significant user base for binary-level CR with the shift to application-level systems.</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">HTH</div><div class="">Ralph</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class=""><br class=""><div><blockquote type="cite" class=""><div class="">On Sep 18, 2015, at 8:14 AM, Dave Love &lt;<a href="mailto:d.love@liverpool.ac.uk" class="">d.love@liverpool.ac.uk</a>&gt; wrote:</div><br class="Apple-interchange-newline"><div class="">"<a href="mailto:gzzhang@buaa.edu.cn" class="">gzzhang@buaa.edu.cn</a>" &lt;<a href="mailto:gzzhang@buaa.edu.cn" class="">gzzhang@buaa.edu.cn</a>&gt; writes:<br class=""><br class=""><blockquote type="cite" class="">Hi Team <br class="">I am trying to use the MPI to do some test and study on the C/R<br class="">enabled debugging. &nbsp;Professor Josh Hursey said that the feature never<br class="">made it into a release so it was only ever available on the trunk,<br class="">However , since that time the C/R functionality has fallen into<br class="">disrepair.
