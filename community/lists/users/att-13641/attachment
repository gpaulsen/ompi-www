<div>I observe that when the data size and the number of processes increases, the runtime of BLCR is very small compared to the overall checkpoint overhead in Open MPI. Is it because of the increase of coordination time for checkpoint? And what is included in the overall checkpoint overhead besides the BLCR&#39;s checkpoint overhead and coordination time?</div>
