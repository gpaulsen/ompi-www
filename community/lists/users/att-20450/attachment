--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>A daemon (pid unknown) died unexpectedly on signal 1  while attempting to<br>launch so we are aborting.<br><br>There may be more information reported by the environment (see above).<br>
<br>This may be because the daemon was unable to find all the needed shared<br>libraries on the remote node. You may set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to have the<br>location of the shared libraries on the remote nodes and this will<br>
automatically be forwarded to the remote nodes.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>mpirun noticed that the job aborted, but has no info as to the process<br>
that caused that situation.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>mpirun: clean termination accomplished<br><br><br>Any debugging procedure  with openmpi and slurm?<br><br>Thanks<br>
