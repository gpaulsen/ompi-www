Dear Reiner, Jeff, Gus and list,<br>
<br>
Thanks for your suggestions, I will test them tomorrow. <br>
<br>
I did not check your mails before because I was busy trying the
gcc/gfortran way. <br>
I have other problems:<br>
- for static linking I am missing plenty of ibv_* routines. I saw on
the net that they should be in a libibverbs library, but I cannot find
it.<br>
- dynamic linking is OK, but when I test a simple test program on my
machine (i7 920) with an mpd-hosts containing a single line with the
name of the machine and slots=4, the program only execute provided I
give my password, allthough I do have a .rhosts file with the name of
my machine in my home directory.<br>
