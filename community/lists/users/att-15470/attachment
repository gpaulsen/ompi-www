It is necessary &nbsp;to have some means of path management to ensure that applications build against the desired version of openmpi and run with the version of openmpi they were built with. We use the module system for this path management. We create modules for each version of openmpi and each version of the applications. We than include the appropriate openmpi module in the module for the application. Then when a user loads a module for their application they automatically get the correct version of openmpi.</div><div><br></div><div>Doug Reeder<br><div><div>On Feb 1, 2011, at 2:02 PM, Jeffrey A Cummings wrote:</div><br class="Apple-interchange-newline"><blockquote type="cite"><font size="2" face="sans-serif">I use OpenMPI on a variety of platforms:

1.3 OpenMPI stream. &nbsp;I recently requested an upgrade on all systems
to 1.4.3 (for production work) and 1.5.1 (for experimentation). &nbsp;I'm
getting a lot of push back from the SysAdmin folks claiming that OpenMPI
is closely intertwined with the specific version of the operating system
and/or other system software (i.e., Rocks on the clusters). &nbsp;I need
to know if they are telling me the truth or if they're just making excuses
to avoid the work. &nbsp;To state my question another way: &nbsp;Apparently
each release of Linux and/or Rocks comes with some version of OpenMPI bundled
in. &nbsp;Is it dangerous in some way to upgrade to a newer version of
OpenMPI? &nbsp;Thanks in advance for any insight anyone can provide.</font>
