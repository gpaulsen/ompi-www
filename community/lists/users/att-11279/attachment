Hi,<br><br>I tried to execute OpenMPI examples from OFED-1.4 stack and found that all those<br>examples uses IPoIB.<br><br>Is there any way to execute MPI applications on only Infiniband stack i.e. without<br>using IPoIB module ?<br>
Can we execute MPI applications using libibverbs, librdma, or some other libraries ?<br><br><br>Thanks,<br>Vivek<br>
