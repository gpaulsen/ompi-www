    Hello,<br>
    <br>
    I really like Open-MPI and its Modular Component Architecture.<br>
    The --mca parameters are so useful for learning and testing things !<br>
    <br>
    So here are my questions.<br>
    <br>
    I know that the default point-to-point messaging layer is ob1<br>
    (the
    <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;
      charset=ISO-8859-1">
    Obi-Wan Kenobi PML). I know that there is also the PML<br>
    cm (the Connor MacLeod PML).<br>
    <br>
    From what I understand, the force is strong with Obi-Wan Kenobi, so
    he<br>
    can use various byte transfer layers (BTLs).<br>
    And there can be only one highlander (probably Connor MacLeod) so<br>
    when I use the MTL psm, I can not use any of the BTLs because Connor<br>
    MacLeod can only be alone at the end.<br>
    <br>
    But what about the PML csum ?<br>
    <br>
    What exactly is the PML csum (checksum) doing ?<br>
    <br>
    Which code is the PML csum using for actually transferring stuff
    between<br>
    MPI ranks ? BTLs or MTLs or something else or nothing ?<br>
    <br>
    I have searched the web a little but have not found much about it.<br>
    <br>
    If I use the MTL psm, can the PML csum be used to detect message<br>
    corruption ? I guess the answer is no because csum is not Connor
    MacLeod.<br>
    <br>
    I have read that when the MTL psm is used, all the Open-MPI BTL
    objects are<br>
    disabled.<br>
    <br>
    What code would the PML dr use to move bytes around should it<br>
    be stable and production-ready ?<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    And my final question:<br>
    <br>
    When a company design a new interconnect, why choose the MTL
    architecture<br>
    (and thus the PML cm) instead of the BTL architecture (with the ob1
    PML) ?<br>
    <br>
    It seems to me that ob1 and BTLs are mature and that BTLs self and
    sm are quite<br>
    useful and bug-free for what I know. New code should only do the
    case when the two<br>
    MPI processes are on different nodes, right ?<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Thank you !<br>
    <br>
