<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>hi everybody,</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>i'm new on this list and started using OpenMPI for 
my parallel jobs. first step was to measure the latency for blocking 
communication functions. now&nbsp;my first question: is it possible 
that&nbsp;ordained communication pairs&nbsp;will be&nbsp;optimized?</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>background:</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>latency for special processnumbers&nbsp;is nearly 
25% smaller, e.g. for process 1,2,4,8,16,32,64... (every computer scientist 
should see the pattern ;-)). it doesn't matter from which process i send the 
message if the receiver is one of&nbsp;these processes i have top latency 
values. it's not possible that this effect comes through the network because 
communication from proc5 to proc32 e.g. is faster than communication from proc32 
to proc5. </FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2>i've tried it with OpenMPI for Intel 
1.1.4 and 1.2.2 and OpenMPI for PGI 1.2.2. always the same results. now i think 
it must be a kind of optimization. if it's so i would like to know it because 
then i have an explanation ;-).</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>thx and regards,</FONT></DIV>
