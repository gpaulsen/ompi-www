Subject: [OMPI users] mpirun links wrong library with BLACS tester<BR>
<BR>
I have installed openmpi 1.4.1 locally for one user on a cluster,&nbsp;<BR>
where some other mpi were installed.<BR>
<BR>
when I try to run an executable through mpirun (I am running the BLACS&nbsp;<BR>
tester) I get<BR>
xFbtest_MPI-LINUX-0: error while loading shared libraries: liblam.so.<BR>
0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory<BR>
<BR>
if I run the executable it works<BR>
ldd always shows the correct libraries (even when run in mpirun) and&nbsp;<BR>
no liblam<BR>
also the environment looks normal in both cases (both PATH and&nbsp;<BR>
LD_RUN_PATH have the installation as first path).<BR>
I did try to&nbsp; set -rpath to */lib and */lib/openmpi, and generally&nbsp;<BR>
reduce the environment to a basic one, and use that in all the shells&nbsp;<BR>
both when compiling and running, but to no avail.<BR>
The examples in the openmpi directory seem to work without problems.<BR>
I did manage to run the blacs tester, but in no reproducible way (I&nbsp;<BR>
really don't know what I did to make it work and it stopped working&nbsp;<BR>
really fast (the same binary)).<BR>
The same setup works in another machine (and I think BLACS flags are ok)<BR>
<BR>
I am getting really crazy, any pointer at what else I could try would&nbsp;<BR>
be greatly appreciated.<BR>
