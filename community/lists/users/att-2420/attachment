<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Hi, Gary-</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>This looks like a config problem, and not a code 
problem yet.&nbsp; Could you send the output of mx_info from node-1 and from 
node-2?&nbsp; Also, forgive me counter-asking a possibly dumb OMPI question, but 
is "-x LD_LIBRARY_PATH" really what you want, as opposed to "-x 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}" ?&nbsp; (I would not be surprised if not 
specifying a value defaults to this behavior, but have to ask).</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Also, have you tried MX MTL as opposed to 
BTL?&nbsp; --mca pml cm --mca mtl mx,self&nbsp; (it looks like you 
did)</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>"[node-2:10464] mx_connect fail for node-2:0 with 
key aaaaffff " makes it look like your fabric may not be fully mapped or that 
you may have a down link.</FONT></DIV>

  <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I was initially using 1.1.2 and moved to 1.2b2 
  because of a hang on MPI_Bcast() which 1.2b2 reports to fix, and seemed to 
  have done so. My compute nodes are 2 dual core xeons on myrinet with mx. The 
  problem is trying to get ompi running on mx only. My machine file is as 
  follows …</FONT></P>

  <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>I don't believe there'a anything wrong w/ the 
  hardware as I can ping on mx between this failed node and the master fine. So 
  I tried a different set of 3 nodes and I got the same error, it always fails 
  on the 2nd node of any group of nodes I 
choose.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BODY></HTML>
