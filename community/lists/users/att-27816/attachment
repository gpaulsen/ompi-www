<div dir="ltr">Hi Everyone!<br><br>I would like to understand how the checkpoint tools work on OpenMPI, like BLCR and DMTCP. I would be glad if you could me answer the following questions:<br><br>1) BLCR and DMTCP take checkpoints on the parallel processes. The checkpoints are taken on a coordinated way? I mean, there is a synchronization among the processes in order to reach a consistent global state?<br><br>2) If there is a coordinated checkpoint, is the OpenMPI responsible to do that?<br><br>3) There is a way to tell to OpenMPI just to take uncoordinated checkpoints, not in a coordinated way?<br><br>4) Where can I find a documentation about how to configure these tools on OpenMPI.<br><br>Thank you very much!<br><br>Edson<br><br></div>
