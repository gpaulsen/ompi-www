&gt;&gt; &gt; My understanding/assumption is, Infiniband also work without using<br>

&gt;&gt; &gt; IPoIB module.  All the traffic generated by such xyz application<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; should go to remote machine without IPoIB so for achieving this I can<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; use LID/GID of IB devices.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; These programs are written with Infiniband in mind and do not use<br>

&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; Exactly.. I am looking for these sample programs.<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
</div>Look for ibstat and ibhosts. They should be in the OFED packages somewhere.<br>
<br>
Linpack is also widely available and frequently used.<br>
<div class="im"><br>
&gt; Ok. OFED-1.4 has few sample programs in libibverbs-1.1.2 package. But<br>
&gt; all those programs expect IP address of remote machine. So those are not<br>

&gt; point me to sample applications/programs which uses purely ibverbs APIs ?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; And why those examples in libibverbs-1.1.2 package takes IP address ?<br>
&gt; Do you have any idea about that ?<br>
<br>
</div>Why not?<br>
<br>
I think hostnames and ips were used because they uniquely identify a<br>
node. Why create a parallel naming scheme? It just adds more data to<br>
track.<br>
<br></blockquote><div>I agree with this that why there should be parallel naming scheme. But <br>Infiniband devices already have LID and GID naming system to identify devices<br>So instead of using IP address to uniquely identify, we can use those LID/GID.<br>
Am I right ?<br></div><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;">
Basically, some programs are both IB and IP capable. The interface is<br>
a choice. IB/iverb capable application look for /etc/mv2.conf for<br>
interface definition. Most will quietly fallback to ethernet if they<br>
cannot detect IB devices (nice feature ehh. when in doubt just run).<br>
<br>
Some mpi implementations allow the user to specify the interface:<br>
<br>
mpiexec -np n -use-interface-something-something ib<br>
.-no-fallback-or-something /prog<br>
<br>
Then the application will print error messages instead of using IP. I<br>
don&#39;t recall if mvapich is one of these.<br>
<div class="im"><br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; My this assumption can be wrong so please correct me if I am wrong ..<br>
<br>
</div>You are wrong. Read the documentation. :-)<br>
<br>
By the way... IPoIB can be quite useful for applications that don&#39;t<br>
support IB directly. Some filesystems come to mind.<br>
