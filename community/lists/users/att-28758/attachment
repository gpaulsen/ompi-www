<div dir="ltr"><div><div><div><div><div><div>Hello all<br><br></div>I am wondering as to:<br><br></div>1. Why &#39;self&#39; needs to be explicitly mentioned when using the BTL communication? Since it must always be there for MPI communication to work, should it not be implicit? I am sure there is some architectural rationale behind this; could someone please elaborate?<br><br></div>2. Why is this (using &#39;self&#39;) not needed when using MTL communication?<br><br></div>3. Is it possible to mix BTL and MTL on a single OMPI job? For example, if I have a card, let&#39;s say Texas Instruments Hyperlink, that is only available as BTL, and I also have Qlogic cards on the same nodes, can I use something like this:<br><br></div>mpirun -np 3 -H h1,h2,h3 -mca MTL psm -mca BTL self,hlink<br><br></div>4. If the above answer is yes, then would OpenMPI use both cards *simultaneously* (and stripe messages) or would it use the one with higher exclusivity and put the other as standby for failure recovery?<br><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><br></div><div>Thanks in advance<br></div><div>Durga<br></div><div><br clear="all"><div><div class="gmail_signature">Life is complex.
