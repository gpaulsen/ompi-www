<div>Thanking you all very much for the reply.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I would request to have some reference about what Tim Prince  &amp; Andreas has said.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Tim said that OpenMPI has had effective shared memory message passing. Is that anything to do with --enable-MPI-threads switch while installing OpeMPI?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>regards,</div>
