Hi,<br>I have written an parallel program and when i run my program on 4,8,16 nodes and calculated the execution time at master using MPI_Wtime in master node. The problem the execution time is increasing rapidly like NON parallel program-55 sec, and for parallel program 2-nodes--60sec , 4-nodes 74sec, 8-node--120 sec and for 16 nodes---for 180 sec. can i know my problem in parallel version actually the time needs to be decreased but it is increasing i dont the reason. i have calculated my time as shown below<br>
<br><br>main(argv,argc)<br>{<br>double start,end;<br>start=  MPI_Wtime;<br>// done some work<br>{<br>// start send from master node and receiving it<br>end =MPI_Wtime;<br>cout&lt;&lt;&quot;execution time&quot;&lt;&lt;end-start;<br>
}<br>//in slave nodes done some work<br> MPI_Finalize;<br>}<br><br>Please help me in solving this problem.<br clear="all"><br>-- <br> WITH REGARDS<br>M.L.N.Seshendra<br>
