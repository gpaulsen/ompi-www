Hi there!<div><br></div><div>In my code I use MPI_Comm_accept in a server-client communication. I noticed that the server remains on busy wait whereas waiting for clients connections, using 100% of CPU if there are no other processes running.</div>


<div><br></div><div>I wonder if there is any way to prevent this from happening.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks in advance.</div><div><br></div><div>Thatyene Ramos</div>
