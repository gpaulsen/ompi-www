    Hi,<br>
    <br>
    I've been running with 1.6.5 for some time and am now trying out
    1.8.8 (I'll get to 1.10 soon).<br>
    I have found a difference in behavior and I'm wondering what is
    happening.<br>
    <br>
    For special reasons, I have a host file which uses index values as
    logical names:<br>
    <blockquote>0<br>
      1<br>
      2<br>
      3<br>
    </blockquote>
    These are properly understood by the launcher. With 1.6.5, when I
    do:<br>
    <blockquote>mpirun hostname<br>
    </blockquote>
    I get 4 lines of output.<br>
    <br>
    However, when I do the same with 1.8.8 on a 16 cpu machine, I get 64
    lines of output.<br>
    <br>
    If I change my hostfile to:<br>
    <blockquote>0 slots=1<br>
      1 slots=1<br>
      2 slots=1<br>
      3 slots=1<br>
    </blockquote>
    I get only 4 lines with 1.8.8.<br>
    <br>
    Can you explain why I see the behavior I do, specifically, getting
    the 64 lines of output? Is the<br>
    interpretation of the hostfile different between 1.6.5 and 1.8.8?
    Are logical names without the<br>
    "slots=1" (now?) treated differently than hostnames?<br>
    <br>
    Thanks,<br>
    John<br>
