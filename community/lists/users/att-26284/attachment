<br>
Besides the items in the other mail, I have three more items that would need resolving at some point.<br>
<br>
1. STDOUT/STDERR currently go to the orte-dvm console.<br>
   I&#39;m sure this is not a fundamental limitation.<br>
   Even if getting the information to the orte-submit instance would be problematic, the orte-dvm writing this to a file per session would be good enough too.<br>
<br>
2. Failing applications currently tear down the dvm.<br>
   Ideally that would not be the case, and this would be handled in relation to item (3).<br>
   Possibly this needs to be configurable, if others would like to see different behaviour.<br>
<br>
3. orte-submit doesn&#39;t return the exit code of the application.<br>
<br>
To be clear, I realise the current implementation is a proof of concept, so these are no complaints, just wishes of where I hope to see this going!<br>
<br>
FWIW: these items might require less intricate knowledge of OMPI in general, so with some pointers/guidance I can probably work on these myself if needed.<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>

<br>
ps. I did a quick-and-dirty integration with our own tool and the ORTE abstraction maps like a charm!<br>

&gt;&gt; I think I fixed some of the handshake issues - please give it another try.<br>
&gt;&gt; You should see orte-submit properly shutdown upon completion,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Indeed, it works on my laptop now! Great!<br>
&gt; It feels quite fast too, for sort tasks :-)<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; and orte-dvm properly shutdown when sent the terminate cmd.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; ACK. This also works as expected.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; I was able to cleanly run MPI jobs on my laptop.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Do you also see the following errors/warnings on the dvm side?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; [netbook:28324] [[20896,0],0] Releasing job data for [INVALID]<br>
&gt; Hello, world, I am 0 of 1, (Open MPI v1.9a1, package: Open MPI mark@netbook Distribution, ident: 1.9.0a1, repo rev: dev-811-g7299cc3, Unreleased developer copy, 132)<br>
&gt; [netbook:28324] sess_dir_finalize: proc session dir does not exist<br>
&gt; [netbook:28324] [[20896,0],0] dvm: job [20896,20] has completed<br>
&gt; [netbook:28324] [[20896,0],0] Releasing job data for [20896,20]<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The &quot;INVALID&quot; message is there for every &quot;submit&quot;, the sess_dir_finalize exists per instance/core.<br>
&gt; Is that something to worry about, that needs fixing or is that a configuration issue?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I haven&#39;t been able to test on Edison because of maintenance (today+tomorrow), so I will report on that later.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Thanks again!<br>
&gt;<br>
