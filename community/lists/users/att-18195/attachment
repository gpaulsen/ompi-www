I have not tried to support a MTL with the checkpointing functionality, so I do not have first hand experience with those - just the OB1/BML/BTL stack.<div><br></div><div>The difficulty in porting to a new transport is really a function of how the transport interacts with the checkpointer (e.g., BLCR). The draining logic is handled above the PML level (in the CRCP framework), so the MTL would only have to implement a ft_event() handler. The ft_event() handler needs to (1) prepare the transport for checkpointing (the channel is know to be clear at this point, but you may have to handle registered memory and things like that), (2) continue operation after a checkpoint in the same process image, and (3) restarting the transport on recovery into a new process image (usually something like reinitializing the driver).</div>
<div><br></div><div>The easiest way to implement these is to shutdown the driver on checkpoint prep (something like a finalize function) and reinitialize it on continue/restart phases (something like an init function). Depending on the transport driver you might be able to do something better (like we do for tcp and sm), but it is really transport driver specific.</div>
