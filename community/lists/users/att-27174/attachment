          Abaqus documentation suggests that it may be possible to run
          it using an external MPI stack, and I am hoping to make it
          work with our stock openmpi/1.8.4 that knows how to talk with
          the scheduler's hwloc. Unfortunately, however, all of my
          attempts failed miserably so far (no specific instructions for
          openmpi). <br>
          <br>
          I was wondering if anyone had success with getting Abaqus
          running with openmpi. Even the information of whether it is
          possible or not will help us a great deal.

    Data types encodings are incompatible between openmpi and mpich
    derivatives, and, I think, with the HP or Platform-MPI normally used
    by past Abaqus releases.  You should be looking at Abaqus release
    notes for your version.<br>
    Comparing include files between the various MPI families should give
    you a clue about type encoding compatibility.  Lack of instructions
    for openmpi probably means something.<br>
