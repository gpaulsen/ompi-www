Hi folks,<br>  Is MPI suitable for running jobs on large clusters??<br>  Is it best suited only for SMP ?<br>  <br>  I used MPI on relatively small cluster.<br>  <br>  But now i have to recommend&nbsp; MPI for a relatively large 600 node cluster. Shall I ??<br>  <br>  The nature of jobs is well, processing tera bytes of data.<br>  <br>  Thanks in advance<br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  Imran<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <p>&#32;
