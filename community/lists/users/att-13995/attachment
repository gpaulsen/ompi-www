    Hello OpenMPI,<br>
    <br>
    we have deployed OpenMPI 1.4.1 and 1.4.2 on our Intel Nehalem
    cluster using Intel compilers V 11.1.059 and 11.1.072 respectively,
    and one user has the following request:<br>
    <br>
    Can we build OpenMPI version say O.1 against Intel compilers version
    say I.1 but&nbsp; then built an application with OpenMPI O.1 BUT then use
    a DIFFERENT Intel compiler version say I.2 to built and run this MPI
    application?<br>
    <br>
    I suggested to him to 1) simply try to built and run the application
    with O.1 but use Intel compilers version I.X whatever this X is and
    see if it has any issues. <br>
    <br>
    OR 2) If the above does not work, I would build OpenMPI O.1 against
    Intel version I.X so he can use THIS combination for his
    hypothetical application. <br>
    <br>
    He insists that I build OpenMPI O.1 with some version of Intel
    compilers I.Y but then at run time he would like to use <b>different</b>
    Intel run time libs at will I.Z &lt;&gt; I.X. <br>
    <br>
    Can you provide me with a suggestion for a sane solution to this ? <span class="moz-smiley-s1"><span> :-) </span></span><br>
    <br>
    Best regards<br>
    <br>
