<br>Hello,<br>  Could you pl tell me how to connect a client(not in any mpi group )  to a<br>
    process in a mpi group.<br>
    (i.e.  just like we do in socket programming by using connect( ) call).<br>
   Does mpi provide any call for accepting connections from outside<br>
    processes?<br clear="all"><br>-- <br>Regards <br>Mahesh<br>
