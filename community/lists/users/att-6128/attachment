Dear all,<br><br>I have enjoyed the openmpi a couple of days. With the help of openmpi I could run ESPRESSO efficiently.<br><br>I started the mpi-job by the openmpi command like this,<br><br>" nohup mpirun -hostfile ~/hostfile -np 64 pw.x &lt; input &gt; output &amp;".<br><br>When I want to stop the job before it finished, I find it not easy to stop all the process manually. When I killed the process<br>in one node of the cluster, the processes in other nodes were still running. So I must ssh to every node, find the <br>process id and kill the process. If there are 100 processors or more for one mpi job, the situation even worse.<br><br>Is there a command for openmpi to force all the process to stop in the cluster or a list of nodes to stop.&nbsp; <br><br>vega<br><br><font size="4"><span style="font-family: Lucida Handwriting,Cursive;">Vega Lew</span></font> £¨weijia liu)<br>PH.D Candidate in Chemical Engineering<br>
