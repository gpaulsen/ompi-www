      <div>I've been running this in my head all day - it just doesn't
        fit experience, which really bothered me. So I spent a little
        time running the calculation, and I came up with a number much
        lower (more like around 5%). I'm not saying my rough number is
        correct, but it is at least a little closer to what we see in
        the field.</div>

      <div>Given that there are a lot of assumptions required when doing
        these calculations, I would like to suggest you conduct a very
        simply and quick experiment before investing tons of time on FT
        solutions. All you have to do is:</div>

    Thanks for the calculation. However, this is a cluster that I
    manage, I do not use it per say, and running such statistical jobs
    on a large part of the cluster for a long period of time is
    impossible. We do have the numbers however. The cluster has 960
    nodes. We experience roughly one power or cooling failure per month
    or two months. Assuming one such failure per two months, if you run
    for 1 month, you have a 50% chance your job will be killed before it
    ends. If you run for 2 weeks, 25%, etc. These are very rough
    estimates obviously, but it is way more than 5%.<br>
    <br>
    In addition to that, we have a failure rate of ~0.1%/day, meaning
    that out of 960, on average, one node will have a hardware failure
    every day. Most of the time, this is a failure of one of the dimms.
    Considering each node has 12 dimms of 2GB of memory, it means a dimm
    failure rate of ~0.0001 per day. I don't know if that's bad or not,
    but this is roughly what we have.<br>

      <div>If it turns out you see power failure problems, then a
        simple, low-cost, ride-thru power stabilizer might be a good
        solution. Flywheels and capacitor-based systems can provide
        support for momentary power quality issues at reasonably low
        costs for a cluster of your size.</div>
    </blockquote>
    I doubt there is anything low cost for a 330 kW system, and in any
    case, hardware upgrade is not an option since this a mid-life
    cluster. Again, as I said, the filesystem (2 x 500 TB lustre
    partitions) and the management nodes are on UPS, but there is no way
    to put the compute nodes on UPS.<br>

      <div>If your node hardware is the problem, or you decide you do
        want/need to pursue an FT solution, then you might look at the
        OMPI-based solutions from parties such as <a
          moz-do-not-send="true" href="http://fault-tolerance.org">http://fault-tolerance.org</a>
        or the MPICH2 folks.</div>

    Thanks for the tip.<br>
