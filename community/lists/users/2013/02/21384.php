<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt; The Intel+PPC is one issue.  However, even on Intel, there tends to be a

<span class="quotelev1">&gt; distinction between Intel environments going from Xeon to Core iX
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; environments. While Objective-C/C/C++ handle this well, the Fortran
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; compilers have given me a different story over the years.  It tends to be
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; the case that not all of the 64 bit compilations are not the same,
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; especially with the Fortran compilers.  
</span><br>
<p>I don't know if there are any Fortran compilers who create OS X universal binaries.
<br>
<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt; The second issue of the host files has to do with a defunct capability for
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; example Xgrid.  It used to be that various Xgrid sites were reasonable
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; sources of information with regards to MPI and one could get the recipes to
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; equip either a cluster or grid environment.  Examples included TenGrid
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; (http:/tengrid.com) , MacResearch ( <a href="http://www.macresearch.org">http://www.macresearch.org</a>), etc.  
</span><br>
<p>I'm still not sure what you're asking here -- Xgrid is long dead.
<br>
<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt; I hope that the new amount of data being collected at the open MPI site will
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; facilitate both the mobile and data center variety of MPI alike.  
</span><br>
<p>What data collection are you referring to?
<br>
<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt; The beauty
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; of mobility is the feature that the Mac, Windows, and potentially iOS, and
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; Andriod platforms bring to the concept of MPI.  The cost is keeping track of
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; when such devices come and go from such grids.
</span><br>
<p>People have experimented with trying to do parallel computing on mobile devices, but power has always been a problem.
<br>
<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt; I may had a misarticulated question with regards to the marshaling
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; capabilities of MPI.  It may have improved since I last used MPI.  I know
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; that there are standards bodies for MPI itself.  Therefore, I will need to
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; check to see what changes have occurred.
</span><br>
<p><p>MPI has datatypes, but they're not really the same thing as traditional marshaling/dynamic serializing.
