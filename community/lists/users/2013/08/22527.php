Thanks, Jeff, for the info and suggestion.
<br>
<p>I know of no web site where I could post the compressed files.  I tried to
<br>
create a blog at <a href="http://www.blogger.com/home">http://www.blogger.com/home</a> to post the info, but it does
<br>
not seem to take compressed-file uploads.  I then tried copying text to the
<br>
blog and the screen went &quot;Aw snap!&quot;.  So it looks like that resource will
<br>
not be much help either.
<br>
