<br>
<p>In addition to the main conference's technical program, EuroMPI/ASIA
<br>
2014 is soliciting proposals for one-day or half-day workshops to be
<br>
held in conjunction with the main conference.  It is intended that
<br>
those workshops are aim to discuss on ongoing work and latest ideas
<br>
related to applications with message passing paradigms.
<br>
The Call for Papers will be separately announced and also shown in the
<br>
conference page.
<br>
<p><p>BACKGROUND AND TOPICS
<br>
---------------------
<br>
EuroMPI is the preeminent meeting for users, developers and
<br>
researchers to interact and discuss new developments and applications
<br>
of message-passing parallel computing, in particular in and related to
<br>
the Message Passing Interface (MPI). The annual meeting has a long,
<br>
rich tradition, and has been held in European countries.  In the 21st
<br>
EuroMPI, the conference venue is at Kyoto, Japan, outside of Europe.
<br>
&nbsp;Following past meetings, EuroMPI/ASIA 2014 will continue to focus
<br>
on not just MPI, but also extensions or alternative interfaces for
<br>
high-performance homogeneous/heterogeneous/hybrid systems, benchmarks,
<br>
tools, parallel I/O, fault tolerance, and parallel applications using
<br>
MPI and other interfaces.  Through the presentation of contributed
<br>
papers, poster presentations and invited talks, attendees will have
<br>
the opportunity to share ideas and experiences to contribute to the
<br>
improvement and furthering of message-passing and related parallel
<br>
programming paradigms.
