hi,<br><br>i was wondering if it&#39;s possible to simultaneous set the mca parameters for both the coordinated checkpoint and the vprototocol at the same time like this:<br><br>mpirun -n 10 -am ft-enable-cr -mca vprotocol pessimist -mca crs blcr prog<br>
<br>i have tried, but it seems that the vprotocol does not work with ft-enable-cr. is there a way to overcome this?<br><br><br>thank you.<br><br><br>
