<div dir="ltr"><br>Hello,<br><div>We are trying port MPICH to a new operating system, called EPOS, but our main problem at the moment is that this operating system is not POSIX compatible. </div><div>Our question is there some way to know what are the OS dependencies of Open MPI? </div>

<div>Is there a porting manual of Open MPI?</div><div>Is there a documentation for ORTE and OPAL?</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks.</div></div>
