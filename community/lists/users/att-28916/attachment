I have been looking into the MPI-3 extensions that added ways to do direct memory copying on multi-core &#39;nodes&#39; that share memory. Architectures constructed from these nodes are universal now, so improved ways to exploit them are certainly needed.  However, it is my understanding that Open-MPI and other widely used MPI implementations, e.g. Intel, MPICH, use hardware locality to identify shared memory regions and do direct memory copies between processes in these cases, rather than network communication.  If this is the case, are there any additional advantages from explicit programming of memory copying using MPI-3 shared memory features?<br>
