<br>I developed a small program to explain my problem as can be seen in attachment.<br>-- start.c: launches (through MPI_Comm_spawn, in which the argv has the level value) the root of the tree (a ch_rec program). Afterward spawn, a message is sent to&nbsp; child and the process block in an MPI_Recv.<br>

-- ch_rec.c: gets its level value and receives the parent message, then if its level is less than a predefined limit, it will creates 2 children: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - set the level value;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - spawn 1 child;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - send a message;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - call an MPI_Irecv;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - repeat the 4 previous steps for the second child;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - call an MPI_Waitany waiting for children returns.<br>When children messages are received, the process send a message to its parent and call MPI_Finalize.<br>

<br>Using the openmpi-1.3.3 version the program runs as expected but with openmpi-1.4 I get the following error:<br><br>$ mpirun -np 1 start<br>level 0<br>level = 1<br>Parent sent: level 0 (pid:4279)<br>level = 2<br>Parent sent: level 1 (pid:4281)<br>

In my tests I try to put an sleep of 2 second between the first and the second spawn, and then the program runs as expected.<br><br>Some one can help me with this version 1.4 bug? <br><br>thanks,<br>márcia.<br><br>
