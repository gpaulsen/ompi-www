Hi, I know that I have to include some information to get the<br>right answer. But, I have one simple question which does not<br>need that information.<br><br>1. I could not find any document except FAQ and mailing list<br>
for Open MPI. Is there any user manual or something like that?<br>Or, the LAM MPI's manual can be used instead?<br><br>2. Another question is about installation.<br>If I want to use rsh/ssh for Open MPI, do I have to install
<br>Open MPI on all master and slave nodes? Or, should I use<br>something like NSF file system so that even though I installed<br>Open MPI on only master node, all the other salve nodes could<br>see Open MPI installation in the master node?
<br><br>The error I have is from I wanted to run a program on two slave<br>nodes but shell complained that there is no orted. It is true<br>that there is no installation of Open MPI on each slave node.<br><br>Thank you,<br>
<br>Sang Chul<br><br>P.S. The Errors when I ran the command line<br><br>% mpirun --hostfile hostfile -np 2 hello<br><br>=============================================<br>bash: line 1: orted: command not found<br>[node00:04841] ERROR: A daemon on node node02 failed to start as expected.
