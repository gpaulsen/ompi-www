It sounds like perhaps IOF messages aren&#39;t getting relayed along the daemons. Note that the daemon on each node does have to be able to send TCP messages to all other nodes, not just mpirun.<br>
<br>
Couple of things you can do to check:<br>
<br>
1. -mca routed direct - this will send all messages direct instead of across the daemons<br>
<br>
2. --leave-session-attached - will allow you to see any errors reported by the daemons, including those from attempting to relay messages<br>

<br>
With<br>
-mca routed direct<br>
it works correctly.<br>
<br>
With this:<br>
mpirun -H 10.1.2.126,10.1.2.122,10.1.2.123,10.1.2.125 --leave-session-attached -np 4 /home/doriad/MPITest/hello-mpi<br>
<br>
I still get no output nor errors from the daemons.<br><br>Is there a downside
to using &#39;mca routed direct&#39;? Or should I fix whatever is causing this
daemon issue? You have any other tests for me to try to see what&#39;s
wrong?<br>
