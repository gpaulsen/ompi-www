Hi,<br><br>I wanted to try the C/R feature in OpenMPI version 1.4.1 that I have downloaded today. When I want to checkpoint I am having the following error message:<br><span style="font-family: courier new,monospace;" class="quotelev3">[[65192,0],0] ORTE_ERROR_LOG: Not found in file orte-checkpoint.c at line 399</span><br style="font-family: courier new,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: courier new,monospace;" class="quotelev3">HNP with PID 2337 Not found!
</span><br><br>I tried the same thing with version 1.3.3 and it works perfectly.<br><br>Any idea why?<br><br>thanks,<br>Andreea<br>
