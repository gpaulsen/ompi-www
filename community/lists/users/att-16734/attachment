    Dear all,<br>
    <br>
    First of all, all my apologies because I post this message to both
    the bug and user mailing list. But for the moment, I do not know if
    it is a bug!<br>
    <br>
    I am running a CFD structured flow solver at ORNL, and I have an
    access to a small cluster (Smoky) using OpenMPI-1.4.2 with
    Infiniband by default. Recently we increased the size of our models,
    and since that time we have run into many infiniband related
    problems.&nbsp; The most serious problem is a hard crash with the
    following error message:<br>
    <br>
    <tt><big><font size="1"><big>[</big></font><i><font size="1"><big>smoky45][[60998,1],32][/sw/sources/ompi/1.4.2/ompi/mca/btl/<span
                class="il">openib</span>/connect/btl_openib_connect_oob.c:464:qp_create_one]
              error creating qp errno says Cannot allocate memory</big></font></i></big></tt><br>
    <br>
    If we force the solver to use ethernet (<tt>mpirun -mca btl ^openib</tt>)
    the computations works correctly, although very slowly (a single
    iteration take ages). Do you have any idea what could be causing
    these problems?<br>
    <br>
    If it is due to a bug or a limitation into OpenMPI, do you think the
    version 1.4.3, the coming 1.4.4 or any 1.5 version could solve the
    problem? I read the release notes, but I did not read any obvious
    patch which could fix my problem. The system administrator is ready
    to compile a new package for us, but I do not want to ask to install
    to many of them. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    Thanks.
