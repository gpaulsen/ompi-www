So, it appears that for a machine of this type (dual quad core cpu's),
this approach would be correct for my tests...<br>
<br>
[jpummill@n1 bin]$ more my-hosts<br>
n1 slots=8 max_slots=8<br>
<br>
and subsequently, launch two jobs in this configuration...<br>
/home/jpummill/openmpi-1.2.2/bin/mpirun --hostfile my-hosts -np 4
--byslot ./cg.C.4<br>
<br>
It appears that this does avoid oversubscribing any particular core as
I am not exceeding my core count by running just the two jobs requiring
4 cores each.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

Typically, this would be done with a parameter like -machinefile
machines, but I have no idea what names to put into the machines file
as this is a single node with two quad core cpu's. As I am launching
the jobs sans scheduler, I need to specify what cores to run on I would
think to keep from overscheduling some cores while others receive
nothing to do at all.

Simple suggestions? Maybe Open MPI takes care of this detail for me?

Thanks!
