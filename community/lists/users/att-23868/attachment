<div dir="ltr"><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div>Hello,<br><br></div>I am studying the optimization strategy when the number of communication functions in a code<br></div>is high.<br><br></div>My courses on MPI say two things for optimization which are contradictory :<br>
<br></div>1*) You have to use temporary message copy to allow non-blocking sending and uncouple the sending and receiving<br><br></div>2*) Avoid using temporary message copy because the copy will add extra cost on execution time. <br>
<br></div>And then, we are adviced to do : <br><br>- replace MPI_SEND by MPI_SSEND (synchroneous blocking sending) : it is said that execution is divided by a factor 2<br><br></div>- use MPI_ISSEND and MPI_IRECV with MPI_WAIT function to synchronize (synchroneous non-blocking sending) : it is said that execution is divided by a factor 3<br>
<br></div>So what&#39;s the best optimization ? Do we have to use temporary message copy or not and if yes, what&#39;s the case for ?<br><div><br>Thanks<br></div></div>
