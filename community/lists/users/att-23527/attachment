&gt; Good evening<br>
&gt; Is there any documentation describing the difference in MPI-level implementation of the eager and rendezvous protocols in OpenIB BTL versus TCP BTL ?<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, there is not, sorry.  Just the code.  :-\<br>
<br>
&gt; I am only aware of the following paper. While this presents an excellent overview of how RDMA capabilities of modern interconnects can be leveraged for implementing these protocols, I was hoping to understand how OpenMPI implications of handling these protocols using traditional TCP.<br>

<br>
The easiest way to think about it is that the TCP BTL could well be implemented with just the &quot;send&quot; method (and no &quot;get&quot; or &quot;put&quot; methods).<br>
<br>
That being said, the TCP BTL does emulate the &quot;put&quot; method (meaning: there&#39;s obviously no hardware support for a direct data placement using a general socket in TCP like there is with OpenFabrics-style RDMA) simply because it allows us to be slightly more efficient on the receiver (IIRC; it&#39;s been a loooong time since I&#39;ve looked at that code).<br>
