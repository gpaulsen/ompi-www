What version of OMPI are you using? The job should terminate in either 
case - what did you do to keep it running after node failure with tcp?

</p><span>&gt;&gt; Hi,
</span><br>
<span>&gt;</span><span>&gt; I want to know if anybody is having 
problems with fault tolerant job using infiniband. When I run my job 
with tcp if anything happens with one node, my job keeps running, but if
 I change my job to use infiniband if anything happens with the 
infiniband (i.e cable problems) my job fails.

<span>&gt;</span><span>&gt; Anybody knows if there is something different that need to be done when using openib instead tcp?

<span>&gt;</span><span>&gt; Bellow a example of the message I'm receiving from the mpi.
