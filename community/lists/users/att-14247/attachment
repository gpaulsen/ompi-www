Hi,<br><br>I wanna know if it exist a implementation that permit to run a single host process on the master of the cluster, that will then spawn 1 process per -np X defined thread at the host specified in the host list. The host will then act as a syncronized sender/collecter of the work done.<br>
<br>It would really be the saint-graal of the MPI implementation to me, for the use i wanna make of it.<br><br>So i wait your answer, hoping that this exist,<br><br>Mikael Lavoie<br>
