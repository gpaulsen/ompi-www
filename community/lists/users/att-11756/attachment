Hei there<br><br>I have some questions regarding checkpoint/restart:<br><br>1. Until recently I thought that <span style="font-family: courier new,monospace;" class="pln">ompi</span><span style="font-family: courier new,monospace;" class="pun">-</span><span class="pln"><span style="font-family: courier new,monospace;">restart</span> and </span><span style="font-family: courier new,monospace;" class="pln">ompi</span><span style="font-family: courier new,monospace;" class="pun">-</span><span style="font-family: courier new,monospace;" class="pln">restart<font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"> are used to checkpoint a process inside an MPI application. Now I reread </font></span><a href="http://www.osl.iu.edu/research/ft/ompi-cr/tools.php">this</a> and I realized that actually what it does is to checkpoint the mpirun process. Does this mean that if I run my application with multiple processes and on multiple nodes in my network the checkpoint file will contain the states of all the processes of my MPI application?<br>
<br>2. Can I restart the application on a different node? <br><br>Thanks a lot,<br>Andreea<br>
