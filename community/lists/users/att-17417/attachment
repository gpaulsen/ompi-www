<p><span>I&#39;m using version 1.4.3 and I forgot to tell that I have made a change in the orterun.c line 792:</span></p><p><span>    if (ORTE_JOB_STATE_TERMINATED != exit_state) {<br>                    exit(0); /* patch*/<br>

What version of OMPI are you using? The job should terminate in either 
case - what did you do to keep it running after node failure with tcp?

<span>&gt;</span><span>&gt; I want to know if anybody is having 
problems with fault tolerant job using infiniband. When I run my job 
with tcp if anything happens with one node, my job keeps running, but if
 I change my job to use infiniband if anything happens with the 
infiniband (i.e cable problems) my job fails.

<span>&gt;</span><span>&gt; Anybody knows if there is something different that need to be done when using openib instead tcp?
