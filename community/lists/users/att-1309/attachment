was designed in to Open MPI, but it has not been fully stress tested.&nbsp; As 
such, there is likely to still be bugs when using multiple user threads with 
MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE.</FONT></SPAN></DIV>

<DIV><SPAN class=041595110-26052006><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff size=2>fork() 
is not technically supported by the MPI standard.&nbsp; If you *need* to fork(), 
you might want to look at alternate mechanisms if you need to move between 
multiple MPI implementations because support for it is not likely to be 
portable.</FONT></SPAN></DIV>

<DIV><SPAN class=041595110-26052006><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff size=2>Within 
Open MPI, fork() will almost certainly fail&nbsp;if you use&nbsp;the OS-bypass 
networks (Myrinet, InfiniBand).&nbsp; The mechanisms that these networks use for 
high-speed/low latency are quite problematic with fork().&nbsp; If you are using 
tcp or shared memory, fork() *might* work, but this is not something that we 
have extensively tested.</FONT></SPAN></DIV><BR>

Safety<BR></FONT><BR></DIV>
  <DIV></DIV>Hi,<BR>I am a newbie to OpenMPI.<BR>Can anyone say how the support 
  for MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE is implemented in openMPI?<BR><BR>Is thread safety 
  completely provided in openMPI? or does it still has some bugs?<BR>I am 
  currently using LAM/MPI.But i need concurrent threads making MPI calls. So i 
  am planning to move to another implementation of MPI. Can i choose 
  openMPI?<BR><BR><BR>Also, is "fork"(for child preoces creation) still a no-no 
  in&nbsp; openMPI too?&nbsp; Can a child process(forked) make concurrent MPI 
  calls along with its parent ? <BR><BR><BR>
