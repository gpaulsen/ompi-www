Hello, <br><br>I&#39;m working on an mpi application that opens a glut display on each node of a small cluster for opengl rendering (each node has its own display). My current implementation scales great with mpich2, but I&#39;d like to use openmpi infiniband, which is giving me trouble.<br>
<br>I&#39;ve had some success with the -x DISPLAY=:0.0 parameter to mpirun, which will open the display on up to 2 of my nodes... any 2.  But when I attempt to run the application on 4 nodes, the display is <strong style="font-weight: normal;"><span>non-deterministic. If any open at all process 0 definately will, and sometimes process 3 along with that.  I haven&#39;t observed much behavior from process 1 or 2.  <br>
<br>My command:<br><br>mpirun -x DISPLAY=:0.0 -np 4 -hostfile ~/openmpi.hosts ./myapp<br><br>I&#39;ve tried adding the -d option with no success.<br><br>Does anyone have any suggestions or comments?  I&#39;ll certainly provide more information if required.<br>
<br>Thanks,<br>Brad<br></span></strong>
