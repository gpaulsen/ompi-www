 want to know how many ports each process is accessing (reading as well as writing). <br></div><div><br></div><div>Basically, at the heart of it, is the scalability of our application. <br></div><div><br></div><div>Well, I think there must be plenty of people who would have dealt with the same question.</div><div><br></div><div>Opening up sniffers may not be possible for me, since I am expected to run MPI applications on a cluster, where I do not have privileges.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Does anyone know where to look?</div><div><br></div><div>Best</div><div><br></div><div>Devendra Rai<br></div></div></body></html>
