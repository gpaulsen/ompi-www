<p>Hi all.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just using OpenMPI for few days. I&#39;ll try to run a simple MPI 
program, the program is ProcessColors which I get from <a href="http://ci-tutor.ncsa.illinois.edu/content.php?cid=1091" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CI-Tutor</a>. I have 2 hosts, if I run the program 
separately on each one, it runs well. However, if I run it on two hosts 
using following command: <b>mpirun --host host1,host2 
--preload-binary -np 8 ProcessColors</b>. The program hangs.</p><p>When I use command <b>ps -A</b> to check running process, I 
find out that there is 4 processes running on each host. So, I think 
that there is a deadlock on my program, but why it runs well with single
 host?</p><p>All those following commands run without any problem on both machine:</p>

<ul><li>mpirun -np 8 ProcessColors</li><li>mpirun --host host1 -np 8 ProcessColors</li><li>mpirun --host host2 -np 8 ProcessColors</li></ul>Later, I found out that the problem comes when the remote host try to send message to the host which root process (process 0) is running, which is the host that I run the command. I don&#39;t know why the process is blocked at sending task.<br>



<p>Any help from you is precious to me.</p>

<p>Regards.</p>
