<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">Hi,</font>
<br>
<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">I am trying to use the cm component
from pml, but when I execute the command: &quot;mpirun -np 2 --mca pml
cm ompi_test&quot;, I get the error message that &quot;No available pml
components were found&quot;. I did a ompi_info to see if the cm component
exist, and it does. The output of &quot;&gt;ompi_info | grep cm&quot; was
&quot;MCA pml: cm (MCA v1.0, API v1.0, Component v1.3)&quot;. I have also
set my &nbsp;LD_LIBRARY_PATH as instructed by the FAQs. I have even reconfigured
and rebuilt open-mpi, but that didn't fix the problem either. I am wondering
whether a process on my system could interfere with opening the cm component.
I don't know the answer to this, but thought that I should throw it out
there.</font>
<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">Anyways, I am not sure what to do next
to troubleshoot this problem and was hoping that somebody could give me
pointers on what might be wrong or what I could check/do next.</font>
<br>
