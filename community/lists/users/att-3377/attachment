<br><div><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;">Using the OPEN_MPI #define is probably the safest bet to identify the<br>MPI as Open MPI, which then opens the door to using mpi&lt;compiler&gt; --
<br>showme to find the proper linker flags.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would *NOT* recommend hard-<br>coding specific flags just because you know that you&#39;re linking<br>against Open MPI (because we can/have changed the flags behind the<br>scenes).
<br></blockquote></div><br>I think one of the possible solutions would be, in the next MPI standard (will it come very soon?, or not?), specify the library (libraries) for mixed language linking. <br><br>--<br>Best regards,
