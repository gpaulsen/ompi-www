Hi.
<div><br></div><div>I am having a problem when I try to kill a spawned process. I am using ompi 1.4.3. I use the command ompi-clean to kill all the processes I have running, but those ones which were dynamically spawned are not killed.</div>
<div><br></div><div>Any idea?</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks in advance.</div>
