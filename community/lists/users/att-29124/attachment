<div dir="ltr"><div><div>Hello all<br><br></div>I run MPI jobs (for test purpose only) on two different &#39;clusters&#39;. Both &#39;clusters&#39; have two nodes only, connected back-to-back. The two are very similar, but not identical, both software and hardware wise.<br><br></div>Both have ulimit -c set to unlimited. However, only one of the two creates core files when an MPI job crashes. The other creates a text file named something like<br>&lt;program_name_that_crashed&gt;.80s-&lt;a-number-that-looks-like-a-PID&gt;,&lt;hostname-where-the-crash-happened&gt;.btr<br><div><div><div><div><br></div><div>I&#39;d much prefer a core file because that allows me to debug with a lot more options than a static text file with addresses. How do I get a core file in all situations? I am using MPI source from the master branch.<br><br></div><div>Thanks in advance<br></div><div>Durga<br></div><div><br clear="all"><div><div class="gmail_signature"><div dir="ltr"><div><div dir="ltr">The surgeon general advises you to eat right, exercise regularly and quit ageing.</div></div></div></div></div>
