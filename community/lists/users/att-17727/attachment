Hi Jeff,<br>           The file was the output to the command:<br>                           &quot;mpicc hello_cc.c -o hello_cc<br>and lists files which do not appear to be present.  I checked the permissions and they seem to be correct so I am stumped,  I did use the make and install commands and they seemed to go properly.  I have the out files for the three commands and could send them to you if you want.<br>
           Thanks for your help.<br>                                                                       Amos Leffler<br><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Mon, Nov 7, 2011 at 7:50 PM, <a href="mailto:amosleff@gmail.com">amosleff@gmail.com</a> <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:amosleff@gmail.com">amosleff@gmail.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br>
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;">Hi all,<br>        I have been trying to compile and run openmpi-1.4.4 using SUSE Linux 11.4 on VMware 7.0.1 and have run into difficulties. I used the intel compilers composerXE-2011.5.220 both C and fortran.  Both of these compilers and and openmpi-1.4.4 appeared to compiler properly since I did not see any errors in the config.out, make.out and install.out files.  However, when I tried to run the mpicc programs in the examples file it gave the output shown on the attached file.  I have tried to find the files that are listed as not found in the attached file they are not found. I have checked the file permissions and all seems to be in order.  <br>

        At this point I do not know what to do and would appreciate any advice.  <br>                                                                                                        Amos Leffler<br><br>
