<div dir="ltr">Hello,<br><br>I am trying to run the HPL benchmarking software on a new 1024 core cluster that we have set up. Unfortunately I&#39;m hitting the &quot;mca_oob_tcp_accept: accept() failed: Too many open files (24)&quot; error known in verson 1.2 of openmpi. No matter what I set the file-descriptor limit for my account to, I am still limited to only 808 or so processes. Does anyone have any suggestions?<br>
