Hi all,<div><br><div>I am using the latest version of OpenMPI (1.5.1) and BLCR (0.8.2).</div><div>I found that when running an application,which uses MPI_Isend, MPI_Irecv and MPI_Wait,  </div><div>enabling C/R, i.e using &quot;-am ft-enable-cr&quot;, the application runtime is much longer than the normal execution with mpirun (no checkpoint was taken).</div>
<div>This overhead becomes larger when the normal execution runtime is longer.</div><div>Does anybody have any idea about this overhead, and how to eliminate it?</div><div>Thanks.</div><div><br></div><div>Regards,</div><div>
Nguyen</div>
