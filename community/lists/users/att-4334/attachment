hi,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are facing some problem when calling MPI_Send over IB. The problem looks similar to ticket https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/ticket/232, but this time its for IB Interface. When forcefully running the program using --mca btl tcp,self its running fine.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Ib, its giving error messages like local protocol error, flush error, invalid request error, local length error kind of messages.<br /><br />Any help would be appreciated.<br /><br />-Neeraj<br /><br />
