Hi,<br><br>I am trying to perform an experiment in which I can spawn 2 MPI processes, one on each socket in a 4 core node<br>having 2 dual cores. I used the option  &quot;bind to socket&quot; which mpirun for that but I am getting an error like:<br>
<br>An attempt was made to bind a process to a specific hardware topology<br>mapping (e.g., binding to a socket) but the operating system does not<br>support such topology-aware actions.  Talk to your local system<br>administrator to find out if your system can support topology-aware<br>
functionality (e.g., Linux Kernels newer than v2.6.18).<br><br>Systems that do not support processor topology-aware functionality cannot<br>use &quot;bind to socket&quot; and other related functionality.<br><br><br>Can anybody please tell me what is this error about. Is there any other option than  &quot;bind to socket&quot;<br>
that I can use.<br><br>Thanks.<br>
