<div style="direction: ltr;font-family: Tahoma;color: #000000;font-size: 10pt;">I'm running OpenMPI 1.8.7 tests on a mixed bag cluster of various systems<br>
under CentOS 6.3, I've been intermittently getting warnings about not having<br>
the proper NUMA libraries installed. Which NUMA libraries should be installed<br>
for CentOS 6.3 and OpenMPI 1.8.7? <br>
<br>
Here's what I currently have installed:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yum list installed *numa*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; numactl.x86_64<br>
<br>
Here's the list of available NUMA libraries for CentOS 6.3:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; listed via: yum search numa | less<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; numactl-devel.i686 : Development package for building Applications that use numa<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; numactl-devel.x86_64 : Development package for building Applications that use<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : numa<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; numad.x86_64 : NUMA user daemon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; numactl.i686 : Library for tuning for Non Uniform Memory Access machines<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; numactl.x86_64 : Library for tuning for Non Uniform Memory Access machines<br>
<br>
Also, since this cluster actually has working NUMA nodes, could the lack<br>
of the proper NUMA libraries being installed cause any issues?<br>
