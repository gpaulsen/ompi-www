Hi raymond,<br><br>I have installed OpenMPI on both computers and my application works on on both of them, but when I try to communicate between them, the method MPI_Lookup_name can&#39;t resolve the name published by the other machine.<br>
<br>I&#39;ve tried to run the example from mpi-forum that uses MPI_Open_port too, but it didn&#39;t work either.<br>After reading about it on some FAQs e some other threads from the forum, I believe that I need to config my ssh options.<br>
