I&#39;m using R on a Ubuntu 8.10 machine, and, in particular, quite a lot of papply calls to analyse data. I&#39;m currently using the LAM implementation, as it&#39;s the only one I&#39;ve got to work properly. However, while it works fine on one PC, it fails with the error message <br>
<br>Error in mpi.comm.spawn(slave = system.file(&quot;Rslaves.sh&quot;, package = &quot;Rmpi&quot;),&nbsp; : <br>&nbsp; MPI_Error_string: error spawning process<br><br>when I try to run it over a network on two machines. However, I&#39;ve got passwordless ssh working fine, and the lamnodes command seems to suggest I&#39;ve got all the nodes up and running fine (the other computer is also Ubuntu 8.10) and lamhosts() from within R shows all the nodes perfectly well. I&#39;ve even got mpirun to work on both machines.<br>
<br>Can anyone help with (A) getting my current setup with R to work and / or (B) suggestions for getting OpenMPI to work at all! (and preferably on multiple machines).<br><br>Many thanks,<br>Paul Wardman<br>University of York<br>
