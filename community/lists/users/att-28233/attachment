    FWIW,<br>
    <br>
    there has been one attempt to set the OMP_* environment variables
    within OpenMPI, and that was aborted<br>
    because that caused crashes with a prominent commercial compiler.<br>
    <br>
    also, i&#39;d like to clarify that OpenMPI does bind MPI tasks (e.g.
    processes), and it is up to the OpenMP runtime to bind the OpenMP
    threads to the resources made available by OpenMPI to the MPI task.<br>
    <br>
    in this case, that means OpenMPI will bind a MPI tasks to 7 cores
    (for example cores 7 to 13), and it is up to the OpenMP runtime to
    bind each 7 OpenMP threads to one core previously allocated by
    OpenMPI<br>
    (for example, OMP thread 0 to core 7, OMP thread 1 to core 8, ...)</div></blockquote><div><br></div><div>Indeed. Hybrid programming is a two-step tango. The harder task (in some ways) is the placing MPI processes where I want. With omplace I could just force things (though probably not with Open MPI...haven&#39;t tried it yet), but I&#39;d rather have a more &quot;formulaic&quot; way to place processes since then you can script it. Now that I know about the ppr: syntax, I can see it&#39;ll be quite useful!</div></div><br clear="all"><div>The other task is to get the OpenMP threads in the &quot;right way&quot;. I was pretty sure KMP_AFFINITY=compact was correct (worked once...and, yeah, using Intel at present. Figured start there, then expand to figure out GCC and PGI). I&#39;ll do some experimenting with the OMP_* versions as a more-respected standard is always a good thing. <br></div><div><br></div><div>For others with inquiries into this, I highly recommend this page I found after my query was answered here:</div><div><br></div><div><a href="https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/kb_articles/parallel-job-execution-on-commodity-clusters/">https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/kb_articles/parallel-job-execution-on-commodity-clusters/</a><br></div><div><br></div><div>At this point, I&#39;m thinking I should start up an MPI+OpenMP wiki to map all the combinations of compiler+mpistack. </div><div><br></div><div>Or pray the MPI Forum and OpenMP combine and I can just look in a Standard. :D</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks,</div><div>Matt</div>-- <br><div class="gmail_signature"><div dir="ltr"><div><div dir="ltr"><div>Matt Thompson</div></div></div><blockquote style="margin:0px 0px 0px 40px;border:none;padding:0px"><div><div><div>Man Among Men</div></div></div><div><div><div>Fulcrum of History</div></div></div></blockquote></div></div>
