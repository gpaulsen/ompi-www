Thanks for all your suggestions.<br><br>Yes, indeed what I&#39;m trying to do is execute a serial program. All the documentation you mention was pretty useful.<br>I have another question, if mpirun launches several copies of the program on the different hosts, does it mean that I must have a copy of the program on all the nodes, because I&#39;m using NFS to share the location were my program is installed and it seems to work fine when I execute mpirun with simple scripts.<br>
