<div>Hello everybody, I am new here.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would like to know if Msc Nastran supports openmpi.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have been searching in google about Nastran and Openmpi but I couldn&#39;t find if it works or not.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Now I&#39;m using lam/mpi for nastran parallel jobs, but I have some problems with lam, nastran and sge, so I&#39;d like to upgrade to openmpi.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you very much.</div>
