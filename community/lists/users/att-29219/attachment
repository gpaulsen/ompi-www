What do you mean by fault tolerant application ?<div>from an OpenMPI point of view, if such a connection is lost, your application will no more be able to communicate, so killing it is the best option.</div><div>if your application has built in checkpoint/restart, then you have to restart it with mpirun after the first mpirun aborts and your environment is fixed.</div><div>or your batch manager should restart/resubmit the job, possibly on a different set of nodes.</div><div><br></div>makes sense ?<br><div><br></div><div>Cheers,</div><div><br></div><div>Gilles<br><br>On Monday, May 16, 2016, Zabiziz Zaz &lt;<a href="javascript:_e(%7B%7D,&#39;cvml&#39;,&#39;zabiziz@gmail.com&#39;);" target="_blank">zabiziz@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex"><div dir="ltr">Hi,<div>I&#39;m using openmpi-1.10.2 and sometimes I&#39;m receiving the message below:</div><div><div>--------------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>ORTE has lost communication with its daemon located on node:</div><div><br></div><div>  hostname:  xxxx</div><div><br></div><div>This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network</div><div>connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of</div><div>the daemon itself.
