    <pre>I am getting the following error, amidst many successful message sends:
[n10][[50048,1],1][../../../../../../ompi/mca/btl/tcp/btl_tcp_frag.c:118:mca_btl_tcp_frag_send] mca_btl_tcp_frag_send: writev error (0x7f6155970038, 578659815)
        Bad address(1)

</pre>
    Any ideas about what is going on or what I can do to fix it?<br>
    <br>
    I am using the openmpi-bin 1.4.2-4 Debian package on a cluster
    running Debian squeeze.<br>
    <br>
    I couldn't find a config.log file; there is
    /etc/openmpi/openmpi-mca-params.conf, which is completely commented
    out.<br>
    <br>
    Invocation is from R 3.0.1 (debian package) with Rmpi 0.6.3 built by
    me from source in a local directory. My sends all use mpi.isend.Robj
    and the receives use mpi.recv.Robj, both from the Rmpi library.<br>
    <br>
    The jobs were started with rmpilaunch; it and the hosts file are
    included in the attachments. TCP connections.&nbsp; rmpilaunch leaves me
    in an R session on the master.&nbsp; I invoked the code inside the
    toplevel() function toward the bottom of dbox-master.R. <br>
    <br>
    The program source files and other background information is in the
    attached file.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; n10 has the output of <code>ompi_info --all, and
      n1011 has other info for both nodes that were active (n10 was
      master; n11 had some slaves).<br>
