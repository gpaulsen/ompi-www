Hello,<br><br>I am using openmpi on several machines which have different user accounts and I cannot find a way to specify the login for each machine in the machinefile passed to mpirun.<br>The only solution I found is to use the -host argument of mpirun, such as:<br>
mpirun -np 2 --host user1@machine1,user2@machine2 MyProgram<br>which is very inconvenient with a lot of machines.<br><br>Is there a way to do the same using a machinefile text? :<br>mpirun -np 2 -machinefile machinefile.txt MyProgram<br>
<br>I cannot find the appropriate syntax for specifying a user in machinefile.txt...<br><br>Thanks in advance,<br><br>Olivier<br><br>
