We could, of course, add a flag to indicate "we are using a shellscript version of srun" so we know to quote things, but it would mean another thing that the user would have to do (as opposed to just running out-of-the-box).</div><div><br></div><div>If we quote everything by default, then we have to modify our parser to strip the quotes when someone isn't using a script wrapper or else the system gets in trouble - but Jeff is concerned about us stripping things by default in case a user specifies an MCA param value that actually begins/ends with quotes. I'm not sure that's a valid use-case, but we'll debate it.</div><div><br></div><div>Either way, we'll give you a solution.</div><div>Ralph</div><div><br></div><div><br><div><div>On Sep 3, 2014, at 6:27 AM, Matt Thompson &lt;<a href="mailto:fortran@gmail.com">fortran@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:</div><br class="Apple-interchange-newline"><blockquote type="cite"><div dir="ltr"><div class="gmail_extra"><div class="gmail_quote">On Tue, Sep 2, 2014 at 8:38 PM, Jeff Squyres (jsquyres) <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:jsquyres@cisco.com" target="_blank">jsquyres@cisco.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br>

<br>
Ralph's point on the call today is that it doesn't matter *how* this problem is happening.&nbsp; It *is* happening to real users, and so we need to account for it.<br>
<br>
But it really bothers me that we don't understand *how/why* this is happening (e.g., is this OMPI's fault somehow?&nbsp; I don't think so, but then again, we don't understand how it's happening).&nbsp; *Somewhere* in there, a shell is getting invoked.&nbsp; But "srun" shouldn't be invoking a shell on the remote side -- it should be directly fork/exec'ing the tokens with no shell interpretation at all.<br>

It seems to be a wrapper around the regular srun that runs a --task-prolog. What it does...that's beyond my ken, but I could ask. My guess is that it probably does something that helps keep our old PBS scripts running (sets $PBS_NODEFILE, say). We used to run PBS but switched to SLURM recently. The admins would, of course, prefer all future scripts be SLURM-native scripts, but there are a lot of production runs that uses many, many PBS scripts. Converting that would need slow, careful QC to make sure any "pure SLURM" versions act as expected.</div>
