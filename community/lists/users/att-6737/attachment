<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" ><tr><td valign="top" style="font: inherit;">Hello,<br><br>We have created a piece of software that is designed to work under a variety of conditions, one of which is using MPI.<br><br>This application will preferably us a single executable and then load the mpi communications interface as a library at runtime, however adding this functionality by compiling using the mpi compile wrappers creates an executable that will not run on a system without mpi installed. <br><br>Is it possible to have the main executable not dependent upon the presence of mpi but still able to load the mpi dependent library if mpi is required, and how would this be achieved?<br><br>Thank you,<br><br>Alex<br><br></td></tr></table><br>
