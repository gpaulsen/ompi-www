Dear all, <br><br>I had to try the checkpoint/restart function of Openmpi recently, and after several failure and checking lots of the docement, I am still very confused about how to config the checkpoint/restart function. Can anybody give me a $HOME/.openmpi/mca-params.conf script and introduce me what parameters I should specified when i install the openmpi?<br>
<br>BTW, I want to install the openmpi1.5.1 and blcr 0.8.0.<br><br><br>Thanks<br>Xianjun Meng<br>
