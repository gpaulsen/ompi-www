&gt; Sadly, I have minimal experience with .debs... if someone would contribute the necessary packaging, we could talk about hosting a source deb on the main Open MPI site.<br>

  Description-en: LAM runtime environment for executing parallel programs<br>
   LAM (Local Area Multicomputer) is an open source implementation of the<br>
   Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard.<br>
   .<br>
   Some enhancements in LAM 6.3 are:<br>
    o Added the MPI-2 C++ bindings package (chapter 10 from the MPI-2<br>
        standard) from the Laboratory for Scientific Computing at the<br>
        University of Notre Dame.<br>
    o Added ROMIO MPI I/O package (chapter 9 from the MPI-2 standard)<br>
        from the Argonne National Laboratory.<br>
    o Pseudo-tty support for remote IO (e.g., line buffered output).<br>
    o Ability to pass environment variables through mpirun.<br>
    o Ability to mpirun shell scripts/debuggers/etc. (that eventually<br>
        run LAM/MPI programs).<br>
    o Ability to execute non-MPI programs across the multicomputer.<br>
    o Added configurable ability to zero-fill internal LAM buffers<br>
        before they are used (for development tools such as Purify).<br>
    o Greatly expanded error messages; provided for customizable<br>
        local help files.<br>
    o Expanded and updated documentation.<br>
    o Various bug fixes and minor enhancements.<br>

The LAM site housed one or two things other than LAM which might still<br>
be of interest, but I don&#39;t remember what off-hand.<br>
