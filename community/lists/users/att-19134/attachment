Any chance you could upgrade to Open MPI 1.5.5?  It has a better version of the processor affinity stuff than the 1.4 series.
<br><br>Did this and recompiled everything that depended on OMPI. No difference whatsoever. It still tells me, if I specify -np 2 for example, that &quot;There are not enough slots available in the system to satisfy the 2 slots <br>
that were requested by the application.&quot; <br><br>&gt;My bad. I did not read the bottom part of the email. 
Not sure If this would help, but can u try, --mca btl sm,self ?
<br><br>This also does not change anything...<br><br>Really confused what is going on here!<br><br>Kyle<br>
