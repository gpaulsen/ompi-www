    Does this happen only with master ?<br>
    <br>
    what does<br>
    ldd mpicc<br>
    says ?<br>
    does it require both libnl and libnl3 ?<br>
    <br>
    libnl3 is used by OpenMPI if libnl3-devel package is installed,<br>
    and this is not the case on your system<br>
    <br>
    a possible root cause is third party libs use libnl3, and the
    reachable/netlink component<br>
    tries to use libnl, in this case, installing libnl3-devel should fix
    your issue<br>
    /* you will need to re-configure after that */<br>
    <br>
    an other possible root cause is some third party libs use libnl and
    other use libnl3,<br>
    and in this case, i am afraid there is no simple workaround.<br>
    if installing libnl3-devel did not solve your issue, you can give a
    try to<br>
    <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/pull/1014">https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/pull/1014</a><br>
    at least, it will abort with an error message that states which lib
    is using libnl and which is using libnl3<br>
    <br>
    i am afraid the only option is to manually disable some components,
    so only one flavor of lib nl is used.<br>
    that can be achieved by adding a .opal_ignore empty file in the dir
    of the components you want to disable.<br>
    /* you will need to rerun autogen.pl after that */<br>
    <br>
    Cheers,<br>

                    The system in question is a CentOS 7 box, that has
                    been running OpenMPI, both the master branch and the
                    1.10.2 release happily until now.<br>
                    <br>
                  </div>
                  Just now, in order to debug something, I recompiled
                  with the following options:<br>
                  <br>
                  $ ./configure --enable-debug --enable-debug-symbols
                  --disable-dlopen<br>
                  <br>
                </div>
                The compilation and install was successful; however,
                mpicc now crashes like this:<br>
                <br>
                [durga@smallMPI ~]$ mpicc -Wall -Wextra -o mpitest

                mpicc: route/tc.c:973: rtnl_tc_register: Assertion `0'
                failed.<br>

              Searching the mailing archive, I found two posts that
              describe similar situations:<br>

              <br>
            </div>
            However, the solution proposed in these, to disable verbs,
            is not acceptable to me for the following reasons: I am
            trying to implement a new BTL by reverse engineering the
            openib BTL. I am using a Qlogic HCA for this purpose.
            (Please note that I cannot use PSM as I am writing code for
            a BTL)<br>
            <br>
          </div>
          As there any more acceptable solutions for this? Here are the
          list of nl libraries on my box:<br>
          <br>
          [durga@smallMPI ~]$ sudo yum list installed | grep libnl<br>
          libnl.x86_64                          
          1.1.4-3.el7                     @anaconda<br>
          libnl-devel.x86_64                    
          1.1.4-3.el7                     @anaconda<br>
          libnl3.x86_64                         
          3.2.21-10.el7                   @base    <br>
          libnl3-cli.x86_64                     
          3.2.21-10.el7                   @base    <br>
          <br>
        </div>
        and uninstalling libnl3 is not an option either: it seems yum 
        wants to uninstall around 100 odd other packages because of
        dependency which will essentially render the machine unusable.<br>
