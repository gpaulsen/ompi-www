Hello Riccardo,<div><br></div><div>I basically have to implement a 4D vector. An additional goal of my project is to support char, int, float and double datatypes in the vector. I figured that the only way to do this is through a template. Up to this point I was only supporting doubles in my vector, and I was sending each element individually from node to node. Since MPI_Send and MPI_Recv require the programmer to specify which datatype to use, and since I would only use doubles in the initial version of my project, using  MPI_Send and MPI_Recv was easy. However if I am to declare my 4D vector like this <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; ">std::vector&lt;T&gt; , there will be no way for me to know which datatype to specify in the </span> MPI_Send and MPI_Recv commands. </div>

<div><br></div><div>No I haven&#39;t looked at Boost.MPI . I did a quick Ctrl-F of Boost.MPI in the MPI 2.2 doc that i found here: <a href="http://www.mpi-forum.org/docs/docs.html">http://www.mpi-forum.org/docs/docs.html</a> , but i was unable to find it. Could you point me to some resources about it? It would be a lot easier to use that rather than send every element 1 by 1.</div>

<div><br></div><div>Thank you very much for your help.</div><div><br></div><div>Alex<br><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Mon, Aug 9, 2010 at 4:09 PM, Riccardo Murri <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:riccardo.murri@gmail.com">riccardo.murri@gmail.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br>

</div>I&#39;m not sure I understand what your question is about: are you asking<br>
what MPI datatypes you should use to send C types &quot;long&quot;, &quot;int&quot;, etc.,<br>
or are you trying to send a more complex C type (&quot;vector&quot;)?<br>
Can you send some code demonstrating the  problem you are trying to solve?<br>
<br>
Besides, your wording suggests that you are trying to send a C++<br>
std::vector&lt;T&gt; over MPI: have you already had a look at Boost.MPI?  It<br>
has out-of-the-box support for STL containers.<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
Riccardo<br>
