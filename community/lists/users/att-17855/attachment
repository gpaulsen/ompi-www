<br>Unfortunately that did not solve the problem.
<br>
<br>Can you tell me something more about how the sockets work and how they could

get corrupted? Maybe I can figure out what is going wrong.

<br>Hi,
<br>
<br>This looks not normal, because this error might happen mainly by improper
<br>
sockets. I don't have any clue at moment, as I can't reproduce it.
<br>
<br>Could you try to reinstall Open MPI? And make sure there is no other
<br>
installation on your system. If this is still not working, try using Open MPI
<br>
1.5.3. Please let me know whether these will work for you or not.
<br>
<br>Regards,
<br>
Shiqing

<br>Hi
<br>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<br>I've installed the OpenMPI 1.5.4-1 64-bit binaries on windows 7 when I run
<br>
mpirun.exe without any options I get the help text and everything seems to
<br>
work fine but when I try to actually run a application, I get the following
<br>
error:
<br>
<br>..\..\..\openmpi-1.5.4\opal\event\event.c: ompi_evesel-&gt;dispatch() failed.
<br>
<br>I get the error when running any application, to exclude my own application I
<br>
tried the hello world example and it returns the same error. (The command I
<br>
used is mpirun.exe helloworld.exe)
<br>
<br>Searching for the error in the list or looking at event.c didn't get me much
<br>
further, can anyone point me in the right direction for solving this problem?
<br>
