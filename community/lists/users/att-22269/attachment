The CUDA code is not in the 1.6 series as it was developed after that series went &quot;stable&quot;. It is in the 1.7 series, although the level of support will likely be incrementally increasing as that &quot;feature&quot; series continues to evolve.<br>

&gt; Hello OpenMPI,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I am wondering what level of support is there for CUDA and GPUdirect on OpenMPI 1.6.5 and 1.7.2.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I saw the ./configure --with-cuda=CUDA_DIR option in the FAQ. However, it seems that with configure v1.6.5 it was ignored.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Can you identify GPU memory and send messages from it directly without copying to host memory first?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Or in general, what level of CUDA support is there on 1.6.5 and 1.7.2 ? Do you support SDK 5.0 and above?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Cheers ...<br>
&gt; Michael<br>
