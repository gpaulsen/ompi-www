<div dir="ltr">Good suggestions, and thanks!   But since I haven&#39;t been able to get the problem to recur and I&#39;m stuck now on other issues related to getting parallel hdf5 to pass its make check, I will likely not follow up on this particular (non-recurring) issue (except maybe I should forward your comments to the HDF5 support team, since this is their test.)<br>

<br>
I&#39;m asking because I don&#39;t know offhand if the the file close+delete is supposed to be collective and not return until the file is guaranteed to be deleted, as visible from all MPI processes, or not.<br>
<br>
If this guarantee is not provided, then perhaps a barrier between the close+delete and the next file_open should be sufficient to avoid the race...?<br>

&gt; MPI_ABORT was invoked on rank 1 in communicator MPI_COMM_WORLD<br>
&gt; with errorcode 1.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; But when I reran the same mpirun command, the test was successful.   And deleting the executable and recompiling and then again running the same mpirun command, the test was successful.   Can someone explain that?<br>

&gt; Aha.   I guess I didn&#39;t know what the io-romio option does.   If you look at my config.log you will see my configure line included --disable-io-romio.    Guess I should change --disable to --enable.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; You seem to imply that the nightly build is stable enough that I should probably switch to that rather than 1.7.4rc1.   Am I reading between the lines correctly?<br>

&gt; Oh, a word of caution on those config params - you might need to check to ensure I don&#39;t disable romio in them. I don&#39;t normally build it as I don&#39;t use it. Since that is what you are trying to use, just change the &quot;no&quot; to &quot;yes&quot; (or delete that line altogether) and it will build.<br>

&gt; You can find my configure options in the OMPI distribution at contrib/platform/intel/bend/mac. You are welcome to use them - just configure --with-platform=intel/bend/mac<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I work on the developer&#39;s trunk, of course, but also run the head of the 1.7.4 branch (essentially the nightly tarball) on a fairly regular basis.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; As for the opal_bitmap test: it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if that one was stale. I can check on it later tonight, but I&#39;d suspect that the test is bad as we use that class in the code base and haven&#39;t seen an issue.<br>

&gt; I have been struggling trying to get a usable build of openmpi on Mac OSX Mavericks (10.9.1).  I can get openmpi to configure and build without error, but have problems after that which depend on the openmpi version.<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; With 1.6.5, make check fails the opal_datatype_test, ddt_test, and ddt_raw tests.  The various atomic_* tests pass.    See checklogs_1.6.5, attached as a .gz file.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Following suggestions from openmpi discussions I tried openmpi version 1.7.4rc1.  In this case make check indicates all tests passed.  But when I proceeded to try to build a parallel code (parallel HDF5) it failed.  Following an email exchange with the HDF5 support people, they suggested I try to compile and run the attached bit of simple code Sample_mpio.c (which they supplied) which does not use any HDF5, but just attempts a parallel write to a file and parallel read.   That test failed when requesting more than 1 processor -- which they say indicates a failure of the openmpi installation.   The error message was:<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; MPI_INIT: argc 1<br>
&gt; MPI_INIT: argc 1<br>
&gt; Testing simple C MPIO program with 2 processes accessing file ./mpitest.data<br>
&gt;     (Filename can be specified via program argument)<br>
&gt; Proc 0: hostname=Ron-Cohen-MBP.local<br>
&gt; Proc 1: hostname=Ron-Cohen-MBP.local<br>
&gt; MPI_BARRIER[0]: comm MPI_COMM_WORLD<br>
&gt; MPI_BARRIER[1]: comm MPI_COMM_WORLD<br>
&gt; Proc 0: MPI_File_open with MPI_MODE_EXCL failed (MPI_ERR_FILE: invalid file)<br>
&gt; MPI_ABORT[0]: comm MPI_COMM_WORLD errorcode 1<br>
&gt; MPI_BCAST[1]: buffer 7fff5a483048 count 1 datatype MPI_INT root 0 comm MPI_COMM_WORLD<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I then went back to my openmpi directories and tried running some of the individual tests in the test and examples directories.  In particular in test/class I found one test that seem to not be run as part of make check which failed, even with one processor; this is opal_bitmap.  Not sure if this is because 1.7.4rc1 is incomplete, or there is something wrong with the installation, or maybe a 32 vs 64 bit thing?   The error message is<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; mpirun detected that one or more processes exited with non-zero status, thus causing the job to be terminated. The first process to do so was:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;   Process name: [[48805,1],0]<br>
&gt;   Exit code:    255<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Any suggestions?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; More generally has anyone out there gotten an openmpi build on Mavericks to work with sufficient success that they can get the attached Sample_mpio.c (or better yet, parallel HDF5) to build?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Details: Running Mac OS X 10.9.1 on a mid-2009 Macbook pro with 4 GB memory; tried openmpi 1.6.5 and 1.7.4rc1.  Built openmpi against the stock gcc that comes with XCode 5.0.2, and gfortran 4.9.0.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Files attached: config.log.gz, openmpialllog.gz (output of running ompi_info --all), checklog2.gz (output of make.check in top openmpi directory).<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I am not attaching logs of make and install since those seem to have been successful, but can generate those if that would be helpful.<br>
