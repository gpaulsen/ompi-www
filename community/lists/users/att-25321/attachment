        I would like to run mpi with one process per node, e.g., using<br>
        -cpus-per-rank=1.  Then I want to use openmp inside of that.<br>
        But other times I will run with a rank on each physical core.<br>
        <br>
        Inside my code I would like to detect which situation I am in.<br>
        Is there an openmpi api call to determine that?<br>

    <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">omp_get_num_threads()
      should work.  Unless you want to choose a different non-parallel
      algorithm for this case, a single thread omp parallel region works
      fine.<br>
      You should soon encounter cases where you want intermediate
      choices, such as 1 rank per CPU package and 1 thread per core,
      even if you stay away from platforms with more than 12 cores per
      CPU.<br>
