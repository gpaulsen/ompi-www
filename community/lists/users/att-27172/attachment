<p>Hi everyone, <br>
<br>
We recently upgraded the hwloc library used by the schedulers (along with openmpi and all applications compiled with it), but apparently Abaqus is using an internal MPI (PMPI) which still points to old hwloc versions that are not compatible. As a result, Abaqus
 either crashes or runs extremely slow. <br>
<br>
Abaqus documentation suggests that it may be possible to run it using an external MPI stack, and I am hoping to make it work with our stock openmpi/1.8.4 that knows how to talk with the scheduler's hwloc. Unfortunately, however, all of my attempts failed miserably
 so far (no specific instructions for openmpi). <br>
<br>
I was wondering if anyone had success with getting Abaqus running with openmpi. Even the information of whether it is possible or not will help us a great deal.
<br>
<br>
Thanks for your help! <br>

<p>PS: I sent a similar question to the mvapich2 list as well. If they respond with some information that can be applied to openmpi, I will happily share them here.
