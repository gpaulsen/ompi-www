Hi Jodi,<br><br>&gt; I once got different results when running on a 64-Bit platform instead of
<br>
&gt; a 32 bit platform - if i remember correctly, the reason was that on the
<br>
&gt; 32-bit platform 80bit extended precision floats were used but on the 64bit
<br>
&gt; platform only 64bit floats.
<br><br>Could you please give me an idea as how to check this extended precision.<br>Also I don&#39;t use float rather I use only double or long double.<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Asad<br>-- <br>&quot;Statistical thinking will one day be as necessary for efficient citizenship as the ability to read and write.&quot; - H.G.
