<div> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thank you. This worked, although I had to use the sun C-compiler rather than the gcc compiler (your email below seemed to imply that the fix was related to using the gcc compiler).<br>

I appreciate the help,<br>

If you follow the steps outlined in the above FAQ entry you should be <br>
able to build OpenMPI.  If not please drop another<br>
email with the results and I'll see what I can do. <br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; Hello,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I have been attempting to install OpenMPI with the Sun Fortran Compiler<br>
&gt; that is packaged as a part of Sun Studio for x86 architectures for<br>
&gt; about a year and a half now without success. Every time a new version<br>
&gt; of Sun Studio and/or OpenMPI comes out, I have attempted the install<br>
&gt; again with the hopes that whatever has been causing the problem will<br>
&gt; have magically been fixed. However at this point, it appears that<br>
&gt; whatever is causing the install problems is something unkown to your<br>
&gt; development team ... so I figure it is time to report it.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I am currently trying to install the Sun F90 compiler with<br>
&gt; openmpi-1.2.6 on a 64-bit intel machine running Red Hat Linux<br>
&gt; Enterprise 5. I have also tried this same install on a variety of<br>
&gt; 32-bit intel architectures with 2 other flavors of linux, and I get the<br>
&gt; same errors. I have attached the install script that I use to install<br>
&gt; OpenMPI for each of the FORTRAN packages that I use (OpenMPI installs<br>
&gt; successfully for the 4 other FORTRAN packages in this install script).<br>
&gt; I have also attached 2 sets of output streams with different error<br>
&gt; messages. One of these output streams corresponds to the result that I<br>
&gt; get when setting the C-compiler to gcc in the install script, and the<br>
&gt; other corresponds to setting the C-compiler to the C-compiler that is<br>
&gt; included with Sun Studio.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Note also that I have not had any problems with getting the Sun<br>
&gt; compilers (Fortran and C) installed with MPICH2, so I am confused as to<br>
&gt; what may be the issue with OpenMPI. I prefer to use OpenMPI, so I would<br>
&gt; like to figure this issue out.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Thanks in advance,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Rob<br>
