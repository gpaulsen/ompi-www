    Ben,<br>
    <br>
    what is the minimum number of nodes required to reproduce the issue
    ?<br>
    e.g. can you reproduce it with one node ?<br>
    <br>
    Cheers,<br>

Both are built against TM explicitly using the --with-tm option.

Yes, it appears to use TM from what I can see. Outputs from 1.10.0 and
1.10.2 are attached from inside the same job - they look identical (apart
from the pids), except at the very end where 1.10.2 errors out while 1.10.1
continues.

      <pre wrap="">
The "-np 2" is because that's what I was using to benchmark the install
(osu_bibw) and I just copied it over from when I realised it wasn't even
starting. But it does the same regardless of whether I specify the number of
processes or not (without it gets the number of tasks from PBS).

      <pre wrap="">thread per core */

The nodes are 2 x 8-core sockets with hyper-threading on, and you can chose
whether to use the extra hardware threads when submitting the job. If you
want them, your cgroup includes both threads on each core (e.g. 0-31),
otherwise only one thread (e.g. 0-15) (cores 16-32 are the thread siblings
of cores 0-15).

For reference, the PBS job I was using above had ncpus=32,mem=16G, which
becomes

  select=2:ncpus=16:mpiprocs=16:mem=8589934592b

under the hood with a cpuset containing cores 0-15 on each of the two nodes.

Interestingly, if I use a cpuset containing both threads of each physical
core (i.e. ask for hyperthreading on job submission), then it runs fine
under 1.10.2.

Cheers,
Ben

Ben,



that is not needed if you submit with qsub -l nodes=1:ppn=2 do you observe
the same behavior without -np 2 ?

Were there any changes to rmaps in going to 1.10.2? An 
otherwise-identical setup that worked in 1.10.0 fails to launch in

There are both in the same PBS Pro job. And the cpuset definitely has

0-15

Is there something here I'm missing?
