The test program is available here:<br><a href="http://code.google.com/p/pypar/source/browse/source/mpi_test.c">http://code.google.com/p/pypar/source/browse/source/mpi_test.c</a><br><br>Hopefully, someone can help us troubleshoot why communications stop when multiple nodes are involved and CPU usage goes to 100% for as long as we leave the program running.<br>

<div><div></div><div><br><div class="gmail_quote">Hi all<br><br>We have been using OpenMPI for many years with Ubuntu on our 20-node cluster. Each node has 2 quad cores, so we usually run up to 8 processes on each node up to a maximum of 160 processes.<br>



<br>However, we just upgraded the cluster to Ubuntu 11.04 with Open MPI 1.4.3 and and have come across a strange behavior where mpi programs run perfectly well when confined to one node but hangs during communication across multiple nodes. We have no idea why and would like some help in debugging this. A small MPI test program is attached and typical output shown below.<br>
