          like --mca btl_sm_knem_dma_min 4860 is enough or I have to add
          more flag like --mca btl_sm_eager_limit 4276 in the same run?
          or can you please suggest me a good documentation link about
          knem flag usage, I have tried to look around but no good info
          regarding those staff. otherwise I will end up to test each
          command with different flag value for each run.</span><br>

    What are you trying to do?<br>
    <br>
    * Use knem for direct copy through kernel for medium/large messages:
    (common use case)<br>
    "--mca btl_sm_use_knem 1" is enough. You can "cat /dev/knem" before
    and after a run to see that knem counters have increased, which
    means OMPI successfully passed some copy requests to knem.<br>
    <br>
    * Use knem for short messages:<br>
    "--mca btl_sm_eager_limit 4276" may help. But I am not sure that's a
    good idea since knem was designed for large messages.<br>
    <br>
    * Offload knem copies to I/OAT hardware on Intel servers. That's
    what "btl_sm_knem_dma_min" is for. Not sure you really want to do
    that either, it's not much interesting on current Intel servers.<br>
