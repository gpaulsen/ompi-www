you shouldn't need the following lines:

export LIBMPI = -lmpi

export MPIDIR=/nfs/sjafer/phd/openMPI/installed
export LDFLAGS +=-L$(MPIDIR)/lib
export INCLUDES_CPP += -I$(MPIDIR)/include

It also doesn't seem like the last 2 arguments of this line are a good  
idea (the linker should automatically put /usr/lib and /lib in your  
search path, if appropriate):

export LDFLAGS+=-L. -L$/usr/lib -L$/lib

I also notice:

export CPP=mpic++
export CC=mpiCC

I think you want "mpicc" for CC (note the lower case) -- mpiCC is the
C 
++ compiler (mpic++ and mpiCC are synonyms).

This might solve your problem.

&gt; &gt; I installed openmpi-1.2.7 and tested the hello_c and ring_c examples
&gt; &gt; on single and multiple node and worked fine. However, when I use
&gt; &gt; openmpi with my simulator (by replacing the old mpich path with the
&gt; &gt; new openmpi ) I get many errors reported from "/openMPI/
&gt; &gt; openmpi-1.2.7/include/openmpi/ompi/mpi/cxx/*.h" . Please see the
&gt; &gt; following snap shots:

&gt; It's not clear exactly what you did here.  Did you just replace
&gt; MPICH's "mpiCC" with OMPI's "mpiCC"?  FWIW,
this is
&gt; almost always the
&gt; easiest way to compile MPI applications: use that implementation's
&gt; "wrapper" compiler (I'm assuming you have a C++ code in this
&gt; case).
&gt;
&gt; These errors should not normally happen; they look kinda like you're
&gt; somehow inadvertently mixing Open MPI and MPICH.
