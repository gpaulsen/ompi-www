Hi all,<br><br>is it possible to set MCA parameters from within the MPI
program itself? The FAQ only mentions how to set them through files or
environment variables.<br><br>I would like to set coll_tuned_use_dynamic_rules and coll_tuned_alltoall_algorithm.<br>
<br>I assume there is a function to do this  in include/opal/mca but
I&#39;m not sure which one. And I couldn&#39;t find any documentation
explaining it.<br>I&#39;m aware that this will only work with OpenMPI and
is probably not part of the public api thus the interface might change
between version.<br>
<br>My plan is to benchmark all alltoall algorithms at start up and
then use this algorithm for all later AllToAll calls. I have
benchmarked that manually choosing the algorithm can make a large 
difference. Also all my alltoall communication is of the same data size
thus tuning is easy.<br>
