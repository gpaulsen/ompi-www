Hello everyone,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I downloaded openmpi-1.3 version from night tarballs to check RDMA-CM support. I am able to compile and install it, but dont know how to run it as there is no documentation provided. Did someone try running it with OpenMPI?<br />My another question is Does OpenMPI1.3 has progress-threads support for IB? Because while compiling with that option, it didnt give me any warnings or failure unlike openmpi1.2.X series does.<br /><br />Regards<br />Neeraj<br />
