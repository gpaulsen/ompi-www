Hi,<br><br>I installed open MPI on Linux cluster which consist of three machines. I want to ask how can I check that open MPI work correctly and is there a special configurations that I need to set to make the machines connect to each other because I just installed open MPI without making extra configurations. <br><br>Regards<br> 		 	   		  </div></body>
