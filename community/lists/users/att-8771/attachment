I&#39;m sure that I&#39;m not the first person who wants their MPI program to compile when MPI is not available. It seems like the simplest solution to this is to have a header file (with implementation, or header file and .c file) that implements all of the functions for the case when MPI isn&#39;t available on a system. I found something called MPI_STUBS via google, but some of the links are broken, and I&#39;ve searched the archives. This seems like the kind of thing that tons of people have done for themselves, and I&#39;m hoping to avoid doing it for myself.<br>
