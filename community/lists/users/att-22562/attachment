Perhaps the problem is that you don't have permission for "at"? Per the man page:<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt;   The superuser may use these commands in any case.  For  other  users,  permission  to  use  at  is  determined  by  the  files  /etc/at.allow  and<br>&gt; &gt;        /etc/at.deny.<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt;        If the file /etc/at.allow exists, only usernames mentioned in it are allowed to use at.<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt;        If /etc/at.allow does not exist, /etc/at.deny is checked, every username not mentioned in it is then allowed to use at.<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt;        If neither exists, only the superuser is allowed use of at.<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt;        An empty /etc/at.deny means that every user is allowed use these commands, this is the default configuration.<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; You also might check to see what directory mpirun is executed from when "at" actually runs, and that the path to both mpirun and your executable are correct for that location.<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; On Aug 26, 2013, at 6:45 PM, Ng Shi Wei &lt;nsw_1216@hotmail.com&gt; wrote:<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi all,<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; <br>&gt; &gt;&gt; Due to the time constraints, I would like to run the mpi program by scheduling the program to run on desired time using the "at" command.
