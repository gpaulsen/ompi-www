    Hi Bradi,<br>
    <br>
    Yes, as you are on an XP machine, the io forwarding is not working
    for Open MPI. So you won't see the remote output from the local
    command windows. The only way is to direct the output into a file,
    for example: mpirun -n 2 app.exe &gt; output.txt . This will
    generate the output file on remote computer under the same path
    where you run on local computer.<br>
    <br>
    Regards,<br>

      &nbsp; <br>
      I have 2 windows Xp computers connected through an ethernet
      network. I have installed openMPI using the windows installer <a
        moz-do-not-send="true"
href="http://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v1.5/downloads/OpenMPI_v1.5.4-1_win32.exe">OpenMPI_v1.5.4-1_win32.exe</a>
      on every computer. I have set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable to
      "C:\Program Files\OpenMPI_v1.5.4-win32\lib" (this is the directory
      where the installation extracted my files)<br>
      and the PATH "C:\Program Files\OpenMPI_v1.5.4-win32\bin". I have
      configured the 2 computers so that I can launch processes
      remotely. The command used to launch the process is <br>
      <b>mpirun -H Cooler.lan,mugiwara-4adeb0 -n 2 MPI1.exe <br>
      </b>where the program simply outputs the rank and the processor
      name.<br>
      My problem is that the output is not collected to the stdout of
      the rank 0 process. On the remote machine I simply see that the
      process is launched and when execution finishes is destroyed. I
      want to find a solution to this , because I have no ideea what
      could be causing this. Please if you could suggest a solution to
      my problem I would be very thankful.<br>
      The process can be launched locally with success. ethNode1.txt
      contains the ipconfig /all on node 1, ompi_infoNode1.txt contains
      the result of command&nbsp;<b>ompi_info -v ompi full --parsable </b>and
      ompi_info.txt the result of ompi_info -all command.<br>
      <br>
      Thank-you in advance.<br>
