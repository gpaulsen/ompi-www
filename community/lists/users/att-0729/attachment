Hi All<br>
<br>
I am a total novice to the MPI world, so please forgive me if any of my questions/comments sound stupid.<br>
<br>
First, a few *possible* bugfixes:<br>
<br>
When I downloaded openMPI and tried to compile it for our MIPS64 platform, it broke at 3 places.<br>
<br>
1. The configure script in the root directory did not have a case for
MIPS64. That is fixed in the attached patch.configure patch file.<br clear="all">2.
The <a href="http://Makefile.am">Makefile.am</a> in opal/asm/ directory is incorrect. It creates a
platform-dependent file called atomic-asm.s that has #include's in it.
According to gcc manual, .s assembly files are NOT preprocessed and
hence none of the macros in the atomic-asm.s file were expanded.<br>
Note that it works fine for IA32 platforms because that version of
atomic-asm.s file does not have macros in it. The <a href="http://patch.Makefile.am">patch.Makefile.am</a>
fixes this. Note that you need to rerun automake after patching this
file.<br>
3. I don't remember the third place it broke right now. I can give out a third patch later.<br>
<br>
Now the question is: Is there a benchmark program I can run for the
openMPI suite of library? I tried NetPipe from <a href="http://Ameslab.gov">Ameslab.gov</a>. It seems to
run, but it terminates without producing any output, either to the
console or to any file. I tried specifying the output file explicitly
with the -o option, but to no avail.<br>
<br>
Any help is deeply appreciated.<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>
<br>

N.B. I noticed from the mailing list archive that there are other
people in this mailing list who are interested in the MIPS64
architecture. I would especially love hearing from them in off-line
conversations.<br>-- <br>Devil wanted omnipresence;<br>He therefore created communists.
