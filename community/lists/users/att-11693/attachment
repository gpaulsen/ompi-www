Hi Eugene,<br>
<br>
&nbsp; I believe that r22335 did solve resolve the issue.&nbsp; The problem was
between my screen and my chair.&nbsp; Last night, I reset my paths, but the
directory was appended to the paths which had the old mpi directory
information.&nbsp; I think it was linking with the old libraries.&nbsp; I'll try
it in a production run, but it passed the simpler tests that the old
library failed.&nbsp; I'll post another note if it fails anywhere, but I am
confident that the problem is resolved as you first thought.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Best regards,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lou<br>

Hmm, perhaps not so excellent.&nbsp; It seems to me that openmpi-1.4a1r22335
does have the fixes to trac 2043.&nbsp; So, either the fixes are
insufficient and/or you're experiencing a different problem.&nbsp; I'll see
if I can reproduce your problem, but I'm not confident here.<br>

Hi Eugene,<br>
&nbsp; Excellent!&nbsp; I could not find r22324.&nbsp; I found r22335 on the openmpi
download site (under nightly snapshots), but this did not solve the
problem.&nbsp; Any thoughts on where I can find it?<br>

What
about "-mca coll_sync_barrier_before 100"?&nbsp; (The default may be
1000.&nbsp; So, you can try various values less than 1000.&nbsp; I'm suggesting
100.)&nbsp; Note that broadcast has somewhat one-way traffic flow, which can
have some undesirable flow control issues.<br>
        <br>
2) What about "-mca btl_sm_num_fifos 16"?&nbsp; Default is 1.&nbsp; If the
problem is trac ticket 2043, then this suggestion can help.</blockquote>

Hi Eugene,<br>
        <br>
&nbsp; Thank you for replying so quickly.&nbsp; You are right that there is a
memory leak.&nbsp; It's not the source of the problem, but I added a
free(pMessage) to remove the issue.&nbsp; (In my defense, I borrowed a
simple broadcast example off the web and wrapped it in a loop.)<br>
        <br>
&nbsp; Anyway, the great news is that suggestion #2 solved the problem for
the example.&nbsp; (At least it has not failed yet.&nbsp; I'm exercising the
solution on the original larger problem now.)&nbsp; Suggestion #1 did not.&nbsp;
Should I post the resolution to the mailing list or is this a well
known solution?&nbsp; I see this parameter listed under performance tuning
on the ompi site, but only in reference to congestion.&nbsp; There is no
comment that bcasts could hang.<br>

Hi Eugene,<br>
&nbsp; OK.&nbsp; You nailed it with suggestion #2.<br>
&nbsp; Many thanks,<br>

Great.&nbsp; Next time, go ahead and respond to the wider mail alias so that
everyone learns that your particular problem was resolved.<br>
      <br>
I will update the trac ticket to point to this as another instance of
this problem.<br>
      <br>
One signature of the problem is that GCC 4.4.0 or later exposes the
problem, while earlier revs do not.&nbsp; I can't tell for sure, but it
appears to me that this condition is met with Fedora 11.<br>
      <br>
Our understanding of trac 2043 has recently improved immensely.&nbsp; It
would be great if you could confirm the fix.&nbsp; The ticket is at <a
 moz-do-not-send="true" class="moz-txt-link-freetext"
 href="https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/ticket/2043">https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/ticket/2043</a>
.&nbsp; r22324 should fix the
problem.&nbsp; If you could get that version, build with GCC (presumably
4.4.0 or more recent), then the workaround should no longer be needed.<br>
