<DIV dir=ltr id=idOWAReplyText50529>Greetings,</DIV>
<DIV dir=ltr>
<DIV dir=ltr>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV dir=ltr>I am using OpenMPI 1.4.3-1.1.el6 on RedHawk Linux 6.0.1 (Glacier) / RedHat Enterprise Linux Workstation Release 6.1 (Santiago).&nbsp; I am currently working through some issues that I encountered after upgrading from RedHawk 5.2 / RHEL 5.2 and OpenMPI 1.4.3-1 (openmpi-gcc_1.4.3-1).&nbsp; It seems that since the upgrades my software does not return from the call to the Finalize() routine.&nbsp; All threads enter the Finalize() routine and never return.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wrote a simple test program to try to simplify troubleshooting and Finalize() works as expected, i.e., all threads return from the Finalize() call.&nbsp; This suggests the problem is in my code.&nbsp; I have searched the man pages and user forums to no avail.&nbsp; Has anyone else encountered this problem?&nbsp; What could cause such behavior?&nbsp; I wondered if maybe there is still some prior communication that was left unfinished, but I believe I have verified that is not the case, plus my understanding of how Finalize() works is that it would error/exception out in such a situation rather than just sit there, but I could be wrong.</DIV>
<DIV dir=ltr>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV dir=ltr>Not sure what additional information may be needed by the community to aid in troubleshooting, but will be happy to provide whatever else is needed.</DIV>

<DIV dir=ltr>Kind regards,</DIV>
