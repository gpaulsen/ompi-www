&gt; Yes, this page is definitely incorrect if you want to run with PBS/TM  <br>&gt; support -- you definitely need to install with TM support on all nodes.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The reason is that PBS will launch your script (and therefore  <br>&gt; "mpirun") on the first node of the job.  This node must have an Open  <br>&gt; MPI mpirun with TM support so that it can query PBS to get the nodes  <br>&gt; to launch on, use the TM API to launch processes on the nodes  <br>&gt; allocated to the job, etc.<br>That's exactly the sound logic I understood from OpenMPI documentation but<br>I thought the website is reliable in the sense it configured the server node with<br>tm support.<br><br>I am very grateful to subscribe to this list.
