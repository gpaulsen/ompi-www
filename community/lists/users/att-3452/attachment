Greetings all,<br>
<br>
I downloaded and configured v1.2.2 this morning on an Opteron cluster
using the following configure directives...<br>
<br>
./configure --prefix=/share/apps CC=gcc CXX=g++ F77=g77 FC=gfortran
CFLAGS=-m64 CXXFLAGS=-m64 FFLAGS=-m64 FCFLAGS=-m64 <br>
<br>
Compilation seemed to go OK and there IS an mpif90 option in
/bin......but it gives me the following error when I try to compile my
source file:<br>
<br>
/share/apps/bin/mpif90 -c -I/share/apps/include -O3 ft.f<br>
Unfortunately, this installation of Open MPI was not compiled with<br>
Fortran 90 support.&nbsp; As such, the mpif90 compiler is non-functional.<br>
<br>
I am certain that gfortran is installed and working correctly as I
tested compilation of a small piece of serial code with it.<br>
<br>
Something I am doing wrong?<br>
