<div dir="ltr">Dear Gus Correa,<br><br>Thank you in advance for your detailed answer.<br>I was busy checking your steps. But unfortunately still I have the problem.<br><br>1) Yes, I have sudo access to server, when I want to run the test only my two instances are active.<br>

<br>2) There is no problem with running hello program simultaneously on two instances, but someone told me these programs cannot check some factors.<br><br>Instances are pure installation of ubuntu server 12.04, by the way I disabled &quot;ufw&quot;. There are two notes here, openmpi uses ssh and I can connect with no password from master to slave. And one more odd thing i​s that​ the order is important in myhosts file, ie, allways the second machine abort the process, even when I am in the master and master is second in the file, it reports that master aborted.<br>

<br>3,4) I checked it, actually, I did everything from the first step. Just installing Atlas and OpenMPI from packages with 64 switch to configure.<br><br>5) I used -np 4 with hello, is this sufficient?​<br><br>6) Yes, I checked auto-tuning (without input file) too.<br>

<br>One thing that I noticed is that a &quot;vnet&quot; created for each instance on the main server. I ran these two commands:<br>mirun -np 2 --hostfile myhosts --mca btl_tcp_if_include eth0,lo hpcc<br>mirun -np 2 --hostfile myhosts --mca btl_tcp_if_exclude vnet0,vnet1 hpcc<br>

<br>in this case I didn&#39;t receive anything, ie, no error nor anything in output file, I waited for hours but nothing happened. can these vnets cause the problem?<br><br>Really Thank you for your consideration,<br>Best Regards,<br>
