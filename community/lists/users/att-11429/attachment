Hi there<br><br>Lately I&#39;ve been reading lots of papers about fault tolerance for MPI applications. All seemed very nice and clear. But as soon as I pass the reading part to start testing I had my surprise as there I can not find implementations. The best I could find is the possibility of manually checkpoint and restart the application. No checkpoint protocol, no checkpoint manager, no recovery protocol. <br>
Can you please help and point me to a user transparent fault tolerance implementation for MPI applications?<br><br>Thanks a lot,<br>Andreea<br>
