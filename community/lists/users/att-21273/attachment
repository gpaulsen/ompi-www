LSF has dispatched node1 and node2 - correct? It sounds like you have also given those names aliases that refer to their IB ports - generally a very bad practice, but let's set that aside for now.<div><br></div><div>If they are the same physical nodes, then the node name makes no difference - OMPI will see both TCP and IB on the node and use them.

    Can you help me?&nbsp; <br>
    <div class="moz-forward-container"> <br>
      The <font color="#ff0000">b</font>node1.<font color="#ff0000">b</font>node2

      and node1,node2 are the hostnames of the same nodes corresponding
      to the InfiniBand and ethernet network respectively.<br>
      The node1,node2 are the nodes declarated in lsf.cluster.name<br>
      In order to use the IB network, I have modified the lsf mpijob
      script, and modified the HOSTFILE containing the nodes which LSF
      dispatched from node to bnode.<br>
      Then use "<font color="#ff0000">mpiexec -machinefile $HOSTFILE
        $COMMANDLINE</font>" to run my jobs.<br>
      But the job exits and shows:<br>
      -------------------------------------------------------------<br>
      A hostfile was provided that contains at least one node not<br>
      present in the allocation:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp; hostfile:&nbsp; /home/nic/hmli/.lsbatch/bhost23263.node1<br>
      &nbsp; node:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bnode2<br>
      <br>
      If you are operating in a<font color="#ff0000"> resource-managed
        environment, then only<br>
        nodes that are in the allocation can be used in the hostfile</font>.
      You<br>
      may find relative node syntax to be a useful alternative to<br>
      specifying absolute node names see the orte_hosts man page for<br>
      further information.<br>
      -------------------------------------------------------------<br>
      <br>
      I don't want to change the hostname from node to bnode in
      lsf.cluster.name.<br>
      <br>
      Thank you very much. <br>
