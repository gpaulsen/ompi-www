Hi,<br>  I am posting to this mailing list after a long time. How is our openMPI going?<br>  <br>  Folks, I have few queries.<br>  <br>  1. Are there any perl bindings to (Open) MPI?<br>  2. How difficult it would be to write a perl wrapper over existing&nbsp; MPI code.?<br>  3. Can I work with MPI without MPI's runtime environment.? Actually I want to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; use&nbsp; SunGrid Engine.<br>  <br>  To give a proper insight into my requirements, i shall explain my problem below.<br>  <br>  I need to run parallel jobs on a cluster typically of size 600 nodes  and running SGE, but the programmers are good at perl but not C or C++.  So i thought of MPI, but i dont know whether it has perl support?<br>  <br>  Feel free to suggest any other library with perl support.<br>  <br>  Thanks,<br>  Imran<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <p>&#32;
