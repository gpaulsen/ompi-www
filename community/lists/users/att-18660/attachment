    I've run into a problem upgrading from 1.4.3 to 1.4.4 or 1.4.5<br>
    <br>
    With 1.4.4 and 1.4.5, I'm getting error messages like<br>
    <br>
    <blockquote>[[59597,1],0] routed:binomial: Connection to lifeline
      [[59597,0],0] lost<br>
      <br>
    </blockquote>
    The error does not occur if I restrict the host list to localhost.<br>
    <br>
    Basic tests like 'mpirun hello_c' work properly.&nbsp; The problem occurs
    using the R package Rmpi package.&nbsp; (I've tried the R mailing lists,
    but so far to no avail.) This R package does work reliably with
    openmpi 1.4.3.<br>
    <br>
    Could some one explain what an error message like this indicates? Is
    something timing out? Any idea what changed after 1.4.3 that might
    lead to this kind of problem?<br>
    <br>
    FYI I'm running ompi under Debian 6.0.4 (squeeze).&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    thanks<br>
