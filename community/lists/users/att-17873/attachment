having trouble with running a MPI program on a linux (centos 5.7) cluster.<br>my cluster has 16 nodes and 12 cpu cores for each node.<br>each node has 2 connections to a switch, eth0 and eth2.<br>ip addresses of the nodes are set as :<br>
eth0 : <a href="http://192.168.1.1/16">192.168.1.1/16</a><br>eth2 : <a href="http://192.168.1.101/106">192.168.1.101/106</a><br>i would like to use eth2 for MPI communications.<br><br>i tried to run a program as :<br>mpiexec --mca btl_tcp_if_include eth2 --mca btl_tcp_if_exclude lo,eth0 -hostfile hostfile -n 192 ./my_program<br>
<br>the file &#39;hostfile&#39; has lines such as:<br>node101 slots=12<br>...<br><br>and /etc/hosts file has lines such as:<br>192.168.1.1 node001<br>...<br>192.168.1.101 node101<br>...<br><br>but the program just simply hangs/stalls at MPI_Bcast(...) or MPI_Barrier(...).<br>
MPI_Init(), MPI_Comm_rank(), and MPI_Comm_size() report exact results.<br>
<br>if the program is run when only the eth0 is set up (ifconfig eth2 down for all nodes and use another hostfile that contains node001 - node016), it runs just fine.<br><br>any help would be appreciated.<br>thanks in advance.<br>
