<div>When i use the function&nbsp; comm_spawn ,it can not to be work on an off-line host.<br>but it can run well when the network is connected using a fault configure.<br><br>on the page&nbsp; http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/users/2010/01/11825.php<br>
it says"Shared memory doesn't extend between comm_spawn'd parent/child 
processes in Open MPI. Perhaps someday it will, but not yet."<br><br><br>How can i run&nbsp; comm_spawn on an off-line host?<br>
