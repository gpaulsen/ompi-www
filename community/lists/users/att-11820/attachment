Hi everyone !<br><br>I have to submit you a question,<br>I write a little code that does and MPI_Comm_spawn_multiple on a specific set of node.<br>The node where to run on are specified using the &quot;host&quot; attribute of the MPI_Info object.<br>
That attribute is filled with the string get from MPI_Get_processor_name.<br><br>Is this the correct way of working ?<br><br>I have a strange behavior when I use alias in the /etc/hosts file.<br>(I run jobs in a linux cluster, with CentOS 5).<br>
If I use the alias in the hostfile the spawn process throws me an error;<br>instead the spawning process (run with the same hostfile) runs correctly.<br><br>It seems that is necessary, when using the spawn function with INFO object, <br>
to run the spawning process with a hostfile filled with the &quot;real&quot; and complete hostname.<br>Or I have to use a different function to get the host name?<br><br>Thank you very much,<br>Federico<br>
