Hi Ralph,<br>if what you say is true I don&#39;t understand why if I run a job in grid01 and grid03 it runs properly. They are on different network like grid03 and grid04.<br>But if I run the same job in grid03 and grid04 it fails.<br>
<br>If it is a network problem like you say I don&#39;t think that is  about reachable because I can trace the network traffic and see that grid03 and grid04 communicates when I run the job.<br><br>Alex<br><br>

&gt; Hi Ralph,<br>
&gt; what do you mean to create/define a directly interface?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The 3 hosts are network connected and ssh pub key enabled. Every<br>
&gt; hosts can see the other but they are not all on the same direct<br>
&gt; connected network . More in detail:<br>
&gt; grid01 and grid04 are in the same network<br>
&gt; grid03 is on different network.<br>
<br>
This is the problem. If grid03 is on a different network, then there<br>
is no way that an MPI process on that node can directly communicate<br>
with one on grid04 or grid01. Grid03 must have a common network<br>
interface with each of the machines, though it can be different for<br>
each one.<br>
<br>
In other words, grid03 and grid01 -must- have at least one network in<br>
common. And grid04 and grid03 must also share at least one network,<br>
though it can be different from the one that grid03 and grid01 share.<br>
<br>
Does that help clarify?<br>
