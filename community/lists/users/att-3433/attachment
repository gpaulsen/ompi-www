I <B>think</B> the problem is your &#8211;L flag. Our mpif90 wrapper compiler should already know where to find the MPI library, which is located in wherever you installed openmpi. Your flag is trying to overload our settings and I believe is causing confusion.<BR>
<BR>
So just eliminate the flag and I think you&#8217;ll find everything compiles just fine.<BR>
<BR>
Hope that helps<BR>

I am trying to compile a piece of code (NPB) under OpenMPI and I am having a problem with specifying the right library. Possibly something I need to define in a LD_LIBRARY_PATH statement?<BR>
<BR>
Using Gnu mpich, the line looked like this...<BR>
<BR>
FMPI_LIB &nbsp;= -L/opt/mpich/gnu/lib/ -lmpich<BR>
<BR>
I tried to replace this with...<BR>
<BR>
FMPI_LIB &nbsp;= -L/usr/lib/openmpi/ -llibmpi<BR>
<BR>
to which the make responded...<BR>
mpif90 -O -o ../bin/cg.A.2 cg.o ../common/print_results.o ../common/randdp.o ../common/timers.o -L/usr/lib/openmpi/ -llibmpi<BR>
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -llibmpi<BR>
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status<BR>
<BR>
Wrong library file? Setup or path issue?<BR>
