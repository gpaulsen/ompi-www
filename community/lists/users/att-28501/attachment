    A bit of an update:<br>
    <br>
    I was mistaken when I said users were reporting 1.10.1 was throwing
    an error. The error occurs for 1.6.5 (which I still have to keep on
    my production systems). Users report that they do not see the error
    with 1.10.1. <br>
    <br>
    That being said, I do see references to my GCC 5.2.0 installation in
    the &lt;install dir&gt;/lib/*.la 1.10.1 files and would like to ask
    if I need to worry at all? It seems the way files were named and
    organized in &lt;install dir&gt;/lib changed in 1.7 which may be why
    1.10.1 is working.<br>
    <br>
    Thank you very much for your time,<br>
    David<br>

      Hello,<br>
      <br>
      Is it possible to use a single build of Open MPI against multiple
      versions of GCC if the versions of GCC are from the same release
      series? I was under the assumption that as long as a
      binary-compatible compiler was used, it was possible to "swap out"
      the compiler from underneath Open MPI.<br>
      <br>
      That is the general question I have, but here is the specific
      scenario that prompted it:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>built Open MPI 1.10.1 against GCC 5.2.0 with a directory
          name of openmpi-1.10.1-gcc-5<br>
        </li>
        <li>installed GCC 5.3.0</li>
        <li>removed GCC 5.2.0</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I now have users who are getting errors like the following when
        using mpicxx:<br>
      </p>
      <p>/bin/grep:
        /usr/projects/hpcsoft/toss2/common/gcc/5.2.0/lib/../lib64/libstdc++.la:
        No such file or directory<br>
      </p>
      <p>I can see several references to my previous GCC 5.2.0
        installation in the &lt;install dir&gt;/lib/*.la files,
        including a reference to
        /usr/projects/hpcsoft/toss2/common/gcc/5.2.0/lib/../lib64/libstdc++.la.<br>
      </p>
      <p>This is all disconcerting as users of GCC 5.3.0 were using
        5.3.0's binaries but were getting some 5.2.0 library configs
        before I removed 5.2.0, but no one knew it.<br>
      </p>
      <p>If it should be possible to use a single build of Open MPI with
        multiple binary-compatible compilers, is there a way to fix my
        above situation or prevent it from happening at build time?<br>
      </p>
      <p>Thanks,<br>
        David<br>
