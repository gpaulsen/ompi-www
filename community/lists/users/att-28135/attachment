    I'm trying to run a multi-node job but I want to map all of the
    processes to cores on socket #0 only.<br>
    I'm having a hard time figuring out how to do this, the obvious
    combinations<br>
    <blockquote><tt>mpirun -n  8 -npernode 4 -report-bindings ...</tt><br>
      <tt>mpirun -n  8 -npernode 4 --map-by core -report-bindings ...</tt><br>
      <tt>mpirun -n  8 -npernode 4 -cpu-set S0 -report-bindings ...</tt><br>
      <tt>mpirun -n  8 --map-by ppr:4:node,ppr:4:socket -report-bindings
        ...</tt><br>
      <tt>mpirun -n  8 -npernode 4 -bind-to slot=0:0,2,4,6
        -report-bindings ...</tt><br>
      <tt>mpirun -n  8 -npernode 4 -bind-to slot=0:0,0:2,0:4,0:6
        -report-bindings ...</tt><br>
      <tt>mpirun -n  8 -npernode 4 --map-by core:PE=2 -bind-to core
        -report-bindings ...</tt><br>
    </blockquote>
    all are reported as having conflicting resource requirements.<br>
    Is there a way to specify this on the command-line?<br>
    <br>
    I've looked at the docs on hostfiles &amp; rankfiles, and it looks
    like they require me to hard-code the names of all the nodes I'm
    using.<br>
    To me, this doesn't make sense on modern clusters, why don't they
    just associate an index with each assigned node?<br>
    That way the mapping files would be agnostic of the actual node
    names.<br>
    Thanks,<br>
    <br>
