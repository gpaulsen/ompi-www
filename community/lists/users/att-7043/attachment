<div>No, I don&#39;t have the source code, the application seems to be able to work with openmpi since it has an option openmpi=yes in the command line, but I couldn&#39;t make it to work. Anyway, I think it is not fully supported yet since there is nothing about that option in the user manual</div>

<div>About LAM/MPI I have already read the howto and did a tight integration. The problem is that Msc Nastran in parallel jobs start a new lam environment getting out of control of sge.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I contacted with Nastran and they told that was a LAM/MPI or&nbsp;SGE&nbsp;problem.</div>
