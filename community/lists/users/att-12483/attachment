<p class=MsoNormal>Hi all,<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I posted before about doing a domain decomposition on a 3D
array in C, and this is sort of a follow up to that. &nbsp;I was able to get
the calculations working correctly by performing the calculations on XZ
sub-domains for all Y dimensions of the space. I think someone referred to this
as a &#8220;book.&#8221; In the space.&nbsp; Being that I now have an X
starting and ending point, a Z starting and ending point, and a total number of
X and Z points to visit in each direction during the computation, I am now at
another hanging point. &nbsp;First, some background. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am working on modifying a code that was originally written
to be run serially. That being said, there is a massive amount of object
oriented crap that is making this a total nightmare to work on. All of the
properties that are computed for each point in the 3D mesh are stored in
structures, and those structures are stored in structures, blah blah, it looks
very gross. In order to speed this code up, I was able to pull out the most
computationally sensitive property (potential) and get it set up in this 3D
array that is allocated nicely, etc. The problem is, this code eventually
outputs after all the iterations to a Tecplot format. The code to do this is
very, very contrived. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My idea was to, for the sake of wanting to move on, stuff
back all of these XZ subdomains that I have calculated into a single array on
the first processor, so it can go about its way and do the file output on the
WHOLE domain. I seem to be having problems though, extracting out these SubX *
SubZ * Y sized portions of the original that can be sent to the first
processor. Does anyone have any examples anywhere of code that does something
like that?&nbsp; It appears that my 3D mesh is in X major format in memory, so
I tried to create some loops to extract Y, SubZ sized columns of X to send back
to the zero&#8217;th processor but I haven&#8217;t had much luck yet.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Any tips are appreciated&#8230;thanks! <o:p></o:p></p>
