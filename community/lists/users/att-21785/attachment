<div dir="ltr"><div><div><div>Hi all,<br><br></div>The FAQ has excellent entries on how to schedule on a SGE cluster non-MPI jobs, yet only simple jobs are exemplified. But wnat about jobs that can be run in multithreaded mode, say specifying option -t number_of_threads? In other words, consider a command an esample qsub script:<br>
..........<br></div><div>#$ -pe openmpi 16<br></div><div>..........<br><br>mpirun -np $NSLOTS my_program -t 16 &gt; out_file<br></div><br></div>Will that launch a program to run in 16 threads (as desired) or will this launch 16 instances of a program wiith each instance trying to run in 16 threads (certainly not desired)?<br>
</div>
