Hello All,<br><br>I have been enjoying using Transparent CR in Open MPI for my research !<br>I have few questions regarding working of ompi-restart:<br><br>1. I there a fixed mapping of processes to resources when ompi-restart is done.<br>

<br>2. Is there a way for the user to control it. If I am correct, 
ompi-restart does not accept parameters similar to those in mpirun like 
-npernode, -bynode, etc<br><br>3. Do mpirun and ompi-restart both use same orte components for mapping purpose? <br>
    Can you point me to relevant files in the code which make orte calls for ompi-restart.<br clear="all"><br>Regards,<br><i>Kishor Kharbas</i><br><br>
