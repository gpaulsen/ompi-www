<div dir="ltr"><div class="gmail_signature">Hello,</div><div class="gmail_signature"><br></div><div class="gmail_signature">I have been searching <a href="http://open-mpi.org">open-mpi.org</a> pages and the internet for quite some time now. However, I&#39;m unable to figure out if there is any support for asynchronous message progression (progress threads) in Open MPI 1.8.4. I&#39;d also like to know the configure flag for this if the support is there. I tried  --enable-progress-threads and  --enable-opal-progress-threads but they aren&#39;t being recognized.</div><div class="gmail_signature">I&#39;m fairly new to this so please bear with me if I have missed something obvious.</div><div class="gmail_signature"><br></div><div class="gmail_signature">Thanks,</div><div class="gmail_signature">Kaushal</div>
