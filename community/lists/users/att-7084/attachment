&gt;&gt; I have one cluster without Internet connection. I want to test &nbsp;<br>
&gt;&gt; OpenMPI functions on it. It seems MTT can not be used. Do I have any &nbsp;<br>
&gt;&gt; other choice for the testing?<br>

&gt; You can always run tests manually. &nbsp;MTT is simply our harness for &nbsp;<br>
&gt; automated testing, which *usually* (but not always) involves &nbsp;<br>
&gt; downloading the latest nightly snapshot from the IU web site.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; You can certainly configure MTT to use a local copy of Open MPI and &nbsp;<br>
&gt; not use the IU web nightly snapshot.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; I have tried lamtest. &quot;make -k check&quot; gave a lot of IB related &nbsp;<br>
&gt;&gt; warnings, indicating that my dat.conf file contained invalid entry. &nbsp;<br>
&gt;&gt; Each machine of my cluster has one IB connectX adapter installed. &nbsp;<br>
&gt;&gt; But do not know why lamtest detected that.<br>

&gt; You must have built with udapl support. &nbsp;Open MPI will use as many &nbsp;<br>
&gt; interfaces as you have built for; if you have built support for udapl &nbsp;<br>
&gt; (which I do not believe we build by default on Linux -- you have to &nbsp;<br>
&gt; specifically ask for it to be built because [among other reasons] OMPI &nbsp;<br>
&gt; would prefer to use verbs, not udapl), then we initialize udapl at run &nbsp;<br>
&gt; time and if you have an illegal dat.conf file, then I'm guessing udapl &nbsp;<br>
&gt; is complaining about it. &nbsp;I don't know very much about udapl, so I &nbsp;<br>
&gt; can't give good guidance here (other than suggesting not building &nbsp;<br>
&gt; udapl support and just testing the native verbs support, which is &nbsp;<br>
&gt; where we put all of our effort for Linux/OpenFabrics/Open MPI support).<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; OMPI's udapl support is mainly for Sun, because udapl *is* [currently] &nbsp;<br>
&gt; their high-performance network stack.<br>
