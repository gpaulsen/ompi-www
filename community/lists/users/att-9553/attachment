Dear,<br>
   I developed one application using openmpi in c++. This application should<br>
start internally (by system call) another application which is also<br>
developed in c++ and openmpi. When this external application is called with<br>
C system function the following messages are showed:<br>
<br>
[localhost.localdomain:05275] 00B: Connectio to HNP lost<br>
[localhost.localdomain:05276] 00B: Connectio to HNP lost<br>
[localhost.localdomain:05277] 00B: Connectio to HNP lost<br>
<br>
<br>
Please, could someone explain what is happening in this case?<br>
<br>
<br>
Best,<br>
