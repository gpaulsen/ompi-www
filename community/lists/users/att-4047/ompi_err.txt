**********************************************************************
* It appears that your Fortran 77 compiler is unable to link against
* object files created by your C compiler.  This generally indicates
* either a conflict between the options specified in CFLAGS and FFLAGS
* or a problem with the local compiler installation.  More
* information (including exactly what command was given to the
* compilers and what error resulted when the commands were executed) is
* available in the config.log file in this directory.
