<P><FONT SIZE=2>Hello<BR>
<BR>
I am running on Linux, latest version of mpi built but I've run into a few issues with a program which I am trying to run. It is a widely used open source application called LIGGGHTS so I know the code works and should compile, so I obviously have a setting wrong with MPI. I saw a similar problem in a previous post (2007), but couldn't see how to resolve it as I am quite new to the terminal environment in Unix (always been windows... until now).<BR>
<BR>
So the issue I am getting is the following error...<BR>
<BR>
[Jay@Jay chute_wear]$ mpirun -np 1 lmp_fedora &lt; in.chute_wear<BR>
lmp_fedora: error while loading shared libraries: libmpi_cxx.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory<BR>
<BR>
So I checked where stuff was pointing using the ldd command as in that post and found the following:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; linux-gate.so.1 =&gt;&nbsp; (0x00d10000)<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; libmpi_cxx.so.0 =&gt; not found<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; libmpi.so.0 =&gt; not found<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; libopen-rte.so.0 =&gt; not found<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; libopen-pal.so.0 =&gt; not found<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; libdl.so.2 =&gt; /lib/libdl.so.2 (0x00cbe000)<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; libnsl.so.1 =&gt; /lib/libnsl.so.1 (0x007e6000)<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; libutil.so.1 =&gt; /lib/libutil.so.1 (0x009fa000)<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; libstdc++.so.6 =&gt; /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6 (0x04a02000)<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; libm.so.6 =&gt; /lib/libm.so.6 (0x008a4000)<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; libgcc_s.so.1 =&gt; /lib/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00110000)<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; libpthread.so.0 =&gt; /lib/libpthread.so.0 (0x00550000)<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; libc.so.6 =&gt; /lib/libc.so.6 (0x003b3000)<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x00bfa000)<BR>
<BR>
so it is the open mpi files it isn't linking to. How can i sort this? I shouldn't need to edit code of the executable of LIGGGHTS I've compiled as I know other people are using the same thing so I guess it is to do with the way I installed openMPI. I did a system search and couldn't find a file called libmpi* anywhere... so my guess is that I've incorrectly installed. I have tried several ways, but could you tell me how to fix it/ install correctly? (embaressing if it is to do with a correct install...)<BR>
<BR>
Thanks<BR>
