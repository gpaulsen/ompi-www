Hi,<br>
I&#39;ve a problem with shared memory. When my application runs using pure 
message passing (one process for node), it terminates and returns 
correct results. When 2 processes share a node and use shared memory for
 exchanges messages, my application don&#39;t terminate. At shell I write 
&quot;mpirun -nolocal --mca self,sm,tcp ... (forces interface to eth0)... -np
 (number of processes) executable arguments&quot;.<br>
<br>
I hope you help me.<br>
I thank you.<br>
Michele
