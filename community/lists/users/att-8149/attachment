I am trying to use the mpi_bcast function in fortran.&nbsp; I am using open-mpi-v-1.2.7<br><br>Say x is a real variable of size 100. np =100&nbsp; I try to bcast this to all the processors. <br><br>I use call mpi_bcast(x,np,mpi_real,0,ierr) <br>
<br>When I do this and try to print the value from the resultant processor, exactly half the values gets broadcast.&nbsp; In this case, I get 50 correct values in the resultant processor and rest are junk.&nbsp; Same happened when i tried with np=20.. Exactly 10 values gets populated and rest are junk.!!<br>
<br>ps: I am running this in a single processor. ( Just testing purposes ) I run this with &quot;mpirun -np 4 &lt;filename&gt; &quot;<br><br clear="all">Cheerio,<br>Gim<br>
