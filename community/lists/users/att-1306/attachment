Hi,<br>  I am a newbie to OpenMPI.<br>  Can anyone say how the support for MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE is implemented in openMPI?<br>  <br>  Is thread safety completely provided in openMPI? or does it still has some bugs?<br>  I am currently using LAM/MPI.But i need concurrent threads making MPI  calls. So i am planning to move to another implementation of MPI. Can i  choose openMPI?<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, is "fork"(for child preoces creation) still a no-no in&nbsp;  openMPI too?&nbsp; Can a child process(forked) make concurrent MPI  calls along with its parent ? <br>  <br>  <br>  <p>__________________________________________________<br>Do You Yahoo!?<br>Tired of spam?
