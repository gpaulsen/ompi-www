Jeff,
<div><br>
</div>
<div>We have 3 Rocks Clusters, while there is a default MPI with each</div>
<div>Rocks Release, it is often behind the latest production release as</div>
<div>you note.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>We typically install whatever OpenMPI version we want in a shared space</div>
<div>and ignore the default installed with Rocks. &nbsp;Sometimes there standard</div>
<div>Linux libraries that can be a bit out of date which may be registered as</div>
<div>&quot;can't finds&quot; in the configuration and/or buiild of OpenMPI, but there usually an&nbsp;</div>
<div>easy go around. &nbsp;As far as 'closely intertwined' goes, I would say that</div>
<div>is an exaggeration. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>It does mean some extra work for someone ... around here is it me ... ;-) ...</div>

<b>Subject:</b> [OMPI users] How closely tied is a specific release of OpenMPI to the host operating system and other system software?<br>
</font><br>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><font size="2" face="sans-serif">I use OpenMPI on a variety of platforms: &nbsp;stand-alone servers running Solaris on sparc boxes and Linux (mostly CentOS) on AMD/Intel boxes, also Linux (again CentOS) on large clusters of AMD/Intel boxes. &nbsp;These platforms
 all have some version of the 1.3 OpenMPI stream. &nbsp;I recently requested an upgrade on all systems to 1.4.3 (for production work) and 1.5.1 (for experimentation). &nbsp;I'm getting a lot of push back from the SysAdmin folks claiming that OpenMPI is closely intertwined
 with the specific version of the operating system and/or other system software (i.e., Rocks on the clusters). &nbsp;I need to know if they are telling me the truth or if they're just making excuses to avoid the work. &nbsp;To state my question another way: &nbsp;Apparently
 each release of Linux and/or Rocks comes with some version of OpenMPI bundled in. &nbsp;Is it dangerous in some way to upgrade to a newer version of OpenMPI? &nbsp;Thanks in advance for any insight anyone can provide.</font>
