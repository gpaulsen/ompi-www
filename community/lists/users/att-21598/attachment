<div><span><span>Thanks Ralph.&nbsp; I have a Mac OS X 10.6.8 laptop where I

open-mpi 1.2.8 and open-mpi 1.6.4 with the vpn connected without any problem,

the existence of the vpn interface alone doesn't explain the problem.

The process is hanging trying to open a TCP connection back to mpirun. I would
have thought that excluding the vpn interface would help, but it could be that
there is still some interference from the vpn software itself - as you probably
know, vpn generally tries to restrict connections.

I don't recall seeing this behavior with my laptop (which also runs with a
Cisco vpn), but I'll check it again in the morning and let you know.

&gt;  I am having a problem on my linux desktop where mpi_init hangs for
approximately 64 seconds if I have my vpn client connected but runs immediately
if I disconnect the vpn. I've picked through the FAQ and Google but have failed
to come up with a solution.
&gt; 
&gt; Some potentially relevant information: I am using Open MPI 1.4.3 under
ubuntu 12.04.1 and Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client. (I have also downloaded
openmpi 1.6.4 and built it from source but believe it behaves the same
way.)
&gt; 
&gt; Some potentially irrelevant information: I believe SSH tunneling is
disabled by the vpn.  While the vpn is connected, ifconfig shows an extra
interface (cscotun0 with inet addr:10.248.17.27 that shows up in the
contact.txt file:
&gt; 
&gt; wt217:~/wrk/mpi&gt; cat
/tmp/openmpi-sessions-dab143@wt217_0/29142/contact.txt

&gt; 22001
&gt; 
&gt; The code is simply
&gt; 
&gt; #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
&gt; #include &lt;mpi.h&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; int main(int argc, char** argv)
&gt; {
&gt;     MPI_Init(&amp;argc, &amp;argv);
&gt;     MPI_Finalize();
&gt;     return 0;
&gt; }
&gt; 
&gt; I compile it using "mpicc -g mpi_hello.c -o mpi_hello" and
execute it using "mpirun -d -v ./mpi_hello". (The problem occurs
whether or not I asked for more than one processor.) With verbosity on, I
get the following output:

&gt; 
&gt; The code hangs for approximately 6! 4 second s after the line that reads
"tmp: /tmp".
&gt; 
&gt; If I attach gdb to the process during this time, the stack trace
(attached) shows that the pause is in __GI___poll in
/sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/poll.c:83.
&gt; 
&gt; If I add "-mca oob_tcp_if_exclude cscotun0", then the
corresponding address for that vpn interface no longer shows up in contact.txt,
but the problem remains. I also add "-mca btl ^cscotun0 -mca
btl_tcp_if_exclude cscotun0" with no effect.
&gt; 
&gt; Any idea what is hanging this up or how I can get more information as to
what is going on during the pause? I assume connecting the vpn has caused
mpi_init to look for something that isn't available and that eventually times
out, but I don't know what.
&gt; 
&gt; Output from ompi_info and the gdb stack trace is attached.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
