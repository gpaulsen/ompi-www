Hi Raymond,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for your reply. Actually I have installed lam previously. When I completely removed the mpirun from the /usr/bin and set mpirun to this openmpi path its working correctly.<br>Ramya<br>

Hi,<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; I have installed openmpi-1.3. When I checked for the example programs,<br>
the output shows only rank 0 of size 1 for 2 processors. When I gave the<br>
command: *mpirun -hostfile node -np 2 hello_c*<br>
the output is<br>
Hello, world, I am 0 of 1<br>
Hello, world, I am 0 of 1<br>
<br>
In my node file, I have<br>
*IP address* slots=2 max_slots=2<br>
I don&#39;t know why it is not giving as 0 of 2 and 1 of 2.<br>

Other than the text output, can you confirm that this is happening? &nbsp;I&#39;m no expert, but as a sanity check, I would put an infinite loop after printing &quot;hello, world&quot;. &nbsp;Then opening another terminal and run &quot;top&quot;. &nbsp;I&#39;m not sure if all top&#39;s are the same, but I would hit &quot;f&quot; to include more fields and then &quot;J&quot; to include the &quot;Last used cpu&quot;. &nbsp;Check the help manual for your top if its different for you. &nbsp;On my top, this information is not included by default. &nbsp;Then return to the previous screen.<br>

<br>
Ideally, you should see two processes running on your computer. &nbsp;One on processor &quot;0&quot; and the other on &quot;1&quot;. &nbsp;Can you confirm this is not the case and both are set to &quot;0&quot;?<br>
