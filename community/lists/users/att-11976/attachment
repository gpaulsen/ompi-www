Hi Laurence,<br><br>I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s as bad as a deadly sin, but for us parallel writes are a huge problem and we get complete garbage in the file. Take a look at:<font size="2"><br><br>Implementing MPI-IO Atomic Mode and Shared File Pointers Using MPI One-Sided Communication, <strong style="font-weight: normal;">
Robert Latham,</strong>Robert Ross<strong>, </strong>Rajeev Thakur, </font><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2"><i>International Journal of High Performance Computing Applications</i>, <b>21</b>, 132 (2007).<br>

<br>They describe an implemenation of a &quot;mutex&quot; like object in MPI. If you protect writes to the file with an exclusive lock you can serialize the writes and make use of NFS&#39;s close to open cache coherence.<br>

I have a question concerning having many processors in a mpi job all<br>
write to the same file -- not using mpi calls but with standard<br>
fortran I/O. I know that this can lead to consistency issues, but it<br>
can also lead to OS issues with some flavors of nfs.<br>
<br>
At least in fortran, there is nothing &quot;wrong&quot; with doing this. My<br>
question is whether this is &quot;One of the Seven Deadly Sins&quot; of mpi<br>
programming, or just frowned on. (That is, it should be OK even if it<br>
leads to nonsense files, and not lead to OS issues.) If it is a sin, I<br>
would appreciate a link to where this is spelt out in some &quot;official&quot;<br>
document or similar.<br>
