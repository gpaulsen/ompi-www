    <p>Hi,</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>in your .bashrc, Open MPI environment (PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH)
      is set at the very end.</p>
    <p>i do not know who invokes mpicc, but it is very likely invoked
      *before* the environment is set.</p>
    <p>/* note this might not be the mpicc you expect */</p>
    <p>i would first double check <br>
    </p>
    ~/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-v3.0+/etc/bashrc<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    note if you configure Open MPI with
    --enable-mpirun-prefix-by-default, you will not have to set
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH anymore.<br>
    <br>
    Cheers,<br>
    <br>

      <div dir="ltr">Hello Everyone,<br>
        <br>
        I have attempted to upgrade my Open MPI to version 1.10.2
        however after following the build steps on the FAQ page
        (<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=building">https://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=building</a>) I receive the
        following error at the top of every terminal I open, "mpicc:
        error while loading shared libraries: libopen-pal.so.13: cannot
        open shared object file: No such file or directory". I have
        attached a compressed folder (.zip) that helps explain
        step-by-step what I did during installation. If anyone could
        spot what I did wrong or what I should try next to fix this
        problem I would greatly appreciate the help. Thank you to
        everyone in advance.<br>
        <br>
        All the best,<br>
        Blair<br>
