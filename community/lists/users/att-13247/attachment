<br><u>rankfile</u><br>rank 0=10.16.71.1 slot=0<br><br>I launched my mpi app using,<br><br>$ mpirun -np 1 -rf rankfile appname<br><br>I can run the application on Intel dual-core machine with Linux based OS nicely. But i can&#39;t run it on single core machine(P4).<br>
The execution terminates specifying a problem of slot number. What is the reason for this? A bug or problem of the slot number I specified.(I tried by using rank 0=10.16.71.1 slot=p0:0 but it too failed)<br>Please help me.<br>
<br>Thanks a lot....<br><br>
