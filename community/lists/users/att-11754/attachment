Hi!<br><br>I would like to know if someone could help me with the following error:<br><br>[fenrir][[9567,1],1][../../../../../../ompi/mca/btl/tcp/btl_tcp_frag.c:216:mca_btl_tcp_frag_recv] mca_btl_tcp_frag_recv: readv failed: Connection reset by peer (104)<br>
<br>I am trying to run the hpcc program in a beowulf type cluster with 2,3 and 4 machines. When I use 10.000 problems and up it gives me this error. Any one know what could be this? and how can I solve this problem.<br><br>
I am using Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic Koala, libopenmpi1.3.<br><br>Thank you!<br>
