We had a nice chat about this on the OpenRTE telecon this morning. The
<br>
question of what to do with multiple prefix&#39;s has been a long-running issue,
<br>
most recently captured in bug trac report #497. The problem is that prefix
<br>
is intended to tell us where to find the ORTE/OMPI executables, and
<br>
therefore is associated with a node - not an app_context. What we haven&#39;t
<br>
been able to define is an appropriate notation that a user can exploit to
<br>
tell us the association.
<br>
</p><p>This issue has arisen on several occasions where either (a) users have
<br>
heterogeneous clusters with a common file system, so the prefix must be
<br>
adjusted on each *type* of node to point to the correct type of binary; and
<br>
(b) for whatever reason, typically on rsh/ssh clusters, users have installed
<br>
the binaries in different locations on some of the nodes. In this latter
<br>
case, the reports have been from homogeneous clusters, so the *type* of
<br>
binary was never the issue - it just wasn&#39;t located where we expected.
<br>
</p><p>Sun&#39;s solution is (I believe) what most of us would expect - they locate
<br>
their executables in the same relative location on all their nodes. The
<br>
binary in that location is correct for that local architecture. This
<br>
requires, though, that the &quot;prefix&quot; location not be on a common file system.
<br>
</p><p>Unfortunately, that isn&#39;t the case with LANL&#39;s roadrunner, nor can we expect
<br>
that everyone will follow that sensible approach :-). So we need a notation
<br>
to support the &quot;exception&quot; case where someone needs to truly specify prefix
<br>
versus node(s).
<br>
</p><p>We discussed a number of options, including auto-detecting the local arch
<br>
and appending it to the specified &quot;prefix&quot; and several others. After
<br>
discussing them, those of us on the call decided that adding a field to the
<br>
hostfile that specifies the prefix to use on that host would be the best
<br>
solution. This could be done on a cluster-level basis, so - although it is
<br>
annoying to create the data file - at least it would only have to be done
<br>
once.
<br>
</p><p>Again, this is the exception case, so requiring a little inconvenience seems
<br>
a reasonable thing to do.
<br>
</p><p>Anyone have heartburn and/or other suggestions? If not, we might start to
<br>
play with this next week. We would have to do some small modifications to
<br>
the RAS, RMAPS, and PLS components to ensure that any multi-prefix info gets
<br>
correctly propagated and used across all platforms for consistent behavior.
