<p>Yeah bummers, but something tells me it might not be OpenMPI's fault. Here's why:</p>
<p></p>
<p>1- The tech that takes care of these machines told me that he gets RTC errors on bootup (the cpu borads are apprantly &quot;out of sync&quot; since the clocks aren't set correctly).</p>
<p>2- There is also a possibility that the prior admin did not put in a &quot;stable&quot; firmware version.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So if any Sun guru can help out by telling me which command or point to a quick HOWTO for resolvin these clock issues, it would be greatly appreciated (our analyst is overloaded and he would not be able to justify the 3 days of reading up docs just to satisfy my running parallel code problems ;P)</p>
<p></p>
<p>3- I realised that the OS is not booted in 64 O_o!! (not that this has to do with OpenMPI bombing):</p>

<p></p>
<p>4- LAM-MPI 7.1.1 also bombs, but it does so at a much higher processor count (OpenMPI bombs at 5, LAM-MPI bombs around 10, but it <span style="text-decoration:underline">vraies</span>).</p>
<p></p>
<p>As for the questions regarding OpenMPI build, I just recently built 1.1 with the same basic configure options with the exact same results (clean cache).</p>
<p></p>
<p>So, I guess this one is on pause untill I have the confirmation that the clocks on the processor boards are set correctly. There is one this that bothers me though, one of the machines has only 1 processor board (4 procs) and I still get the error on that machine if I go over 4 pcrosesses...how can a board be out of sync with itself??</p>

<p>PS: I am at liberty of providing the source code if anyone wants it.</p>

<p>&gt; Just to be sure -- you had a clean config.cache file before you ran configure, right?  (e.g., the file didn't exist -- just to be sure it didn't get potentially erroneous values from a previous run of configure)  Also, FWIW, it's not necessary to specify --enable-ltdl-convenience; that should be automatic.</p>
<p>&gt;  </p>
<p>&gt; If you had a clean configure, we *suspect* that this might be due to alignment issues on Solaris 64 bit platforms, but thought that we might have had a pretty good handle on it in 1.1.  Obviously we didn't solve everything.  Bonk.</p>
<p>&gt;  </p>
<p>&gt; Did you get a corefile, perchance?  If you could send a stack trace, that would be most helpful.</p>
