Hello!<br><br>I am using OpenMPI in combination with the boost libraries (especially boost::asio) and came across a weird interaction. When I use asio to send a message via TCP, some messages do not arrive at the server.<br>

<br>The effect is exhibited when I send a message from the tcp client to the server after calling MPI::Init();<br>If I remove this line, it works as intended.<br><br>Is this interaction known? If so, is there a workaround or something I can do to use this?<br>

<br>Thanks,<br>Hannes<br>
