<br><div class="gmail_quote">Hi all<br><br>We have been using OpenMPI for many years with Ubuntu on our 20-node cluster. Each node has 2 quad cores, so we usually run up to 8 processes on each node up to a maximum of 160 processes.<br>

<br>However, we just upgraded the cluster to Ubuntu 11.04 with Open MPI 1.4.3 and and have come across a strange behavior where mpi programs run perfectly well when confined to one node but hangs during communication across multiple nodes. We have no idea why and would like some help in debugging this. A small MPI test program is attached and typical output shown below.<br>

<br>Hope someone can help us<br>Cheers and thanks<br>Ole Nielsen<br><br>-------------------- Test output across two nodes (This one hangs) --------------------------<br>
