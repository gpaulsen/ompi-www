&gt; Recompile your own version of openmpi in a local directory, set your

mpicxx --showme should show you the exact command that Open MPI's  
wrapper compiler is using to compile your application.  There should  
already be an explicit -I there for where OMPI's mpi.h resides.  If  
that's the case, the compiler should look there *first* for mpi.h,  
not /usr/local/include.  Consider following example:

- I created include-test.c which just does an "#include
&lt;stdio.h&gt;".
- If I run this through the preprocessor, you can see that it's  
getting /usr/include/stdio.h:

[6:09] svbu-mpi:~/tmp % cat include-test.c
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
[6:09] svbu-mpi:~/tmp % gcc -E include-test.c | head
# 1 "include-test.c"
# 1 "&lt;built-in&gt;"
# 1 "&lt;command line&gt;"
# 1 "include-test.c"
# 1 "/usr/include/stdio.h" 1 3 4
# 28 "/usr/include/stdio.h" 3 4
# 1 "/usr/include/features.h" 1 3 4
# 319 "/usr/include/features.h" 3 4
# 1 "/usr/include/sys/cdefs.h" 1 3 4
# 320 "/usr/include/features.h" 2 3 4

- But now I make my-include-dir/stdio.h with a single line in it
- Then I recompile with an explicit -I for that directory and you can  
see that the compiler picks up that stdio.h, not /usr/include/stdio.h

[6:09] svbu-mpi:~/tmp % cat my-include-dir/stdio.h
typedef int foo;
[6:09] svbu-mpi:~/tmp % gcc -E -Imy-include-dir include-test.c | head
# 1 "include-test.c"
# 1 "&lt;built-in&gt;"
# 1 "&lt;command line&gt;"
# 1 "include-test.c"
# 1 "my-include-dir/stdio.h" 1
typedef int foo;
# 2 "include-test.c" 2
[6:10] svbu-mpi:~/tmp %

Are you sure that OMPI's mpicxx.h is picking up MPICH's mpi.h?  If so, 

how?  Did you run it through the preprocessor (perhaps similar to  
above), or step through a debugger or something?
