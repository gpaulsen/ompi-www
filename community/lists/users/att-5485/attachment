Now of course, if one limit itself to very regular applications (such
as the one presented in the paper), where the matrices involved in the
computation are well conditioned (such as in the paper), and if you
only use MPI_DOUBLE (\cite{same_paper}), and finally if you only expect
to run over slow Ethernet (1Gbs) (\cite{same_paper_again})... then yes
one might get some benefit.

Yes, you are probably right that its not worth the effort in general
and <br>
especially not in HPC environments where you have very fast network. <br>
<br>
But I can think of (rather important) special cases where it is
important <br>
<br>
- non HPC environments with slow network: beowulf clusters and/or <br>
&nbsp; internet + normal PCs where you use existing workstations and network
<br>
&nbsp; for computations.<br>
- communication/io-bound computations where you transfer <br>
&nbsp; large redundant datasets between nodes<br>
<br>
So it would be nice to be able to turn on the compression (for spefic <br>
communicators and/or data transfers) when you need it. <br>

I read from somewhere that OpenMPI supports
    <br>
some kind of data compression but I couldn't find
    <br>
any information about it.
    <br>
    <br>
Is this true and how it can be used?
    <br>
    <br>
Does anyone have any experiences about using it?
    <br>
    <br>
Is it possible to use compression in just some
    <br>
subset of communications (communicator
    <br>
specific compression settings)?
    <br>
    <br>
In our MPI application we are transferring large
    <br>
amounts of sparse/redundant data that compresses
    <br>
very well. Also my initial tests showed significant
    <br>
improvements in performance.
    <br>
    <br>
There are also articles that suggest that compression
    <br>
should be used [1].
