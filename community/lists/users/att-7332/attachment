Well, the version number 8.04.1 was the version number of the Ubuntu JeOS.<br><br>Very similar to the Ubuntu Server but with a optimized kernel for VmWare.<br><br>see the link here.<br><a href="http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/jeos/releases/8.04.1/release/">http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/jeos/releases/8.04.1/release/</a><br>
<br>well i searched the repositories, but could not find anything for a few days. so i thought that it has to be installed using the tar.gz file.<br><br>thanks for pointing out that is there in the repos.<br><br><br>Well i am actually waiting for the Debian Lenny release. Once my testing on VmWare is over. My plan is to use real machines. And definitely it will be Lenny.<br>
<br><br>Thanks<br><br clear="all">Regards<br><br>Venu Gopal<br>

</div>Open MPi is packaged for Debian and hence part of Ubuntu. So just do:<br>
<br>
 &nbsp; $ sudo apt-get install libopenmpi1 linopenmpi-dev openmpi-bin openmpi-doc<br>
<br>
In Ubuntu 8.10, this gives you Open MPI <a href="http://1.2.7." target="_blank">1.2.7.</a> In Ubuntu 8.4, you&#39;re at a<br>
slightly older version so I suggest upgrading.<br>
<br>
In case you really want 1.2.8, by far the easiest way (and also most general)<br>
is to just grab the Debian source from &#39;Debian unstable&#39; and rebuild on your<br>
system to match your libraries. That can be quasi-automated, see &#39;apt-get<br>
source&#39; and use google as this is getting off-topic for this list.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps,<br>
