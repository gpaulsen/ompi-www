<div style="word-wrap: break-word;">Hmm....if you are willing to keep trying, could you perhaps let it run for a brief time, ctrl-z it, and then do an ls on a directory from a process that has already terminated? The pids will be in order, so just look for an early number (not mpirun or the parent, of course).<div>

<br></div><div>It would help if you could give us the contents of a directory from a child process that has terminated - would tell us what subsystem is failing to properly cleanup.<br></div></div></blockquote><div><br>Ok, so I Ctrl-Z the master. In&nbsp; /tmp/.private/nbock/openmpi-sessions-nbock@mujo_0 I now have only one directory<br>

<br>/tmp/.private/nbock/openmpi-sessions-nbock@mujo_0/857<br><br>I can't find that PID though. mpirun has PID 4230, orted does not exist, master is 4231, and slave is 4275. When I "fg" master and Ctrl-Z it again, slave has a different PID as expected. I Ctrl-Z'ed in iteration 68, there are 70 sequentially numbered directories starting at 0. Every directory contains another directory called "0". There is nothing in any of those directories. I see for instance:<br>

<br>/tmp/.private/nbock/openmpi-sessions-nbock@mujo_0/857 $ ls -lh 70<br>total 4.0K<br>drwx------ 2 nbock users 4.0K Dec&nbsp; 2 14:41 0<br><br>and<br><br>nbock@mujo /tmp/.private/nbock/openmpi-sessions-nbock@mujo_0/857 $ ls -lh 70/0/<br>

total 0<br><br>I hope this information helps. Did I understand your question correctly?<br><br>nick<br><br></div></div>
