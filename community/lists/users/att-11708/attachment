Hi,<br>
<br>
I can only speak to Sun's use of uDAPL as it relates to MPI.<br>
<br>
>From what I can tell Sun is the only group interested in the uDAPL BTL
in Open MPI at this point. In contrast, Open MPI has many active
members interested in the development of the OpenIB BTL which uses the
user verbs protocol. Because of the community commitment Sun's MPI
product based on Open MPI, ClusterTools, will also be moving away from
the uDAPL BTL in favor of the OpenIB BTL. As such we expect our
development of the uDAPL BTL to drop off. <br>

  <pre wrap="">This is a question for Sun to answer; they've been the primary/only drivers behind Open MPI's udapl support for quite a while.

    <pre wrap="">Hi all, 

I am new to Open MPI mailing list. Just started using it for our proprietary interconnect

which uses uDAPL1.2 as underling network.

As our experience with other open source MPI2 implementation libraries, they are deprecating udapl ADI.

and giving more n more support/enhancement to gen2 ADI.

So we are thinking to move to OpenMPI, before that we want to confirm these thing with you people.

Thanking,
