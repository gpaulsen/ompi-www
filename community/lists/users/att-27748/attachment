    Hi, Nathan<br>
    <br>
    I have compiled 2.x with your patch. I must say it works _much_
    better with your changes. I have no idea how you figured that out! A
    short table with my bandwidth calculations (MB/s)<br>
    <br>
                    PROT_READ        PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE<br>
    1.10.0            2500                        5700<br>
    2.x+patch     4800-5200                5700<br>
    <br>
    That is not a very thorough study, but essentially I was getting
    2500MB/s with read-only shm. With your patch it is somewhat shaky
    (very rarely I get 2500 also), but most of the time it is around
    5000MB/s. <br>
    <br>
    Seems mmaping the memory read-write still yields marginally better
    results. Again, I do not have very solid data to support it - just a
    bunch of runs.<br>
    <br>
    Do you have an idea as to why such performance difference exists?<br>
    <br>
    Thanks a lot!<br>
    <br>
    Marcin<br>

There was a bug in that patch that affected IB systems. Updated patch:

I have a branch with the changes available at:

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://github.com/hjelmn/ompi.git">https://github.com/hjelmn/ompi.git</a>

in the mpool_update branch. If you prefer you can apply this patch to
either a 2.x or a master tarball.

Let me know if this resolves the performance issues.

 We register the memory with the NIC for both read and write access. This
 may be the source of the slowdown. We recently added internal support to
 allow the point-to-point layer to specify the access flags but the
 openib btl does not yet make use of the new support. I plan to make the
 necessary changes before the 2.0.0 release. I should have them complete
 later this week. I can send you a note when they are ready if you would
 like to try it and see if it addresses the problem.

 Thanks, Dave.

 I have verified the memory locality and IB card locality, all's fine.

 Quite accidentally I have found that there is a huge penalty if I mmap the
 shm with PROT_READ only. Using PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE yields good results,
 although I must look at this further. I'll report when I am certain, in case
 sb finds this useful.

 Is this an OS feature, or is OpenMPI somehow working differently? I don't
 suspect you guys write to the send buffer, right? Even if you would there
 would be a segfault. So I guess this could be OS preventing any writes to
 the pointer that introduced the overhead?

 Hello, everyone

 I am struggling a bit with IB performance when sending data from a POSIX shared memory region (/dev/shm). The memory is shared among many MPI processes within the same compute node. Essentially, I see a bit hectic performance, but it seems that my code it is roughly twice slower than when using a usual, malloced send buffer.

 It may have to do with NUMA effects and the way you're allocating/touching your shared memory vs. your private (malloced) memory.  If you have a multi-NUMA-domain system (i.e., any 2+ socket server, and even some single-socket servers) then you are likely to run into this sort of issue.  The PCI bus on which your IB HCA communicates is almost certainly closer to one NUMA domain than the others, and performance will usually be worse if you are sending/receiving from/to a "remote" NUMA domain.

 "lstopo" and other tools can sometimes help you get a handle on the situation, though I don't know if it knows how to show memory affinity.  I think you can find memory affinity for a process via "/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/numa_maps".  There's lots of info about NUMA affinity here: <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2513149">https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2513149</a>
