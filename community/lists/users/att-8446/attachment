<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" ><tr><td valign="top" style="font: inherit;">Hi there:<br><br>I'm trying to install an old version of openmpi 1.1.1
on a 32 bit cluster and running a program with it.&nbsp; This program runs fine for another 64 bit
cluster which has openmpi 1.1.1 installed, but when running this on the 32 bit cluster, I get the
following error:<br><br>/var/spool/pbs/mom_priv/jobs/282832.borg.SC:
