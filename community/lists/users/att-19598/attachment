Thanks Jeff,<br><br>I was looking more into this scenario :<br><br>if (rank ==0){<br>        MPI_Send(&amp;tmp,2048, MPI_INT, 1,123, myComm);<br>        MPI_Recv(&amp;tmp2,2048, MPI_INT, 1,321,<br>                 MPI_COMM_WORLD, MPI_STATUS_IGNORE);<br>
  }<br>  if (rank == 1){<br>        MPI_Send(&amp;tmp1,2048, MPI_INT, 0,321, MPI_COMM_WORLD);<br>        MPI_Recv(&amp;tmp3,2048, MPI_INT, 0,123, myComm, MPI_STATUS_IGNORE);<br>      <br>  }<br>  <br>This scenario in a normal case will lead to a deadlock. But I was wondering whether multiple communicators will solve this issue, but apparently it doesn&#39;t.<br>
I tried doing sends and receives on different threads, but that did not help too. So  I was wondering if there is a way to handle this in MPI without using non-blocking sends and receives. <br><br>Thanks<br>Ramesh<br><br>

&gt; I was wondering is there a way to communicate between two processes with two different communicators simultaneously in MPI? Like having two channels for communication?<br>
<br>
</div>I&#39;m not quite sure what you&#39;re asking.  Are you asking if it&#39;s possible to have 2 processes share 2 entirely different communicators (and use both of them for communication)?<br>
<br>
If so, yes.  Any set of processes can have any number of shared communicators.  For example:<br>
<br>
   MPI_Comm foo;<br>
   MPI_Comm_dup(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &amp;foo);<br>
<br>
Now foo will be a duplicate of MPI_COMM_WORLD, but with a different communication context (so that messages sent on MCW won&#39;t be received on foo, and vice versa).  Hence, you can send a message on MCW to any peer in that communicator, but you can also send a message on foo to any peer in that communicator.<br>

<br>
Note, however, that sending multiple messages on different communicators to the same peer doesn&#39;t (usually) expand your available bandwidth.  Think of communicators (and tags, too), as message matching mechanisms rather than bandwidth-multiplying mechanisms.  For example, you might send control messages on &quot;foo&quot;, but send data messages on MPI_COMM_WORLD.<br>

<br>
Hope that helps.<br>
