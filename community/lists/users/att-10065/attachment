<div> </div>You are absolutely correct. I am using  rsh/ssh based start-up mechanism.<br><br><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;">
A batch/queueing system might be able to tell you whether a remote computer is still accessible.<br>
</blockquote><div><br>Right now I don&#39;t have any Idea about batch/queuing system, I will explore about that also. And I think you mean it before launching the jobs.</div><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;">

I think that MPI is not the proper mechanism to achieve what you want. PVM or, maybe better, direct socket programming will probably serve you more.</blockquote><div><br>I will think about these also.<br><br>I have already spent significant amount of time in LAM-MPI and OPEN-MPI and due to lack of time I don&#39;t want to switch to another mechanism. Anyway Open MPI is doing great for me, Atleast 80% what I want.  <br>
