<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;">Dear all,<br><br>As I mentioned, when I mpiruned an application with the parameter &quot;np = 150(or bigger)&quot;, the application who used the MPI_Alltoallv function would carsh. The problem would recur no matter how many nodes we used. <br>

<br>The edition of OpenMPI: 1.4.1 or 1.4.3<br>The OS: linux redhat 2.6.32<br><br>BTW, my nodes had enough memory to run the application, and the MPI_Alltoall function worked well at my environment.<br>Did anybody meet the same problem? Thanks.<br>
