    I've run into a problem involving accessing a remote host via a
    router and I think need to understand how opmpi determines ip
    addresses.&nbsp; If there's anything posted on this subject, please point
    me to it.<br>
    <br>
    Here's the problem:<br>
    <br>
    I've installed opmpi (1.4.3) on a remote system (an Amazon ec2
    instance).&nbsp; If the local system I'm working on has a static ip
    address (and a direct connection to the internet), there's no
    problem.&nbsp; But if the local system accesses the internet through a
    router (which itself gets it's ip via dhcp), a call to runmpi
    command hangs.<br>
    <br>
    This is not firewall problem - I've disabled the firewalls on all
    the system that are involved (and the router).<br>
    <br>
    It is also not an ssh problem.&nbsp; The ssh connection is being made and
    it appears that the application has been launched on the remote
    system.&nbsp; After the runmpi command has been launched locally, a ps on
    the remote system shows a process<br>
    <blockquote>orted --daemonize -mca ess env -mca orte_ess_jobid
      1187643392 -mca orte_ess_vpid 1 -mca orte_ess_num_procs 2
      --hnp-uri 1187643392.0;tcp://192.168.1.101:35272<br>
    </blockquote>
    <br>
    While I don't really understand the orted process, I assume this
    indicates that a command to execute an app has been received and
    that opmpi is trying to run it.<br>
    <br>
    I suspect that the problem is related to the '--hnp-uri ...
    tcp://192.168.1.101' argument.&nbsp; 192.168.1.101 is the address of my
    local system on my local network (attached to the router), which of
    course is not accessible over the net.&nbsp; It appears that opmpi is
    transmitting the local (static) ip address to the remote host.<br>
    <br>
    It would help to know how opmpi determines and distributes IP
    addresses.&nbsp; And if there's any way to control this.<br>
    <br>
    Any thoughts on dealing with this would be greatly appreciated.<br>
    <br>
    Thanks,<br>
