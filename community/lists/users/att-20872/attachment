I&#39;m trying to build openmpi with support for BLCR plus qlogic infiniband (plus grid engine).  Everything seems to compile OK and checkpoints are taken but whenever I try to restore a checkpoint I get the following error:<div>

- do_mmap(&lt;file&gt;, 00002aaab18c7000, 0000000000001000, ...) failed: ffffffffffffffea<div>- mmap failed: /dev/ipath</div><div>- thaw_threads returned error, aborting. -22</div><div>- thaw_threads returned error, aborting. -22</div>

<div>Restart failed: Invalid argument</div><div><br></div></div><div>This occurs whether I specify psm or openib as the btl.</div><div><br></div><div>This looks like the sort of thing I would expect to be handled by the blcr supporting code in openmpi.  So I guess I have a couple ofquestions.</div>

<div>1)Are Infiniband and BLCR support in openmpi compatible?</div><div>2)Are there any special tricks necessary to get them working together.</div><div><br></div>
</blockquote></div>A third question occurred to me that may be relevant.  How do I verify that my openmpi install has blcr support built in?  I would have thought this would mean that either mpiexec or binaries built with mpicc would have libcr linked in.  However running ldd doesn&#39;t report this in either case.  I&#39;m setting LD_PRELOAD to point to it but I would have thought openmpi would need to register a callback with blcr and it would be easier to do this if the library were linked in rather than trying to detect whether it has been LD_PRELOADed.  I&#39;m building with the following options:</div>
