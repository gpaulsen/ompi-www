<div dir="ltr">Sorry I didn&#39;t get back to your right away.  1) I&#39;m on the digest, 2) not real familiar with git and 3) just learned the hard way how to update the build to work with the latest versions of automake, autoconf, and libtool. :)<div><br></div><div>Anyway, I believe the patch is an improvement.  Looking at it, I can tell you are now checking the first three characters.  I know the plan is to go to 1.9 and then 2.0, but if the numbering ever went more like the linux kernel into, say, a 2.10.0 release then your number of characters would be off.  Also, doesn&#39;t the current ABI promise allow 1.7 to be compatible with 1.8? </div><div><br></div><div>Personally, I&#39;m fine with the solution, but I wanted to point out the potential shortcoming(s) should an issue arise again.  </div><div><br></div><div>One other thought, maybe this is an case where the code should emit a warning (that could be suppressed with a command line parameter) when the versions aren&#39;t identical?   Certainly if the versions are outside the &quot;allowed&quot; range (whatever you determine that to be) should be an error and a refused connection, but rather than silently accepting mixed versions (which you indicated has caused problems in the past would be to warn of a potential issue (and users could then consciously suppress the warning if they are fine with it).  Food for thought.</div><div><br></div><div>Unfortunately, the patch didn&#39;t actually solve my particular problem (yet, anyway) because the vendor application statically linked 1.8.3 into their executable.  (I honestly didn&#39;t realize it when I made my previous post).  So the code on their side of the connection is still rejecting the connection:</div><div><br></div><div><div>[arwild1@hplcslsp2 ~]$ mpirun -n 6 -H localhost vendor_mpi_app</div><div>[hplcslsp2:23064] [[44148,1],0] tcp_peer_recv_connect_ack: received different version from [[44148,0],0]: 1.8.5rc2 instead of 1.8.3</div><div>[hplcslsp2:23065] [[44148,1],1] tcp_peer_recv_connect_ack: received different version from [[44148,0],0]: 1.8.5rc2 instead of 1.8.3</div><div>[hplcslsp2:23067] [[44148,1],2] tcp_peer_recv_connect_ack: received different version from [[44148,0],0]: 1.8.5rc2 instead of 1.8.3</div><div>[hplcslsp2:23069] [[44148,1],3] tcp_peer_recv_connect_ack: received different version from [[44148,0],0]: 1.8.5rc2 instead of 1.8.3</div><div>[hplcslsp2:23071] [[44148,1],4] tcp_peer_recv_connect_ack: received different version from [[44148,0],0]: 1.8.5rc2 instead of 1.8.3</div><div>-------------------------------------------------------</div><div>Primary job  terminated normally, but 1 process returned</div><div>a non-zero exit code..
