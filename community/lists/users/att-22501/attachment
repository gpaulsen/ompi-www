<p>For information, if you use a batch system such as PbsPro or Torque it can be configured to set up the cpuset for a job and start the job within the cpuset. It will also destroy the cpuset at the end of a job.<br>
Highly useful for job cpu binding as you day and also if you have a machine running many separate jobs where cpusets help isolate jobs and help allocate resources.</p>
