Dear Jeff,<br>
<br>
Thanks for yor reply. I checked and confirmed that my gfortran is
version 4.0.2, so the<br>
test program failed since it does not support real(16).<br>
The log files for configure and make are attached.<br>
It is strange since I am able to use the same configuration and build
OpenMPI successfully<br>
on another SuSE10/AMD 64 computer. Something must be missing.<br>
<br>
Best regards<br>

  <pre wrap="">What concerns me, though, is that Open MPI shouldn't have tried to  
compile support for real(16) in the first place -- our configure  
script should have detected that the compiler didn't support real(16)  
(which, it at least partially did, because the constants seem to have  
a value of -1) and then the generated F90 bindings should not have  
included support for it.

This is why I'd like to see the configure output (etc.) and see what  
happened.

    <pre wrap="">Hi.

To my knowledge you must be using gfortran 4.1 not 4.0 to get access
to large kind support like real(16)

You can verify by trying to compile the following code with gfortran.
This compiles under gfortran 4.1, but I don't
believe it will work under 4.0 since this support was added in 4.1.

program test

real(16) :: x, y
   y = 4.0_16
   x = sqrt(y)
   print *, x
end

I used the following variables:
FC=gfortran
CC=gcc
CXX=g++
F77=gfortran

Any hint on how to solve this problem?  Thanks.
