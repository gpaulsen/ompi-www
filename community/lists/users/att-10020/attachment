Hi all,<br>I&#39;m writing an application which requires sending some variable size of sub matrices to a set of processes by a lead process who holds the original matrix.  Here, the matrices are square matrices and the receiving process doesn&#39;t  know the size of the receiving matrix. In MPI_Bcast, I have seen that we can broadcast a whole matrix. Is there a similar way to do this with a derived data type for the matrices which we can send a matrix without looping the blocks ?.<br>

<br>Thanks,<br>Prasad.<br>-- <br><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/script/Articles/MemberArticles.aspx?amid=3489381" target="_blank">http://www.codeproject.com/script/Articles/MemberArticles.aspx?amid=3489381</a><br>
