<br>
</div>That should be correct (i.e., passing -i8 in FFLAGS and FCFLAGS for OMPI 1.6.x).<br>
<div class="im"><br>
&gt; My question is what are the new prototypes for the MPI calls ?<br>
&gt; specifically<br>
&gt; MPI_RECV<br>
&gt; MPI_Allgathterv<br>
<br>
</div>They&#39;re the same as they&#39;ve always been.<br>
<br>
The magic is that the -i8 flag tells the compiler &quot;make all Fortran INTEGERs be 8 bytes, not (the default) 4.&quot;  So Ralph&#39;s answer was correct in that all the MPI parameters are INTEGERs -- but you can tell the compiler that all INTEGERs are 8 bytes, not 4, and therefore get &quot;large&quot; integers.<br>

<br>
Note that this means that you need to compile your application with -i8, too.  That will make *your* INTEGERs also be 8 bytes, and then you&#39;ll match what Open MPI is doing.<br>
<div class="im"><br>
&gt; I&#39;m curious because some off my local variables get killed (set to null) upon my first call to MPI_RECV.  Typically, this is due (in Fortran) to someone not setting the &#39;status&#39; variable to an appropriate array size.<br>

<br>
</div>If you didn&#39;t compile your application with -i8, this could well be because your application is treating INTEGERs as 4 bytes, but OMPI is treating INTEGERs as 8 bytes.  Nothing good can come from that.<br>
<br>
If you *did* compile your application with -i8 and you&#39;re seeing this kind of wonkyness, we should dig deeper and see what&#39;s going on.<br>
<div class="im"><br>
&gt; My review of mpif.h and mpi.h seem to indicate that the functions are defined as C int types and therefore , I assume, the coercion during the compile makes the library support 64-bit indexing.  ie. int -&gt; long int<br>

<br>
</div>FWIW: We actually define a type MPI_Fint; its actual type is determined by configure (int or long int, IIRC).  When your Fortran code calls C, we use the MPI_Fint type for parameters, and so it will be either a 4 or 8 byte integer type.<br>
