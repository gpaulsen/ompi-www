Hi all,<br><br> I am trying to spawn dynamically processes in remote as well as local machine using MPI::Intracomm::Spawn_multiple. I am using MPI::Info object to tell where to launch processes using &quot;host&quot; key and &quot;&lt;ip_address&gt;&quot; as its value but but I am getting the error  <br>
<br clear="all">--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>There are no allocated resources for the application <br>  slaveprocess<br>that match the requested mapping:<br>  <br><br>Verify that you have mapped the allocated resources properly using the <br>
--host or --hostfile specification.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I tried with &quot;&lt;hostname&gt;&quot; too.<br>but its not working.<br><br>It works fine if I give the value &quot;localhost&quot; to &quot;host:&quot; key. It launches successfully processes in local machine.<br>
<br>any help will be greatly appreciated.<br><br>Regards,<br>-- <br>Vipin K.<br>Research Engineer,<br>C-Dot, Bangalore, India<br>
