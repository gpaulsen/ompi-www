<div dir="ltr"><br clear="all">Hi,<br><br><br>I&#39;ve been trying to install openmpi 1.2.5 on my cluster system running RHEL 4 (x64) with OFED 1.3. I need openmpi 1.2.5 (32 bit) and OFED seems to only install 64 bit version. I tried to build OFED with 32 bit support but it failed so I figure it&#39;s best to just compile 32 bit openmpi. I followed the FAQ and few user experience on the web.<br>
<br>I ran this command:<br>./configure --prefix=/usr/mpi/gcc/32bit --with-openib=/usr CFLAGS=-m32 CXXFLAGS=-m32 FFLAGS=-m32 FCFLAGS=-m32<br><br>and after few scrolling lines, it stops here:<br>--- MCA component btl:openib (m4 configuration macro)<br>
