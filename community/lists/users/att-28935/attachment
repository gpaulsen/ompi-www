    this is generally a bad idea :<br>
    many users are logged into the login node, some of them run a
    graphic desktop in VNC, they sometime<br>
    start (heavy) compilation and once in a while, they even run a
    (hopefully) small MPI application so they do not have to use the
    batch manager (e.g. write a script and wait for the resources)<br>
    head node can also run several monitoring daemons (not to mention a
    NFS server) and this node can be quite "noisy" (OS jitter). once in
    a while, some end users will just ask too much memory and the oom
    killer will be invoked (and it sometimes kill process you do hope it
    spared)<br>
    <br>
    bottom line, it is virtually impossible to predict how much RAM and
    CPU will be available when a job runs.<br>
    <br>
    most MPI applications are synchronous, which means the performance
    is driven by the slowest node.<br>
    The head node might or might not be the slowest node, this is quite
    unpredictable and end users will likely end up complaining about
    random performances of their application.<br>
    <br>
    if your budget allows it, i strongly recommend you do not run jobs
    on a head node.<br>
    <br>
    that being said, you might consider running an "overflow" queue but
    only for single node jobs on the head node<br>
    <br>
    Cheers,<br>
