<div dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:13px">Hi,</span><div style="font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:13px"><br></div><div style="font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:13px">I was comparing a simple Send-Recv  program to another program with two memcpy&#39;s to/from shared memory. Number of processes  = 2 and different array sizes (from 10^6 - 10^8 doubles) on IA64. With the --mca btl sm,self options I get almost twice the bandwidth compared to the two memcpy&#39;s. I looked at openmpi source and I cannot figure out if it&#39;s using anything other than simple glibc memcpy. I must be missing something. Can somebody please help?</div>
