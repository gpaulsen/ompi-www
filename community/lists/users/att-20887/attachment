    So far, I count three people interested in OpenMPI on Windows.&nbsp;
    That's not a case for ongoing support.<br>

      Since I did not see any Microsoft/other 'official' folks pick up
      the ball, let me step up. I have been lurking in this list for
      quite a while and I am a generic scientific programmer (i.e. I use
      many frameworks such as OpenCL/OpenMP etc, not just MPI)<br>
      Although I am primarily a Linux user, I do own multiple versions
      of Visual Studio licenses and have a small cluster that dual boots
      to Windows/Linux (and more nodes can be added on demand). I cannot
      do any large scale testing on this, but I can build and run
      regression tests etc.<br>
      <br>
      If the community needs the Windows support to continue, I can take
      up that responsibility, until a more capable person/group is found
      at least.<br>
      <br>
      Thanks<br>

          I completely missed the message about Shiqing departing as the
          OpenMPI Windows maintainer. &nbsp;I'll try and keep Windows builds
          going for 1.6 at least, I have 2011 and 2013 Intel licenses
          and VS2008 and 2012, but not 2010. &nbsp;I see that the 1.6.3 code
          base already doesn't build on Windows in VS2012 &nbsp;:-(.<br>
          <br>
          While I can try and keep builds going, I don't have access to
          a Windows cluster right now, and I'm flat out on two other
          projects. I can test on my workstation, but that will only go
          so far. Longer-term, there needs to be a decision made on
          whether Windows gets to be a first-class citizen in OpenMPI or
          not. &nbsp;Jeff's already told me that 1.7 is lagging behind on
          Windows. &nbsp;It would be a shame to have all the work Shiqing put
          in gradually decay because it can't be supported enough. &nbsp;If
          there's any Microsoft/HPC/Azure folks observing this list, or
          any other vendors who run on Windows with OpenMPI, maybe we
          can see what can be done if you're interested.<span
