<div dir="ltr">I have been struggling trying to get a usable build of openmpi on Mac 
OSX Mavericks (10.9.1).  I can get openmpi to configure and build 
without error, but have problems after that which depend on the openmpi 
version.  <br>
<div><div><div><div><div>

<br>With 1.6.5, make check fails the opal_datatype_test, ddt_test, and 
ddt_raw tests.  The various atomic_* tests pass.    See checklogs_1.6.5,
 attached as a .gz file.<br><br></div>Following suggestions from openmpi
 discussions I tried openmpi version 1.7.4rc1.  In this case make check 
indicates all tests passed.  But when I proceeded to try to build a 
parallel code (parallel HDF5) it failed.  Following an email exchange 
with the HDF5 support people, they suggested I try to compile and run 
the attached bit of simple code Sample_mpio.c (which they supplied) 
which does not use any HDF5, but just attempts a parallel write to a 
file and parallel read.   That test failed when requesting more than 1 
processor -- which they say indicates a failure of the openmpi 
installation.   The error message was:<br>

<br>MPI_INIT: argc 1<br>MPI_INIT: argc 1<br>Testing simple C MPIO program with 2 processes accessing file ./mpitest.data<br>    (Filename can be specified via program argument)<br>Proc 0: hostname=Ron-Cohen-MBP.local<br>


Proc 1: hostname=Ron-Cohen-MBP.local<br>
MPI_BARRIER[0]: comm MPI_COMM_WORLD<br>MPI_BARRIER[1]: comm MPI_COMM_WORLD<br>Proc 0: MPI_File_open with MPI_MODE_EXCL failed (MPI_ERR_FILE: invalid file)<br>MPI_ABORT[0]: comm MPI_COMM_WORLD errorcode 1<br>MPI_BCAST[1]: buffer 7fff5a483048 count 1 datatype MPI_INT root 0 comm MPI_COMM_WORLD<br>



<br>
I then went back to my openmpi directories and tried running some of the
 individual tests in the test and examples directories.  In particular 
in test/class I found one test that seem to not be run as part of make 
check which failed, even with one processor; this is opal_bitmap.  Not 
sure if this is because 1.7.4rc1 is incomplete, or there is something 
wrong with the installation, or maybe a 32 vs 64 bit thing?   The error 
message is <br>


<br>mpirun detected that one or more processes exited with non-zero status, thus causing the job to be terminated. The first process to do so was:<br><br>  Process name: [[48805,1],0]<br>  Exit code:    255<br><br></div>




Any suggestions?<br><br></div>More generally has anyone out there gotten
 an openmpi build on Mavericks to work with sufficient success that they
 can get the attached Sample_mpio.c (or better yet, parallel HDF5) to 
build?  <br>


<br></div>Details: Running Mac OS X 10.9.1 on a mid-2009 Macbook pro 
with 4 GB memory; tried openmpi 1.6.5 and 1.7.4rc1.  Built openmpi 
against the stock gcc that comes with XCode 5.0.2, and gfortran 4.9.0.  <br><br></div>

<div>Files attached: config.log.gz, openmpialllog.gz (output of running 
ompi_info --all), checklog2.gz (output of make.check in top openmpi 
directory).  <br><br></div>I am not attaching logs of make and 
install since those seem to have been successful, but can generate those
 if that would be helpful.</div>
