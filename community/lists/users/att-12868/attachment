Hello,<div><br></div><div>In my Fortran 90 code I use several custom defined derived types. Amongst them is a vector of arrays, i.e. v(:)%f(:,:,:). I am wondering what the proper way of sending this data structure from one processor to another is. Is the best way to just restructure the data by copying it into a vector and sending that or is there a simpler way possible by defining an MPI derived type that can handle it?</div>

<div><br></div><div>I looked into the latter myself but so far, I have only found the solution for a scalar fortran derived type and the methodology that was suggested in that case did not seem naturally extensible to the vector case.</div>

<div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Thanks any help you can give me!</div><div><br></div><div><div><div>-- <br>Vedran Coralic<br>
