<div dir="ltr">Dear all,<div><br></div><div>I am trying to implement some features using a one-sided communication scheme.</div><div><br></div><div>The problem is that I understand the different one-sided communication schemes as this (basic words):</div><div>MPI_Get) </div><div>fetches remote window memory to a local memory space</div><div>MPI_Get_Accumulate) </div><div>1. fetches remote window memory to a local memory space</div><div>2. sends a local memory space (different from that used in 1.) to the remote window and does OP on those two quantities</div><div>MPI_Put)</div><div>sends local memory space to remote window memory</div><div>MPI_Accumulate)</div><div>sends a local memory space to the remote window and does OP on those two quantities<br></div><div>(surprisingly the documentation says that this only works with windows within the same node, note that MPI_Get_Accumulate does not say this constraint)</div><div><br></div><div>?)</div><div>Where is the function that fetches remotely and does operation in a local memory space?</div><div><br></div><div>Do I really have to do MPI_Get to local memory, then do operation manually? (no it is not difficult, but... ;) )</div><div>I would like this to exist: MPI_Get_Reduce(origin,...,target,...,MPI_OP,...) </div><div><br></div><div>When I just looked at the API names I thought Get_Accumulate did this, but to my surprise that was not the case at all. :)<br></div><div><br></div><div>-- <br><div class="gmail_signature"><div dir="ltr"><div>Kind regards Nick</div></div></div>
