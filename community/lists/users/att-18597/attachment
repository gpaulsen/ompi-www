Hi,<br><br>I&#39;m a newbie with openMPI so the problem it&#39;s probably me :)<br>Im using a Fortran 90 code developed under Ubuntu 10.04. I&#39;ve recently installed the same code on my Archlinux machine but I have some issues concerning openMPI. <br>

A simple example-code works fine on both machine while the &quot;big&quot; code gives a segmentation fault error on Archlinux. <br>On Ubuntu gcc 4.3 is used while on Arch gcc version is 4.6. Is there a way to make openmpi use gcc 4.3? <br>

<br>thanks<br>
