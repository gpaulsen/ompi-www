<p class="">Hello!</p>
<p class="">We are having problems integrating BLCR + OpenMPI + LSF in a linux cluster with Infiniband<br></p>
<p class="">We compiled OpenMPI version 1.6 with gcc version 4.6.0 ... The configure line was like:<br></p>
<p class="">./configure --prefix=/opt/share/mpi-openmpi/1.6-gcc-4.6.0/el6/x86_64 --with-lsf --with-openib --with-blcr=/opt/share/blcrv0.8.4.app/ --with-ft=cr --enable-ft-thread --enable-opal-multi-threads --with-psm<br></p>


<p class="">The problem I am having is that for some reason the ft-enable-cr features freezes my mpi application when I use more that one node. The job is never started ...<br></p>
<p class="">We narrowed the search down and we noticed that when mpirun is used out of the batch system, it works... but as soon as the mpirun detects the env variable LSB_JOBID and assumes it is under LSF environment, the problem arises... Additionally, if we use &quot;--mca plm rsh&quot; which should deactivate the LSF integration , it works again, as expected...</p>


<p class="">So, or guess is: or there is something misconfigured in our LSF or there is a problem in the plm module inside openmpi ...<br></p>
<p class="">Any hint???<br></p>
<p class="">Thanks!!<br></p><p class="">Jorge Naranjo<br></p></div>
