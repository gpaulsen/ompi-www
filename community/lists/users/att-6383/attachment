<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" ><tr><td valign="top" style="font: inherit;">Thanks George, I will update and try the latest repo. However I'd like to describe our usage case a bit more to see if there is something that may not be proper in our development approach. Forgive me if this is repetitious...<br><br>We have configured and built OpenMPI originally on a machine with Infinipath / PSM installed. Since we desire a flexible software development environment across a number of machines (most of them are without the Infinipath hw), we run these same OpenMPI bins in a shared user area. That means other developer's machines, which do not have Infinipath / PSM installed locally, will simulate the multiple machine communication by running in shared memory mode.&nbsp; But again these OpenMPI bins have been configured with Infinipath support.<br><br>So we see the error when running in shared memory mode on machines that don't have
 Infinipath, so is there a way at runtime that you can force shared memory mode exclusively? We are wondering if designating MPI_ANY_SOURCE may then direct OpenMPI to look at every possible communications mode and that probably would cause conflicts if there wasn't psm libs present.<br><br>Hope this makes sense, Tom<br><br><br><br>Things were working without issue until we went to the wildcard MPI_ANY_SOURCE on our receives but only on machines without . I guess I wonder what is the mechanism when in a wildcard mode. <br><br>--- On <b>Sun, 8/17/08, George Bosilca <i>&lt;bosilca@eecs.utk.edu&gt;</i></b> wrote:<br><blockquote style="border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255); margin-left: 5px; padding-left: 5px;">From: George Bosilca &lt;bosilca@eecs.utk.edu&gt;<br>Subject: Re: [OMPI users] MPI_ERR_TRUNCATE with MPI_Revc without Infinipath<br>To: rarebitusa@yahoo.com, "Open MPI Users" &lt;users@open-mpi.org&gt;<br>Date: Sunday, August 17, 2008, 2:42

One that  <br>&gt; has Infinipath HCAs  installed and another that doesn't. I run both  <br>&gt; of these in shared memory mode ie: dual processes on the same node.  <br>&gt; I have verified that when I am on the host with Infinipath I am  <br>&gt; actually running the OpenMPI mpirun, not
 the mpi that comes with the  <br>&gt; HCA.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I have built OpenMPI with psm support from a fairly recent svn pull  <br>&gt; and run the same bins on both host machines... The config was as  <br>&gt; follows:<br>&gt; &gt; $ ../configure --prefix=/opt/wkspace/openmpi-1.3 CC=gcc CXX=g++<br>&gt; &gt; --disable-mpi-f77 --enable-debug --enable-memchecker<br>&gt; &gt; --with-psm=/usr/include --with-valgrind=/opt/wkspace/valgrind-3.3.0/<br>&gt; &gt; mpirun --version<br>&gt; mpirun (Open MPI) 1.4a1r18908<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The error presents itself only on the host that does not have  <br>&gt; Infinipath installed. I have combed through the mca args to see if  <br>&gt; there is a setting I am missing but I cannot see anything obvious.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Any input would be appreciated. Thanks.
