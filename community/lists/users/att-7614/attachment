<p><a name="heterogeneous-support">Dear OpenMPI Users,</a></p><p><a name="heterogeneous-support">I have two systems, one with Intel64 processor, and one with IA32. The OSs on first is CentOS-86_64 and the other CentOS-i386. I installed Intel fortran compiler 10.1 on both.&nbsp; In the first I use the fce, and in the second I use fc directories (ifortvars.sh/csh). I have compiled openmpi separately on each machine. Now, I could not run my application whch is compiled on ia32 machine. Should I use &quot;fc&quot; instead of &quot;fce&quot; on intel64 and then compile openmpi with that?</a></p>
<p><a name="heterogeneous-support">Best regards,</a></p><p><a name="heterogeneous-support">Mahmoud Payami</a></p><p><a name="heterogeneous-support">PS: I have read the following FAQ but I need specific answer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
</a></p><p><a name="heterogeneous-support">As of v1.1, Open MPI requires that the size of C, C++, and
Fortran datatypes be the same on all platforms within a single
parallel application with the exception of types represented by
<code>MPI_BOOL</code> and <code>MPI_LOGICAL</code> -- size differences in these types
between processes are properly handled.  Endian differences between
processes in a single MPI job are properly and automatically handled.

</a></p><p><a name="heterogeneous-support">Prior to v1.1, Open MPI did not include any support for data size or
endian heterogeneity.</a></p>
