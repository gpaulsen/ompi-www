<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" ><tr><td valign="top" style="font: inherit;">Thanks for your suggestion !<br>"$ mpirun --host localhost,name_of_distant_machine hostname" works.<br>In fact, the simple programs that prints " I am process # " always works. Problem arises only if there is communication between process which are lying on two different computers.<br><br>I don't think it is a problem of ssh/rsh because it works well if i put only name_of_distant_machine in the&nbsp; --host. Maybe because of the two computers are virtuals and the network by default for mpirun is eth0 and not eth1 ?<br><br>Son.<br><br><br>--- En date de&nbsp;: <b>Mar 27.4.10, Jeff Squyres <i>&lt;jsquyres@cisco.com&gt;</i></b> a écrit&nbsp;:<br><blockquote style="border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255); margin-left: 5px; padding-left: 5px;"><br>De: Jeff Squyres &lt;jsquyres@cisco.com&gt;<br>Objet: Re: [OMPI users] mpirun works locally but not through
