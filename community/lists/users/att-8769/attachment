<br></div><div>My cluster consists of two nodes, master(running on fedora 10) and compute(CentOS 5.2) node, connected directly through a cross cable.</div><div><br></div><div>I installed openmpi on both, there were many folders n files on de master node but there were none on de compute node. i again ran yum install openmpi successfully on de compute node but still there were no openmpi folders or files installed.</div>
