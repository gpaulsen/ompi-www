      <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">We need to build an
        application on our machine with one mpi (e.g. openmpi),<br>
        but for performance reasons, upon installation, we would like to
        runtime<br>
        link to a different, specialized mpi, such as an SGI
        implementation provided<br>
        for their systems.<br>
        <br>
        Can one expect this to work?<br>
        <br>
        I tried this with openmpi and mpich, building the code against
        shared openmpi<br>
        and then changing the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the shared
        mpich.&nbsp; This<br>
        failed due to the sonames being different.<br>
        <br>
        $ ldd foo&nbsp; | grep mpi<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; libmpi_usempi.so.1 =&gt; not found<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; libmpi_mpifh.so.2 =&gt; not found<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; libmpi.so.1 =&gt; not found<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; libmpi_cxx.so.1 =&gt; not found<br>
        <br>
        but in the mpich distribution one has different sonames<br>
        <br>
        libmpi.so.12<br>
        <br>
        so the runtime loader will not load the mpich libraries instead.<br>
        <br>
        and the fortran libraries (which may not matter to us) have
        different<br>
        names,<br>
        <br>
        $ \ls /contrib/mpich-shared/lib/*.so.12<br>
        /contrib/mpich-shared/lib/libmpicxx.so.12<br>
        /contrib/mpich-shared/lib/libmpifort.so.12<br>
        /contrib/mpich-shared/lib/libmpi.so.12<br>
        <br>
        Is there a general approach to this?<br>
        <br>
        Or in practice, must one build on a machine to use that
        machine's MPI?<br>
        <br>
