<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for the reply,</div>
<div>A few Additional questions,</div>
<div>1.&nbsp;Does OpenMPI has the optimisations required to ensure that when send/recv is called between 2&nbsp;ranks on the same node, the shared memory kind of methods&nbsp;should be used?</div>
<div>2.&nbsp; If a programmer wants to implement such a logic(optimisations for local send/recv) , what part of the code should he modify from the openMPI stack ?<br>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; regards,</div>
<div>-Chev<br><br>&nbsp;</div>
