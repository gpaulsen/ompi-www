<BR>
I have seen this reported twice now &#8211; I think from two different sources, but I could be incorrect. Unfortunately, we don&#8217;t have access to an AIX cluster to investigate the problem. We don&#8217;t see it on any other platform at this time.<BR>
<BR>
Could you tell me something more about your cluster? In particular, it would help to know your launch environment (e.g., rsh/ssh, SLURM, TM, etc.). The noted behavior of using &#8212;debug-daemons to resolve the problem has me puzzled as that flag only causes the daemons to keep their stdio ports open &#8211; it has nothing to do with the application processes nor the I/O forwarding subsystem.<BR>
<BR>
I can suggest a couple of options in the interim, though I don&#8217;t know that they will solve the problem:<BR>
<BR>

</SPAN></FONT><LI><FONT FACE="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><SPAN STYLE='font-size:12.0px'>You could try configuring Open MPI with &#8220;--disable-pty-support&#8221;. The I/O forwarding system is currently based upon pty&#8217;s. We have seen a problem on one other platform where the pty support wasn&#8217;t quite what Open MPI expects &#8211; disabling it solved the problem. You should first check if the 1.1.2 release supports this configuration option (I honestly can&#8217;t remember &#8211; it has been too long) - you may need to upgrade to 1.2 to do this.<BR>
</SPAN></FONT></OL><FONT FACE="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><SPAN STYLE='font-size:12.0px'><BR>
I hope that provides some help. If/when we get access to an AIX cluster, we&#8217;ll try to dig deeper into this issue.<BR>

Hello, <BR>
<BR>
We have Open MPI 1.1.2 installed on IBM AIX 5.3 cluster. It looks like <BR>
terminal output is broken. There are a few entry in the archive for this problem, <BR>
with no suggested solution or real work around. <BR>
<BR>
I am putting this posting with hope to get some advise for a work around or solution. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
#mpirun -np 1 &nbsp;hostname &nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No out put, piping the command to &quot;cat&quot; or &quot;more&quot; generate no out put as well. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way to get an output from this command is to add --debug-daemons <BR>
<BR>
#mpirun -np 1 --debug-daemons &nbsp;hostname <BR>
<BR>
Even this debug option is not working for a real application which generate several output. <BR>
<BR>
Looking forward for any comments. <BR>
<BR>
Thanks <BR>
<BR>
Ali, <BR>
