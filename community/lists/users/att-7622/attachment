Dear OpenMPI Users,<br>
<br>
I have two systems, one with Intel64 processor, and one with IA32. The OSs on first is CentOS-86_64 and the other CentOS-i386. I installed Intel fortran compiler 10.1 on both. &nbsp;In the first I use the fce, and in the second I use fc directories (ifortvars.sh/csh). I have compiled openmpi separately on each machine. Now, I could not run my application whch is compiled on ia32 machine. Should I use &quot;fc&quot; instead of &quot;fce&quot; on intel64 and then compile openmpi with that?<br>

Could you give us some more information? What is the error message?<br>
You said that the application is compiled for the 32 bit architecture. I&#39;m not used to mixing 32/64 bit architectures. Does the application run on each host seperately?<br>

</blockquote></div><br>Dear Dorian,<br>Thank you&nbsp; for your contribution. The application, compiled on each box separately, is ok with mpi an no problem. Recently, I had checked that a binary file created on ia32, also works on 86_64 but the reverse is not true. So, why not a parallel program which is compiled on ia32 box? I think, if I configure and install openmpi using ia32 intel compiler on 86_64 box, then it will be resolved.<br>
I have to check it and will report the result. In present case, it is searching for shared lib.so.0 which has some extension &quot;..ELF...64&quot;. I have already added &quot;/usr/local/lib&quot; which contains mpi libs in LD_LIBRARY_PATH otherwise they would not work on each box even separatey.<br>
Bests, Happy 2009<br>mahmoud<br>&nbsp;<br>
