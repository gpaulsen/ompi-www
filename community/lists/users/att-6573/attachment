<div dir="ltr">Thank you very much. That was it. I didn&#39;t know that by default it was any firewall running on the default Yellow Dog Linux installations since nothing was asked about this issue during the installation.<div>

Looks like a firewall problem. Please check the mailing list archives for the proper fix.<br>

Hi,<br>
<br>
I am new to MPI and try to get my Open MPI environment up and running. I have two machines Alpha and Beta, on which I have successfully installed Open MPI in /usr/local/openmpi. I have made the ssh setting to not have to enter password manually (using rsa keys), and I have modified the .rc files to get the right path and right LD_LIBRARY_PATH when login using ssh on both machines.<br>

<br>
In order to check if my installation was working I have started &quot;mpirun hostname&quot; on Alpha and it is working just fine.<br>
I have tested as well &quot;mpirun hostname&quot; on Beta and it is working fine too.<br>
<br>
I have tested &quot;ssh beta env&quot; to check that my setting are correct and it is working as expected.<br>
<br>
BUT when I am running &quot;mpirun -host beta hostname&quot; from Alpha nothing happens. After several minutes I have to kill the &quot;mpirun&quot; process with Ctrl-C (two times). Does any of you run into similar problem and could tell me what I am doing wrong ? It seems that each local installation are working fine but I can not start tasks on other nodes.<br>

<br>
The interesting point is that when I run a &quot;ps&quot; on Beta I can see that a &quot;orted&quot; process is started (and stay in process list) for each of my try to run &quot;mpirun&quot; command from Alpha. So somehow Beta gets the command to start orted and does it but then, nothing happens .......<br>

<br>
I have been browsing the users list for similar issues and I found one guy describing exactly the same problem but it was no answer to his post.<br>
<br>
Not sure if this is relevant but Alpha and Beta are Sony PS3 machines running Yellow Dog Linux 6.1<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance for your help.<br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
Chris<br></div></div>
