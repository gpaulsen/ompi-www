To realize this I use the Issend and the Iprobe and Ireceive Operation.<br>When using the Issend and the Ireceive operation I use the MPI_CHAR datatype because I try to send/receive a serialized object as a std::string. This works for most operations. But when I send a larger string it seems to be that only a part of it is received at the other process. The Iprobe operation set the size of the message correctly. But the receiving string ist not as large as the sending one.<br>Is there any size-limits at the buffers? Is it possible to change the buffer-size?<br><br>I am thankful for all your informations<br>Greetings Franz Xaver<br></td></tr></table><br>
