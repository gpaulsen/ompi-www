Without including the -x DISPLAY, glut doesn&#39;t know what display to open.  For instance, without the -x DISPLAY parameter glut returns an error from each process stating that it could not find display &quot;&quot; (empty string).  This strategy is briefly described in the openmpi  <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=running#mpirun-gui"> FAQs</a> for launching gui applications with openmpi. <br>
<div><br><div>I&#39;m assuming that by setting the DISPLAY envar to :0.0, each process will render to their local display, which is my intention, and as I previously stated works for up to 2 processes. So I believe it to be necessary.  </div>
<div><br></div><div>But I&#39;m thinking I may have to configure some kind of  X11 forwarding.  I&#39;m not sure...</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks for your reply! Any more ideas?</div><div>Brad</div><div><br></div><div><br>

Guess I&#39;m not entirely sure I understand how this is supposed to work. All the -x does is tell us to pickup an envar of the given name and forward its value to the remote apps. You can&#39;t set the envar&#39;s value on the cmd line. So you told mpirun to pickup the value of an envar called &quot;DISPLAY=:0.0&quot;.<br>

<br>
So yes - I would expect this would be behaving strangely.<br>
<br>
If you tell us -x DISPLAY, we&#39;ll pickup the local value of DISPLAY and forward it. What that will cause your app to do is, I suppose, up to it.<br>

&gt; Hello,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I&#39;m working on an mpi application that opens a glut display on each node of a small cluster for opengl rendering (each node has its own display). My current implementation scales great with mpich2, but I&#39;d like to use openmpi infiniband, which is giving me trouble.<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; I&#39;ve had some success with the -x DISPLAY=:0.0 parameter to mpirun, which will open the display on up to 2 of my nodes... any 2.  But when I attempt to run the application on 4 nodes, the display is non-deterministic. If any open at all process 0 definately will, and sometimes process 3 along with that.  I haven&#39;t observed much behavior from process 1 or 2.<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; My command:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; mpirun -x DISPLAY=:0.0 -np 4 -hostfile ~/openmpi.hosts ./myapp<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I&#39;ve tried adding the -d option with no success.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Does anyone have any suggestions or comments?  I&#39;ll certainly provide more information if required.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Thanks,<br>
&gt; Brad<br>
