I&#39;m afraid I have no idea - I&#39;ve never seen a Torque version that old, however, so it is quite possible that we don&#39;t work with it. It also looks like it may have been modified (given the p2-aspen3 on the end), so I have no idea how the system would behave.<br>
<br>First thing you could do is verify that the allocation is being read correctly. Add a --display-allocation to the cmd line and see what we think Torque gave us. Then add --display-map to see where it plans to place the processes.<br>
<br>If all that looks okay, and if you allow ssh, then try -mca plm rsh on the cmd line and see if that works.<br><br>HTH<br>Ralph<br><br><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Tue, Jul 21, 2009 at 12:57 PM, Song, Kai Song <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:KSong@lbl.gov">KSong@lbl.gov</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br>

<br>
I am building open-mpi-1.3.2 on centos-3.4, with torque-1.1.0p2-aspen3 and myrinet. I compiled it just fine with this configuration:<br>
./configure --prefix=/home/software/ompi/1.3.2-pgi --with-gm=/usr/local/ --with-gm-libdir=/usr/local/lib64/ --enable-static --disable-shared --with-tm=/usr/ --without-threads CC=pgcc CXX=pgCC FC=pgf90 F77=pgf77 LDFLAGS=-L/usr/lib64/torque/<br>

<br>
However, when I submit jobs for 2 or more nodes through the torque schedular, the jobs just hang here. It shows the RUN state, but no communication between the nodes, then jobs will die with timeout.<br>
<br>
We have comfirmed that the myrinet is working because our lam-mpi-7.1 works just fine. We are having a really hard time determining what are the causes for this problem. So, we suspect it&#39;s because our torque is too old.<br>

<br>
What is the lowest version requirement of torque for open-mpi-1.3.2? The README file didn&#39;t specify this detail. Does anyone know more about it?<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance,<br>
<br>
