Hi every one!<div><br></div><div>After reading the FAQ about OFED, I knew that openMPI can collaborate with RoCE. Moreover, using the RoCE make some overhead because the underlying network layers. In my infiniband bandwidth testing, I get the 5Gbps using IPoIB and 12Gbps using RDMA. The performance gap is huge for my application.<br>
<br></div><div>My question is: Could the OpenMPI use the RDMA raw api not via network layer?!<br><br>Best regards<br>Joen Chen</div>
