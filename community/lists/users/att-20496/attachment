Hi, <br>    My question is &quot; In MPI community , Is there a program like this ? &quot;<br>       Describe about this program: I have the cluster to run MPI Program. But before running, I want to check the connection and to measure some performance features of this system like latency, bandwidth ... It means i created the number of processes is equal to the number of nodes. And it actually each process will run in each individual node. And then, i use blocking, non-blocking , synchronous... communication to communicate among processes. And then, I can measure the latency, bandwidth... from one node to another node. It like test the system before running MPI Program<br>
    Is anyone know about this program with the same function ? Thanks and hope to see your reply soon . <br><br>
