    This is a benchmarking project for the next couple of months because
    we're building our GPU system at the moment. Right now I'm using HPL
    2.0 from the site <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://netlib.org/benchmark/hpl">http://netlib.org/benchmark/hpl</a> on our CPU only
    cluster. I have the CUDA version from Nvidia downloaded for when our
    system is running though. I just need to have a pretty good idea of
    how to run the benchmark with GPUs because we would like to get into
    the Top 500. But the main purpose of the system is for running
    research jobs, so we can't spend too much time trying to figure out
    how to run HPL. I just thought that the GPUs needed to be specified
    through the hostfile of mpirun, but I guess I'm wrong. Since this
    isn't really an openmpi question, do you know of any knowledge bases
    about HPL on GPUs? <br>

So this is an inquiry related to hpl, not Open MPI. Anyways, which
version of HPL are you using and how would you specify the GPU to use
sans MPI?

Best
