Hi,<br><br>I am developing a runtime detector for noncrashing <br>bugs in MPI applications. It is capable of collecting<br>MPI communication and diagnose if a node is abnormal <br>based on its communication with other nodes.<br><br>Therefore, it is highly desirable to have a couple of <br>noncrashing bugs from real-life MPI application <br> that would manifest themselves in abnormal <br>communication to test my tool. Or if someone <br>experienced in development with MPI could give <br>advice on the frequency of such bugs happening <br>in the past?<br><br>Thank you,<br><br>Bowen<br> 		 	   		  <br /><hr />Hotmail: Free, trusted and rich email service. <a href='https://signup.live.com/signup.aspx?id=60969' target='_new'>Get it now.</a></body>
