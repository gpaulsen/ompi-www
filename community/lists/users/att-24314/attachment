Looks like I fixed that late last year.  A slew of &quot;&gt;31 bit transfers&quot; fixes went into the MPICH-3.1 release.  Slurping those changes, which are individually small (using some _x versions of type-inquiry routines here, some MPI_Count promotions there) but pervasive, might give OpenMPI a bit of a headache.<br>

I&#39;m glad these fixes to ROMIO have been done, hopefully they won&#39;t be too much of a headache, and they&#39;ll become a bit more widespread. In the meantime I&#39;ll investigate using MPICH 3.1 with ROMIO vs. OpenMPI with OMPIO.</div>
