</span><br>
<span class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; the nodes have no clue how to reach 137.248.0.0 -
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; they have no gateway to this network at all.

</span><br>
<span class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; I have to revert this.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; They think that there is a gateway although it isn't.

<span class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; When I remove the entry by hand for the gateway in the

<span class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; The gateway on this cluster is indeed going

<span class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Personally I find this behavior a little bit too aggressive

<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Hi Reuti
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You could use the mca parameter file
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (say, $prefix/etc/openmpi-mca-params.conf) to configure cluster-wide
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the oob (and btl) interfaces to be used.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The users can still override your choices if they want.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Just put a line like this in openmpi-mca-params.conf :
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; oob_tcp_if_include=192.168.154.0/26
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (and similar for btl_tcp_if_include, btl_openib_if_include).
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Get a full list from &quot;ompi_info --all --all |grep if_include&quot;.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</span><br>

</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Compute nodes tend to be multi-homed, so what criterion would OMPI use
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to select one interface among many,
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; My compute nodes are having two interfaces:
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; one for MPI (and the low ssh/SGE traffic to start processes somewhere)
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; and one for NFS to transfer files from/to the file server.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; So: Open MPI may use both interfaces without telling me anything about it?
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; How will it split the traffic? 50%/50%?
</span><br>
<p>Honestly, I don't know.
<br>
My suggestion is to pick the interface you really want via mca parameters.
<br>
Not sure if there is a way to make OMPI report what it is doing in this 
<br>
regard when many interfaces are available.
<br>
<p>Ralph, Jeff, OMPI experts:
<br>
<p>If we write -mca btl_tcp_if_include eth0,eth1
<br>
will the interface order (eth0,eth1 as opposed to eth1,eth0) have any 
<br>
impact on how they are used by OMPI.
<br>
If we don't write anything, will OMPI somehow select and use the fastest?
<br>
Will it drop the slowest or the slower ones?
<br>
How will it split the traffic?
<br>
<p><p><span class="quotelev1">&gt; When there is a heavy file transfer on the NFS interface:
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; might it hurt Open MPI's communication or will it balance the usage on-the-fly?
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<p>I prefer to separate the two traffic lanes.
<br>
NFS has been by far a much more frequent source
<br>
of trouble than (Open)MPI.
<br>
Hence, I setup the mca parameter file to use the IB interface (&quot;openib&quot; 
<br>
and &quot;sm&quot; - which is now &quot;vader&quot; after 1.8.X- and &quot;self&quot;) for btl (I 
<br>
didn't bother to set it for oob), and mount NFS on Ethernet
<br>
I tried NFS4 over rdma and over IPoIB and the results weren't so good.
<br>
I didn't have much time to test/experiment (NFSv3 etc), so moved to 
<br>
production that way.
<br>
<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt; When I prepare a machinefile with the name of the interfaces
</span><br>
(or get the names from SGE's PE_HOSTFILE) it should use just this 
<br>
(except native IB),
<br>
and not looking around for other paths to the other machine(s) (IMO).
<br>
<p>Normally I don't handcraft the machine file, just use what the resource
<br>
manager gives (Torque in my case).
<br>
Some programs (say MPMD) require handcrafting (or using the mpiexec
<br>
<p>Based on your other emails to Ralph, I believe we are talking about two 
<br>
end members in the way the interfaces are picked:
<br>
<p>1) The current OMPI approach: In principle use everything, and let you 
<br>
(and/or the user) re-configure it with mca parameters (in gazillions of
<br>
different ways, very flexible) to fit your computer configuration and
<br>
needs.
<br>
<p>I do like this, because I guess it would be very difficult for OMPI to 
<br>
make a specific interface choice (and get it right) not knowing
<br>
the details of your network setup, name resolution, etc.
<br>
[Just see the NFS vs. MPI networks that you, me, and others have.]
<br>
<p>Also, you can simply use the mca parameter configuration file to your
<br>
advantage, and to fine tune everything to your clusters.
<br>
Still, power users can override your settings if they need, bu using
<br>
their own .opempi mca configuration files, or environment variables,
<br>
or mpiexec mca command line options.
<br>
<p>2) What you seem to be proposing  which is to use whatever IP address 
<br>
that resolves to the host names in the hostfile (handcrafted, given by
<br>
the RM, or on the fly via --hosts option), or the IP themselves instead 
<br>
of names.
<br>
[I hope I understood you right and did not misrepresent what you said.]
<br>
<p>I confess I don't see this as an advantage.
<br>
It is unlikely that your hostnames resolve to the right interface that 
<br>
you want to use for MPI (and actually your and my IB interfaces do *not* 
<br>
resolve to the target IP/inteface, it is the Ethernet that does resolve 
<br>
this way, and you don't want to use Ethernet for MPI).
<br>
<p><p>Therefore different interfaces have different names in my setup.
<br>
&quot;node01&quot; is just eth0 and different from &quot;node01-nfs&quot; for eth1.
<br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not knowing beforehand what exists in a particular computer?
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; There would be a risk to make a bad choice.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The current approach gives you everything, and you
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; pick/select/restrict what you want to fit your needs,
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; with mca parameters (which can be set in several
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ways and with various scopes).
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I don't think this bad.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; However, I am biased about this.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I like and use the openmpi-mca-params.conf file
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to setup sensible defaults.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; At least I think they are sensible. :)
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; I see that this can be prepared for all users this way.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; Whenever they use my installed version it will work -
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; maybe I have to investigate on some other clusters where
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not root what to enter there, but it can be done for sure.
</span><br>
<p>If you need to support OMPI users in clusters where you don't
<br>
have root access,
<br>
you can either ask the sysadmin to insert the mca configuration file in
<br>
the $OMPI/etc directory, or you can give to each user a tailored 
<br>
.openmpi file to put in their home directory.
<br>
There are certainly other ways also.
<br>
See the FAQ:
<br>
<a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=tuning#setting-mca-params">http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=tuning#setting-mca-params</a>
<br>
<p>IMHO, this mca parameter flexibility is really one of the big upsides of
<br>
OMPI.
<br>
<p>The downside may be that there are just gazillions of parameters,
<br>
and not nearly enough clarity (and documentation) on what one should do
<br>
to do to choose good values.
<br>
(I am struggling with the sm/vader parameters, parameters for 
<br>
collectives, etc).
<br>
However, for the network setup I think that is not so hard,
<br>
more or less straightforward once you know the cluster network details.
<br>
Ralph and Jeff will kill me for complaining about documentation for the
<br>
gazillionth time ...
<br>
<p><p><span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; BUT: it may be a rare situation that a group for quantum chemistry
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; is having a sysadmin on their own taking care of the clusters and
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; the well behaving operation of the installed software, being it
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; applications or libraries. Often any PhD student in other groups
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; will get a side project: please install software XY for the group.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; They are chemists and want to get the software running -
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; they are no experts of Open MPI*.
</span><br>
<p>We have atmosphere/ocean/climate science folks here,
<br>
but that is where the differences stop.
<br>
They are certainly not MPI experts (and not much interested in those 
<br>
details).
<br>
So, that is why providing a set of sensible defaults is a good thing.
<br>
<p>Or perhaps, if needed, you can think of a set of defaults depending on 
<br>
the application (and distribute them via the MCA aggregate parameters 
<br>
(same FAQ):
<br>
<a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=tuning#setting-mca-params">http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=tuning#setting-mca-params</a>
<br>
<p><p><span class="quotelev1">&gt;They don't care for a tight integration or using the correct interfaces as
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; long as the application delivers the results in the end. For example: ORCA**.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; It's necessary for the users of the software to install a shared library of
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; Open MPI in a specific version. I see in the ORCA*** forum that many
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; struggle with it to compile a shared library version of Open MPI and
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; have access to it during execution, i.e. how to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; that it's known on the slaves. The cluster admins are in another
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; department and refuse to make any special arrangements for a
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; single group sometimes.
</span><br>
<p>Fortunately, I don't have these political boundaries in the clusters I 
<br>
oversee.
<br>
We provide as much as we can in terms of builds of OMPI and other 
<br>
libraries, and make them available through enviroment modules.
<br>
I guess this is pretty much what you and many others do,
<br>
along with Wikis or README files on how to do basic stuff,
<br>
or compile and run the most popular programs.
<br>
<p>However, in the university-wide cluster the situation is similar to what
<br>
you describe, and there is a lot of user disappointment with that.
<br>
I such situations, I've seen people installing OpenMPI in their home 
<br>
directory, etc.
<br>
You could try to do this for the users, but that is a bit of an insane 
<br>
job, too much work spread across many users.
<br>
However,
<br>
quite frankly I think that is this is cluster sysadmin duty, too bad if 
<br>
the &quot;other department&quot; fellows don't consider that a service too the users.
<br>
<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt; And as ORCA calls `mpiexec` several
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; times during one job, the delay could occur several times.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<p>If it is in a cluster that you don't have control of, give the users a
<br>
.openmpi/mca-params.conf file.
<br>
That may help.
<br>
<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt; On some other clusters that we have access to, the admins prepare
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; Open MPI installations accessible by `modules`. But often not for the
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; required combination of Open MPI and compiler type and version which is needed.
</span><br>
<p>I understand the problem, but if you cannot convince the sys admins to 
<br>
build OMPI and other libraries needed, the only way to solve the problem
<br>
is to teach users to install OMPI in their own home directories 
<br>
(assuming it is mounted cluster-wide).
<br>
Or do it for them.
<br>
<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt; If a software vendor suggests to use compiler X in version Y it's the best to
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; follow that approach as it will generate less issues which might need to be
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; investigated - i.e. numerical variations as different compilers optimize in a
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; different way. Hence you end up to compile the necessary Open MPI on your own
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; again and set again sensible defaults as you lay out above.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<p>We have to build many combinations with different compilers also.
<br>
Some programs only compile with Intel, others with PGI, a few are kind
<br>
enough to compile with gfortran, and it is not only OMPI, but other 
<br>
libraries as well (HDF5, NetCDF, etc).
<br>
One sticking point is that Fortran &gt;90 modules are not compatible across 
<br>
compilers.
