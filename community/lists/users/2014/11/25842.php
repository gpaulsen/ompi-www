<br>
<p>I've seen several suggestions for &quot;home-brew&quot; systems, usually modifying the paging mechanism.  However there is one commercial solution I have seen advertised: <a href="https://numascale.com/index.html">https://numascale.com/index.html</a>
<br>
<p>I've never used them and have no idea if they are any good or as good as they claim, you'll have to decide for yourself.
<br>

Subject: [OMPI users] job running out of memory
<br>
<p><p>Hi all:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am running openmpi 1.6.5 and a job which is memory intensive.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The job runs on 7 hosts using 16 core on each. On one of the hosts the memory is exhausted so the kernel starts to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Kill the processes.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It could be that there is plenty of free memory on one of the other hosts.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a way for openmpi to use the memory on one of the other hosts when the memory on one host is gone.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;If yes please tell me how.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you.
<br>
<p><p>With Blessings, always,
<br>
