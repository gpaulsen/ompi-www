<div dir="ltr">Hi all,<div>I have a custom MPI_Op function which I use within a non blocking version of all_reduce(). When executing the mpi program I am seeing a segfault thrown from libNBC. It seems like this is a known issue in openMPI atleast [1]. Is this somehow fixed in a later release version of openmpi ? I am using 1.8.4.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks</div><div>Udayanga</div><div><br></div><div>[1]Â <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/devel/2014/04/14588.php">http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/devel/2014/04/14588.php</a></div></div>
