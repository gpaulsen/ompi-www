Hello,<br>I finally managed to build openmpi in static library in visual studio ( thanks for your help), and then tried to run a program using<br>mpiexec -n 4 program.exe.<br>The answer to that was :<br>Cannot open configuration file C:/mpidist/installed/share/openmpi\mpiexec-wrapper-data.txt<br>
Error parsing data file mpiexec: Not found<br>I checked and there are *-wrapper-data.txt for the compiler wrappers ( in the folder &quot;share&quot;) but nothing for mpiexec. In addition, I did not completely understand openmpi philosophy, mpic++ are supposed to be compiler wrapper, but when are they used in the process ? and what about exact mpiexec and mpirun roles ? I find it quite difficult to get a proper documentation and to understand the whole picture. Could you pls direct me to a good source of info or explain quickly how the project is structured ?<br>
Regards,<br>Gilles<br>
