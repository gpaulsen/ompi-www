Hello everyone,<br><br>I&#39;m using OpenMPI 1.4.2 with BLCR 0.8.2 to test checkpointing on 2 nodes but it failed to restart (Segmentation fault).<br>Here are the details concerning my problem:<br><br>+ OS: Centos 5.4<br>+ OpenMPI configure:<br>
./configure --with-ft=cr --enable-ft-thread --enable-mpi-threads \<br>--with-blcr=/home/nguyen/opt/blcr --with-blcr-libdir=/home/nguyen/opt/blcr/lib \<br>--prefix=/home/nguyen/opt/openmpi \<br>--enable-mpirun-prefix-by-default<br>
+ mpirun -am ft-enable-cr -machinefile host ./test<br><br>I checkpointed the test program using &quot;ompi-checkpoint -v -s PID&quot; and the checkpoint file was created successfully. However it failed to restart using ompi-restart:<br>
<i>&quot;mpirun noticed that process rank 0 with PID 21242 on node rc014.local exited on signal 11 (Segmentation fault)&quot;<br></i><br>Did I miss something in the installation of OpenMPI?<br> <br>Regards,<br>Nguyen Toan<br>
