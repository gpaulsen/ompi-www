&gt;&gt;&nbsp;either&nbsp;install&nbsp;openmpi&nbsp;on&nbsp;each&nbsp;node,&nbsp;and&nbsp;setup&nbsp;&nbsp;/etc/profile.d/openmpi.{c,}sh&nbsp;and&nbsp;/etc/ld.so.conf.d/openmpi.conf&nbsp;files&nbsp;on&nbsp;both&nbsp;(preferred)&nbsp;or&nbsp;install&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;common&nbsp;file&nbsp;system&nbsp;(e.g.&nbsp;nfs&nbsp;mount)&nbsp;and&nbsp;still&nbsp;use&nbsp;profile&nbsp;and&nbsp;ldconfig&nbsp;to&nbsp;setup&nbsp;environment.
&gt;
<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I choose to install openmpi on each mode.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; But I dont know the difference between the following the two methods 
in setting PATH. First method, I set PATH ans LD_LIBRARY_PATH in 
.bashrc and then source .bashrc. The second as Dani suggested. But it seems not easy to set 
openmpi.csh. <br><br>&gt;Where&nbsp;was&nbsp;Open&nbsp;MPI&nbsp;installed&nbsp;to?&nbsp;Maybe&nbsp;you&nbsp;need&nbsp;to&nbsp;set&nbsp;the&nbsp;$PATH&nbsp;for&nbsp;a&nbsp;non-interactive&nbsp;login&nbsp;in&nbsp;your&nbsp;~/.bashrc&nbsp;to&nbsp;include&nbsp;this&nbsp;location&nbsp;on&nbsp;the&nbsp;slave&nbsp;node.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I install openmpi at /usr/local/openmpi-1.6.5 on both computers. and the two computers now can access each other without passwd required. I set the path and ld_library_path in .bashrc and source it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I still get the problems as before. In detail, the problem is as follows:<br><br>&nbsp;bash: orted: command not found<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>A daemon (pid 9118) died unexpectedly with status 127 while attempting<br>to launch so we are aborting.<br><br>There may be more information reported by the environment (see above).<br><br>This may be because the daemon was unable to find all the needed shared<br>libraries on the remote node. You may set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to have the<br>location of the shared libraries on the remote nodes and this will<br>automatically be forwarded to the remote nodes.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>mpiexec noticed that the job aborted, but has no info as to the process<br>that caused that situation.<br>Thank you.<br>Best regards,<br>meng<br></div><br><br><span title="neteasefooter"><span id="netease_mail_footer"></span></span>
