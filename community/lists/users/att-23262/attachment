<div dir="ltr"><div><div><div>Hi All,<br><br></div><div>I have a question similar (but not identical to) the one asked by Tom Fogel a week or so back...<br></div><div><br></div>I have a code that uses MPI_Comm_spawn to launch different processes. The executables for these use libraries in non-standard locations, so what I&#39;ve done is add the directories containing them to my LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable, and then calling mpirun with &quot;-x LD_LIBRARY_PATH&quot;. This works well for me on OpenMPI 1.6.3 and earlier. However, I&#39;ve been playing with OpenMPI 1.7.3 and this no longer seems to work. As soon as my code MPI_Comm_spawns, all the spawned processes die complaining that they can&#39;t find the correct libraries to start the executable.<br>
<br>Has there been a way that exported variables are passed to spawned processes between OpenMPI 1.6 and 1.7? Is there something else I&#39;m doing wrong here?<br><br></div>Best Regards,<br></div>Tim<br></div>
