In my diploma thesis I need to write a program in C++ using MPI that will execute another external program - an optimization software GAMS. My question is wheter is sufficient to use simply the command <font face="&#39;courier new&#39;, monospace">system();</font> for executing GAMS. In other words, will the external program &quot;work&quot; in parallel? If the question is &#39;Yes&#39;, does someone know whether it will work also with LAM/MPI instead of OpenMPI?</div>
<div><br></div><div>Thank you for the answer.</div><div><br></div><div>Best regards,</div><div>Lubajz</div></span>
