  <div>I am new user of Open MPI, I've used MPICH before.<br>
  <br>
There is performance bug with the following scenario:<br>
  <br>
proc_B:&nbsp; MPI_Isend(...,proc_A,..,&amp;request)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; do{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sleep(1);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; MPI_Test(..,&amp;flag,&amp;request);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; count++<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }while(!flag);<br>
  <br>
proc_A: MPI_Recv(...,proc_B);<br>
  <br>
For message size 8MB,&nbsp; proc_B calls MPI_Test 88 times. It means that
point to point communication costs 88 seconds.<br>
Btw, bandwidth isn't the problem (interconnection network: InfiniBand)<br>
  <br>
Obviously, there is the problem with progress of the asynchronous
messages.<br>
  <br>
How can I avoid this problem?<br>
  </div>

I'm no expert, but I think the problem is that the send is being
"progressed" (advanced) only during MPI calls and MPI_Test doesn't
progress/advance the message very aggressively.&nbsp; The message is
probably being decomposed into chunks and MPI_Test will advance the
message at most one chunk at a time.&nbsp; So:<br>
<br>
1) You could decrease the time between MPI_Test calls.<br>
2) You could block (e.g., with MPI_Wait).<br>
<br>
It's a tough tradeoff to make.&nbsp; That's bad news... but do you want OMPI
to be making the tough choices here for you?&nbsp; Let's say the sending
process sends a chunk and it takes a little while for the receiver to
process data and make room for you to send some more.&nbsp; During that
waiting time, should the sender return control to the user application,
or stay blocked inside of MPI_Test?<br>
<br>
Anyhow, I believe that's the issue here.<br><br>In order to overlap communication and computation I don't want to use MPI_Wait. For sure the message is being decomposed into chucks and the size of chuck is probably defined by environment variable. <br>Maybe do you know how can I control size of chuck?<br>Thanks<br><br>Vladimir<br>
