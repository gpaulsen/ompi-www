<p style="margin-bottom:0cm" lang="en-US">Hi all, I have a question
related to Open MPI btl_tcp module. How to slow down OMPI in terms of
network utilization ? My OpenMPI  based application (lets call it
APP1) is sharing hardware components with other software (lets call it APP2)
which is very sensitive on network saturation. The APP2 suffers from
lost “KEEP_ALIVE_RESPONSE” like tcp packages. Things are more
complicated because of below described architecture constraints or
other reasons:</p><ul><li>We are using Open MPI
	version 1.4.3 and we rather do not want to migrate to newer version
	right now</li><li><span id="result_box" class="short_text" lang="en"><span class="hps alt-edited">computational</span></span> nodes have a some company internal Linux distribution (2.6.x core version)<br></li><li>I&#39;ve done some
	external patches on OMPI 1.4.3 source codes in order to address
	problem with lack of support for the multiple NIC aliases (in
	conjunction with bonds) by OMPI.</li></ul><ol><ol><li>Ifconfig says us
		that on every node we have 3 NIC aliases (3 different IP and names with
		pattern such as: xxx0, xxx0:0, xxx0:1) in conjunction with bond
		configuration (all have the same <font>HWaddr</font>)</li></ol></ol><ul><li>M<span lang="en-US">y
