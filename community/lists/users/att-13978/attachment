<br><font face="sans-serif" size="2">I am confused about using multiple,
concurrent mpirun operations. &nbsp;If there are M uses of mpirun and each
starts N tasks (carried out under pvm or any other way) I would expect
you to have M completely independent MPI jobs with N tasks (processes)
each. &nbsp;You could have some root in each of the M MPI jobs do an MPI_Bcast
to the other N-1) in that job but there is no way in MPI (without using
accept.connect) to get tasks of job 0 to give data to tasks of jobs 1-(m-1).</font>
<br>
<br><font face="sans-serif" size="2">With M uses of mpirun, you have M worlds
that are forever isolated from the other M-1 worlds (again, unless you
do accept/connect)</font>

<br><font face="sans-serif" size="2">In what sense are you treating this
as an single MxN application? &nbsp; ( I use M &amp; N to keep them distinct.
I assume if M == N, we have your case)</font>
