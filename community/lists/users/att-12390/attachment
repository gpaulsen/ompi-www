Hello,<br>when looking at <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/users/2010/01/11892.php" target="_blank">http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/users/2010/01/11892.php</a>,
 I realized I have the same exact error when linkin C++ programs (<span>error
 LNK2019: unresolved external symbol &quot;void 
</span><br>
<span>&gt; __cdecl MPI::InitializeIntercepts(void)&quot; 
</span><br>
<span>&gt; (?InitializeIntercepts_at_MPI@@YAXXZ)
</span><br>
<span>&gt; referenced in function &quot;void __cdecl 
MPI::Real_init(void)&quot; 
</span><br>
<span>&gt; (?Real_init_at_MPI@@YAXXZ)mpi_gather.exe : 
fatal error LNK1120: 1 
</span><br>
<span>&gt; unresolved externals)<br><br>Did someone manage to get around
 this ? I managed to get openmpi working on linux with C++ programs, but
 no chance with windows....would be glad to get some help on this.<br>
Thanks<br>Gilles</span>
