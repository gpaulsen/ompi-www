        <pre>This is another &quot;bug/feature&quot; in SGE: it&#39;s a matter of discussion, whether the shepherd should get exactly one core (in case you use more than one `qrsh`per node) for each call, or *all* cores assigned (which we need right now, as the processes in Open MPI will be forks of orte daemon). About such a situtation I filled an issue a long time ago and &quot;limit_to_one_qrsh_per_host yes/no&quot; in the PE definition would do (this setting should then also change the core allocation of the master process):

I believe this is indeed the crux of the issue

          <pre>3. tell OMPI to --bind-to-core.

In other words, tell SGE to allocate a certain number of cores on each node, but to bind each proc to all of them (i.e., don&#39;t bind a proc to a specific core). I&#39;m pretty sure that is a standard SGE option today (at least, I know it used to be). I don&#39;t believe any patch or devel work is required (to either SGE or OMPI).

        <pre>When you use a fixed allocation_rule and a matching -binding request it will work today. But any other case won&#39;t be distributed in the correct way.

Is it possible to not include the -binding request? If SGE is told to use a fixed allocation_rule, and to allocate (for example) 2 cores/node, then won&#39;t the orted see 
itself bound to two specific cores on each node?

      </blockquote>
      <pre>When you leave out the -binding, all jobs are allowed to run on any core.

        <pre>We would then be okay as the spawned children of orted would inherit its binding. Just don&#39;t tell mpirun to bind the processes and the threads of those MPI procs will be able to operate across the provided cores.

Or does SGE only allocate 2 cores/node in that case (i.e., allocate, but no -binding given), but doesn&#39;t bind the orted to any two specific cores? If so, then that would be a problem as the orted would think itself unconstrained. If I understand the thread correctly, you&#39;re saying that this is what happens today - true?
</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <pre>Exactly. It won&#39;t apply any binding at all and orted would think of being unlimited. I.e. limited only by the number of slots it should use thereon.

    So I guess the question I have for Ralph.  I thought, and this might
    be mixing some of the ideas Jeff and I&#39;ve been talking about, that
    when a RM executes the orted with a bound set of resources (ie
    cores) that orted would bind the individual processes on a subset of
    the bounded resources.  Is this not really the case for 1.4.X
    branch?  I believe it is the case for the trunk based on Jeff&#39;s
    refactoring.</div></blockquote><div><br></div><div>You are absolutely correct, Terry, and the 1.4 release series does include the proper code. The point here, though, is that SGE binds the orted to a single core, even though other cores are also allocated. So the orted detects an external binding of one core, and binds all its children to that same core.</div>
<div><br></div><div>What I had suggested to Reuti was to not include the -binding flag to SGE in the hopes that SGE would then bind the orted to all the allocated cores. However, as I feared, SGE in that case doesn&#39;t bind the orted at all - and so we assume the entire node is available for our use.</div>
<div><br></div><div>This is an SGE issue. We need them to bind the orted to -all- the allocated cores (and only those cores) in order for us to operate correctly.</div><div><br></div><div> </div><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;">
