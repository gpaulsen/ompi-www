Hi, so yes I&#39;m trying to install the source but after installing, it does not seem to be able to locate the libraries.<br><br>mpirun gives the error<br>libopen-rte.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory<br>
<br>Of course, I have seen this faq <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=running#adding-ompi-to-path">http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=running#adding-ompi-to-path</a><br><br>But this is more than a little beyond me.  The libraries seem to be installed in usr/lib, (at least, that&#39;s where it locates the library in question.) but I can&#39;t seem to get this to work by modifying LD_LIBRARY_PATH, or using the --prefix switch.  Obviously I am doing something very wrong, never having bothered with editing paths before. (This is why I use packages.)  <br>

&gt; So I checked the OMPI package details on both machines, they each are running Open MPI 1.3. . . but then I noticed that the packages are different versions.   Basically, the slave is running the previous Ubuntu release, and the master is running the current one. Both have the most recent packages for their release. . .but perhaps that is enough of a difference?<br>

</div>You need to have exactly the same version of OpenMPI installed on both machines.  Typically in a cluster all machines are identical in terms of software, if this isn&#39;t the case for your systems then the easiest way might be to compile open mpi from source (on the older of the two machines would be best) and to install it to a common directory on both machines.<br>
