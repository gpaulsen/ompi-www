mpicc *.c -I$OPENMPI_HOME/include where the "HOME" directories were
specified with --prefix= when you installed.  Hope this helps.  This

&gt; I have both openmpi and MPICH on my cluster, the problem is that mpi.h of

openmpi
&gt; and this works fine, but then mpi.h itself includes mpicxx.h which it
again
&gt; includes openmpi's mpi.h and this is my problem becase the system goes
and
&gt; takes the mpi.h file of MPICH which is in /usr/local/include and thus i
get
&gt; errors segfaults! I am using mpicc wrapper to compile my code and i think
my
&gt; problem is due to having other mpi.h files. Am I right?? What should I do
to
&gt; make /usr/local/include in-accesible from my code??? Please help me!
