      <br>
      <br>
      I would like you to ask for a topic that there are already many
      questions but I am not familiar a lot with it. I want to
      understand the behaviour of an application where there are many
      messages less than 64KB (eager mode) and I use TCP network. I am
      trying to understand in order to simulate this application.
      <br>
      For example it can be possible to have one MPI_Send of 1200 bytes
      after some computation, then two messages of the same size, after
      computation, etc. However according to the measurements and the
      profiling the cost of the communication is less than the latency
      of the network. I can understand that the cost of the MPI_Send is
      the copy to the buffer however sending the message to the
      destination it should cost at least the latency. So are the
      messages buffered in the sender and they are sent as packet to the
      receiver? My tcp window is 4MB and I use the same value for
      snd_buff and rcv_buff. If they are buffered in the sender what is
      the criterion/algorithm? I mean if I have one message, after
      computation and after again message is it possible these two
      messages to be buffered from the sender point of view or this
      happens only on the receiver? If there is any document/paper that
      I can read about this I would be appreciate to provide me the
      link.
      <br>
      A simple example is that if I have a loop that rank 0 sends two
      messages to rank 1 then the duration of the first message is
      bigger than the second's one and if I increase the loop to 10 or
      20 messages then all the messages cost a lot less than the first
      one and also less from what SkaMPI measures. So I am sure that it
      should be a buffer issue (or something else that I can't think
      about).

      Best regards,
      <br>
