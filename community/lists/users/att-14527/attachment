<div><br></div><div>Thanks a lot for your reply. By commenting code B, I mean if I remove the code B part, then the time spent on code A seems to run faster. I do have a lot of communications in code B too. It involves 500 procs. I had thought code B should have no effect on the time spent on code A if I use MPI_Barrier.</div>

&gt; I need to measure t2-t1 to see the time spent on the code A between these two MPI_Barriers. I notice that if I comment code B, the time seems much less the original time (almost half). How does it happen? What is a possible reason for it? I have no idea.<br>

</div>I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re asking here -- do you mean that if you put some comments in code B, it takes much less time than if you don&#39;t put comments?  If so, then the comments have nothing to do with the execution run-time -- something else is going on that is causing the delay.  Some questions:<br>

<br>
- how long does it take to execute code B -- microseconds, or seconds, or ...?<br>
- how many processes are involved?<br>
- what are you doing in code B; is it communication intensive and/or do you synchronize with other processes?<br>
- are you doing your timings on otherwise-empty machines?<br>
