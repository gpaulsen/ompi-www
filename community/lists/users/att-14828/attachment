Hi there,<div><br></div><div>Thanks for the expedite reply. The thing is that although the mpirun is setup correctly (since a simple hello world works), when I run the main SWMF.exe executable, the cluster machines somehow fail to find the executable (SWMF.exe). </div>
<div><br></div><div>So, I have attached the sample error file from one of the runs (SWMF.e143438) and also the MAKEFILES so that you could better gauge the problem. The makefiles have Linux as the OS and pgf90 as compiler with mpif90 as the linker. I am using openmpi-1.2.7-pgi. Job is submitted using a batch file (job.bats) and the scheduler is Torque (version I am not sure but I can see three on the machines viz 2.0.0, 2.2.1, 2.5.2).</div>
<div><br></div><div>I have also attached an error file from one of the clusters (WASATCH viz SWMF.e143439) and UINTA (SWMF.e143440) with the <b>whole path of the exe as Srirangam mentioned as follows (in the batch file)</b>.</div>
<div><br></div><div>mpirun --prefix /opt/libraries/openmpi/openmpi-1.2.7-pgi   /home/A00945081/SWMF_v2.3/run/SWMF.exe &gt; runlog_`date +%y%m%d%H%M`</div><div><br></div><div>I have tried both mpirun and mpiexec but nothing seems to work.</div>

Have you tried supplying the full path of the executable just to check ?<br>

Subject: [OMPI users] Unable to find the following executable<br>
<div><div></div><div class="h5"><br>
Hi there,<br>
<br>
I am new to using mpi commands and was stuck in problem with running a code. When I submit my job through a batch file, the job exits with the message that the executable could not be found on the machines. I have tried a lot of options such as PBS -V and so on on but the problem persists. If someone is interested, I can send the full info on the cluster, the compiler and openmpi settings and other stuff. BTW the launcher is torque (which you might have guessed). The code does not have a forum so I am in a deep mire.<br>

<br>
Thanks,<br>
Tushar<br>
