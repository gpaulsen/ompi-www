It won't *fix* the problem -- you're still oversubscribing the nodes,

Yes. I meant "solving the blocking problem by letting others get some
CPU time" by "fix".<br>

I'm not sure what you mean by this -- you should not "lie" to OMPI  
and tell it that it has more slots than it physically does.  But keep  
in mind that, as I described in my first mail, OMPI does not  
currently re-compute the number of processes on a host as you spawn  
(which can lead to the oversubscription problem).  If you're  
explicitly setting yield_when_idle, that *may* help, but we may or  
may not be explicitly propoagating that value to spawned  
processes...  I'll have to check.

In the hostfile I specified for each host the number of physically
available cores. Together with the "yield" setting I hoped the
oversubscription would be recognised even if the "oversubscribing"
processes are dynamically started.<br>
I re-checked the high/low parameter, but it does seem alright. Would be
kind of awkward for this to be the reason, as the problem seems to
depend on the host and the order.<br>
