Hi,
<div class=""><br class="">
</div>
<div class="">We are currently testing OpenMPI and I would like to ask you few questions related to it.</div>
<div class=""><br class="">
</div>
<div class="">While looking at performance and control variables provided by the MPI_T interface, I was surprised by the impressive number of control variables (1,087 if I am right (with 1.8.4)) but I was also disappointed to see that I was able to get only
 2 performance variables.</div>
<div class="">I would to know if you are planning to add more Performance variables like number of time an algorithm from a collective was called, or the number of buffer allocated/free etc…</div>
<div class=""><br class="">
</div>
<div class="">Regarding collective tuning, I was wondering if you can recommend me a paper/presentation that will provide most of the details. I found some interesting posts (like this one:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/users/2014/11/25847.php" class="">http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/users/2014/11/25847.php</a>)
 but I am looking for a paper/doc explaining the different modules (basic, tuned, self, hierarchical…) and how to set dynamic rules&nbsp;</div>
<div class=""><br class="">
</div>
<div class="">Thanks,</div>
<div class="">Jerome</div>
