<div class="gmail_extra">Dear All,<br><div class="gmail_quote"><div class="gmail_extra"><div class="gmail_quote"><div><br></div><div>I am having problem with running an application on Dell cluster . The model starts well but no further progress is shown. It just stuck. I have checked the systems, no apparent hardware error is there. Other open mpi applications are running well on the same cluster. I have tried running the application on cores of the same server as well but the problem is same. The application just don&#39;t move further. The same application is also running well on a backup cluster. Please help.</div>
