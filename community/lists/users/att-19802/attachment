Hello <div><br></div><div>I am working on a mpi program. I have been printing the addresses of different variables and arrays using the MPI_GET_ADDRESS command. What I have noticed is that all the processors are giving the same address of a particular variable as long as the address is less than 2 GB size. When the address of a variable/ array is more than 2GB size different processors are giving different addresses for the same variable. (I am working on a 64 bit system and am using the new MPI Functions and MPI_ADDRESS_KIND integers for getting the addresses).</div>
<div><br></div><div>my question is that should all the processors give the same address for same variables? If so then why is this not happening for variables with larger addresses.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>
thanks</div><div>priyesh</div><div><br></div>
