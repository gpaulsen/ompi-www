According to the mpi_finalize documentation, a call to mpi_finalize terminate all processes.  I have ran into this problem before where one process calls mpi_finalize before other processes reach the same line of code and cause errors/hang ups.  Put a mpi_barrier(mpi_comm_world) before mpi_finalize would do the trick.<br>

Hello,<br><br>I&#39;m having trouble with some MPI programming in Fortran, using openmpi.<br>It seems that my program doesn&#39;t work unless I print some unrelated text to the screen. For example, if I have this situation:<br>

<br>*** hundreds of lines cut ***<br>IF (irank .eq. 0) THEN<br>    CALL print_results1(variable)<br>    CALL print_results2(more_variable)<br>END IF<br>print *, &quot;done&quot;, irank<br>CALL MPI_FINALIZE(ierr)<br>END PROGRAM calculation<br>

<br>The results are not printed unless I include this &quot;print done irank&quot; penultimate line.<br>Also, despite seeing that all ranks reach the print statement, the program hangs, as if they have not all reached MPI_FINALIZE.<br>

<br>Can anyone help me? Why does it do this?<br><br>I also had many times where the program would crash if I didn&#39;t include a print statement in a loop. I&#39;ve been doing Fortran programming for a while, and this is my nightmare debugging scenario since I&#39;ve never been able to figure out why the simple printing of statements magically fixes the program, and I usually end up having to go back to a serial solution, which is really slow.<br>

<br>If anyone might be able to help me, I would be really really grateful!!<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Tom<br><br> 		 	   		  </div>
