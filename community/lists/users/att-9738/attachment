Hi all,<div><br></div><div>I am new to OpenMPI, and have an urgent run-time question. I have openmpi-1.3.2 compiled with Intel Fortran compiler v.11 simply by</div><div><br></div><div>./configure --prefix=&lt;my-dir&gt; F77=ifort FC=ifort </div>
<div>then I set my LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include &lt;openmpi-lib&gt; and &lt;intel-lib&gt;</div><div>and compile my Fortran program properly. No compilation error. </div><div><br></div><div>I run my program on single node. Everything looks ok. However, when I run it on multiple nodes.</div>
<div>mpirun -np &lt;num&gt; --hostfile &lt;my-hosts&gt; &lt;my-program&gt; </div><div>The performance is much worse than a single node with the same size of the problem to solve (MPICH2 has 50% improvement) </div><div><br>
</div><div>I use top and saidar to find that user time (CPU user) is much lower than system time (CPU system), i.e,</div><div>only small portion of CPU time is used by user application, while the rest is busy with system. </div>
<div>No wonder I got bad performance.  I am assuming &quot;CPU system&quot; is used for MPI communication. </div><div>I notice the total traffic (on eth0) is not that big (~5Mb/sec). What is CPU system busy for? </div><div>
<br></div><div>Can anyone help? Anything I need to tune? </div><div><br></div><div>Thanks in advance</div><div><br></div><div>-Qiming</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br clear="all"><br>
