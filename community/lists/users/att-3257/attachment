<br>Hi,<br><br>One more question with respect to running OpenMPI on my AlphaServers<br>and other PCs in my lab.<br><br>Version 1.2.1 fails to build on the AlphaServers, but miraculously the<br>nightly snapshot openmpi-1.3a1r14639 works fine. Now, I need to have<br>OpenMPI set up on a production cluster, but openmpi-1.3XXX is under<br>active development.....<br>What is recommended to use in this case for my cluster system?<br>I would prefer that the appropriate fix also be applied to 1.2.x series,<br>so that I can rely on the a stable version ?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Rob.<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span><strong><a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/nightly/v1.2/"><strong></strong></a><br></strong><p>&#32;
