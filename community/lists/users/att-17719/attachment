Hi all,<br>        I have been trying to compile and run openmpi-1.4.4 using SUSE Linux 11.4 on VMware 7.0.1 and have run into difficulties. I used the intel compilers composerXE-2011.5.220 both C and fortran.  Both of these compilers and and openmpi-1.4.4 appeared to compiler properly since I did not see any errors in the config.out, make.out and install.out files.  However, when I tried to run the mpicc programs in the examples file it gave the output shown on the attached file.  I have tried to find the files that are listed as not found in the attached file they are not found. I have checked the file permissions and all seems to be in order.  <br>
        At this point I do not know what to do and would appreciate any advice.  <br>                                                                                                        Amos Leffler<br><br>
