libmpi_cxx.so.1 to code which I am workign on it, I export the library 
to LD_LIBRARY_PATH. But whenever I do this, I get this error:<br>Fatal error in MPI_Comm_dup: Invalid communicator, error stack:<br>
MPI_Comm_dup(168): MPI_Comm_dup(comm=0x0, new_comm=0x7fff39826eac) failed<br>MPI_Comm_dup(96).: Invalid communicator<br><br></div>It
 might be possible that I have several openmpi in my linux machine and 
the code could not recognize right one. I just have this library in 
these two path: /usr/lib64/openmpi/lib/ and /usr/local/lib/, but none of
 them is not working in my case. Installed openmpi in my machine is 
openmpi-1.5.4-3.fc16.x86_64 and I am working with Fedora.<br>
</div>Does anybody can help me to figure out this problem?<br><br></div>Thanks,<br>Ami</div></body></html>
