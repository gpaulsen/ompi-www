Hi everyone, <br>I want to install OpenMPI on my Ubuntu 8.10 64bit PC. My first attempt to install it was through the ubuntu package manager. From the synaptic manager I found, downloaded and installed OpenMPI 1.2.7 version. Unfortunately the installation package did not allow any configuration options in order to define the desired compilers as F77,F90 etc and when I type mpif77 for example I get the message<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Unfortunately, this installation of Open MPI was not compiled with<br>Fortran 77 support.  As such, the mpif77 compiler is non-functional.<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I tried to uninstall this version of the MPI but I was not able to completely remove it. To explain what I mean : after removing it through the synaptic manager when I type the mpirun command in terminal I get the same message as above. Can anyone tell me what files do I have to remove so that I can completely clean my PC from that version and install an other version which will allow customizations? Alternatively is there any way to define the compilers after the MPI installation? <br>

<br>Now regarding a new clean installation of OpenMPI  : What version do you suggest me install on my pc? Is the latest version (1.3.2) stable enough? <br>As far as I have read in the readme/ installation documents to install the version 1.3.2 I have to run the ./configure command adding the --prefix=/installation/location and F77=77 fortran compiler ,etc (where fortran compiler is just the compilers name e.g. ifort not its location on the filesystem) and after that make all install, is that correct? Can I install OpenMPI at any directory or should I install it in the compiler&#39;s installation path?<br>

 Do I have to make any other customization in the .bashrc in order OpenMPI to operate? If yes what do I have to add ? <br><br>I am a relatively new user in linux so detailed instruction would be appreciated. I am looking fowrward hearing from anyone who could help.<br>

Thanks in advance.  <br><br> <br>
