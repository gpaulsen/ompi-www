Hi,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I have been tracing the interactions between the PERUSE and MPI
library,on one
machine. I have been using gdb along with xterm to have two windows
open at the same time as I step through the code. I wish to get a
better glimpse of the working of the point to point calls, by launching
the job on two machines and by tracing the flow in a similar manner.
This is where I stand as of now :<br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">mpirun --prefix /usr/local -hostfile machines&nbsp; -np 2 xterm -e gdb peruse_ex1</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">
<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">xterm Xt error: Can&#39;t open display:</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">
<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">xterm:&nbsp; DISPLAY is not set</span><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I tried using the display option for xterm and setting the value as
0.0, that was not of much help. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If someone can guide me as to where the DISPLAY parameter has to be set
to allow the remote machine to open the xterm window, it will be of
great help.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
Krishna <br>
