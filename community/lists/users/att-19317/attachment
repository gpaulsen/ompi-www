      <br>
      <br>
      We are starting studying replication for MPI applications. A few
      papers have been published in the last months on this topic.
      <br>
      <br>
      We were wondering if anybody has already started working on
      providing process replication in Open MPI ? And if yes, is there
      some code available ?
      <br>
      <br>
      Best regards,
      <br>
      <br>
