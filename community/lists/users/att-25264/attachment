&gt; Just saw this, sorry. Our srun is indeed a shell script. It seems to be a wrapper around the regular srun that runs a --task-prolog. What it does...that&#39;s beyond my ken, but I could ask. My guess is that it probably does something that helps keep our old PBS scripts running (sets $PBS_NODEFILE, say). We used to run PBS but switched to SLURM recently. The admins would, of course, prefer all future scripts be SLURM-native scripts, but there are a lot of production runs that uses many, many PBS scripts. Converting that would need slow, careful QC to make sure any &quot;pure SLURM&quot; versions act as expected.<br>

</div>Ralph and I haven&#39;t had a chance to discuss this in detail yet, but I have thought about this quite a bit.<br>
<br>
What is happening is that one of the $argv OMPI passes is of the form &quot;foo;bar&quot;.  Your srun script is interpreting the &quot;;&quot; as the end of the command the the &quot;bar&quot; as the beginning of a new command, and mayhem ensues.<br>


<br>
Basically, your srun script is violating what should be a very safe assumption: that the $argv we pass to it will not be interpreted by a shell.  Put differently: your &quot;srun&quot; script behaves differently than SLURM&#39;s &quot;srun&quot; executable.  This violates OMPI&#39;s expectations of how srun should behave.<br>


<br>
My $0.02 is that if we &quot;fix&quot; this in OMPI, we&#39;re effectively penalizing all other SLURM installations out there that *don&#39;t* violate this assumption (i.e., all of them).  Ralph may disagree with me on this point, BTW -- like I said, we haven&#39;t talked about this in detail since Tuesday.  :-)<br>


<br>
So here&#39;s my question: is there any chance you can change your &quot;srun&quot; script to a script language that doesn&#39;t recombine $argv?  This is a common problem, actually -- sh/csh/etc. script languages tend to recombine $argv, but other languages such as perl and python do not (e.g., <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6981533/how-to-preserve-single-and-double-quotes-in-shell-script-arguments-without-the-a" target="_blank">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6981533/how-to-preserve-single-and-double-quotes-in-shell-script-arguments-without-the-a</a>).<br>
