The mpif90 is the one you think it is (e.g., run "which mpif90" and ensure that you're getting the "right" mpif90)<br><br>&gt;2. Ensure that
 your Open MPI has f90 support compiled in.&nbsp; Run "ompi_info | grep -i fort" and look at the output to ensure that your OMPI installation &gt;has F90 support compiled in.<br><br>I tested both of them. They seem good.<br> </div> </div>  </div></body></html>
