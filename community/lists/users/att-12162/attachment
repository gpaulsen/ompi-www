&gt; Thanks alot for your reply,<br>

&gt; I&#39;m using blocking Send and Receive. All the clients are sending data<br>
&gt; and the server is receive the messages from the clients with<br>
&gt; MPI_ANY_SOURCE as the sender. Do you think there is a race condition<br>
&gt; near this pattern?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I searched a lot and used totalview but I couldn&#39;t detect such case. I<br>
&gt; really appreciate if you send me a link or give an example of a possible<br>
&gt; race condition in that scenario .<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Also, when I partition the message into smaller parts (send in sequence<br>
&gt; - all the other clients wait until the send finish) it works fine. is<br>
&gt; that exclude the race condition?<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
</div>It sounds like, when sending the large messages, you are putting more<br>
data into a buffer than it can hold. When you break the messages up into<br>
 smaller sizes, you&#39;re not overflowing the buffer.<br>
<br>
Are you using MPI_Pack, by any chance?<br>
