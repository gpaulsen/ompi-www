@Gus, Eugene<br>I read all you mails and even followed the same procedure, it was blas that was giving the problem.<br><br>Thanks<br><br> I am again stuck on a problem, i connected a new node to my cluster and installed CentOS 5.2 on it. after that i use yum to install openmpi,openmpi-libs and openmpi-devel sucessfully.<br>
<br>But still when i run mpicc command it gives me error :<br><i style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">bash: mpicc: command not found</i><br><br>i found out there is a command <b>mpi-selector</b> but dont know hoe to use it.<br>
Is this a new version of openmpi? how do i configure it?<br><br>
