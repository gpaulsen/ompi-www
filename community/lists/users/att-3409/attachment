I compiled openmpi-1.2.2 with:<br><br>./configure CFLAGS=-g -pg -O3 --prefix=/home/foo/490_research/490/src/mpi.optimized_profiling/&nbsp; \<br>--enable-mpi-threads --enable-progress-threads --enable-static --disable-shared --without-memory-manager&nbsp; \
<br>--without-libnuma --disable-mpi-f77 --disable-mpi-f90 --disable-mpi-cxx --disable-mpi-cxx-seek --disable-dlopen<br><br>(Thanks Jeff, now I know that I have to add --without-memory-manager and --without-libnuma for static linking)
<br><br>make all<br><br>make install<br><br>then I run my client app with:<br><br>/home/foo/490_research/490/src/mpi.optimized_profiling/bin/mpirun --hostfile ../hostfile -n 32 raytrace -finputs/car.env<br><br>The program runs well and each process completes succssfully (I can tell because all processes have now generated 
gmon.out successfully and a &quot;ps aux&quot; on other slave nodes (except the originating node) show that my program in slave nodes have already exited (not existant).&nbsp; Therefore I think this may have something to do with mpirun,which hangs forever.
<br><br>Can you see anything wrong in my ./configure command which explains the mpirun hang at the end of the run?&nbsp; How can I fix it?<br><br>Thanks!<br>
