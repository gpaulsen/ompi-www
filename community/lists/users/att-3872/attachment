I am trying to run one of the NPB2.4 benchmarks over two nodes. On each node I can run the benchmark on just that node, but when I try to run it across the two I get an error &quot;bash: orted: command not found&quot;. The openmpi bin directory is in the PATH on both nodes. I can type &quot;orted&quot; in and I don&#39;t get a command not found error.
<br><br>Run command on a single node: mpirun -np 2 cg.C.2<br>Run command on two nodes: mpirun -np 2 -host shrek,fiona cg.C.2<br><br>Any idea what I&#39;m doing wrong?<br>
