Hello,<br><br>i got an algorithm that generates trees, of different sizes, recursively. at the moment i have the algorithm in its secuential version.<br><br>here we have 4 identical computers with Xeon 8-core in each node + 4gb ram. they have HyperThreading so they count as 16-processors per node.<br>

so i can launch a total of 64 parallel threads.<br><br>my question is, what could be the best approach when using MPI.???<br><br>assigning -np 64 maybe is not a good idea, because i would not be taking advantage of the vecinity of cores which could improve memory tasks speeds, i mean it might be better to have 4 mpi processes and each one of these spawn 15 threads locally???...(can i mix MPI with local threads right? )<br>

<br>i dont have much experience in MPI, i only programmed bigger algorithms in CUDA which is much easier.<br>any suggestions or help is welcome<br>Cristobal<br><br><br><br><br><span style="color: black;"><div dir="ltr"><div>
