<div dir="ltr"><div><div><div>Hello developers<br><br></div>May I request that you add the release dates to the release notes (the NEWS file)? The reason I ask is that some one-of-a-kind hardware or obsolete hardware run very old versions of OpenMPI, and I am asked to maintain that version using a PC platform. I want to know what is the time range of PC hardware/OS release that I should choose that will still run that older release.<br><br></div>Thank you<br></div>Durga<br><div><div><div><div><br><br clear="all"><div><div class="gmail_signature"><div dir="ltr"><div>1% of the executables have 99% of CPU privilege!<br></div>Userspace code!
