Hi, I am completely new to MPI and am having trouble running a job between two  cpus.<br><br>The same thing happens no matter what MPI job I try to run, but here is a simple &#39;hello world&#39; style program I am trying to run.<br>
<br>#include &lt;mpi.h&gt;<br>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br><br>int main(int argc, char **argv)<br>{<br>  int *buf, i, rank, nints, len;<br>  char hostname[256];<br><br>  MPI_Init(&amp;argc,&amp;argv);<br>  MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &amp;rank);<br>
  gethostname(hostname,255);<br>  printf(&quot;Hello world!  I am process number: %d on host %s\n&quot;, rank, hostname);<br>  MPI_Finalize();<br>  return 0;<br>}<br><br><br>On either CPU, I can successfully compile and run, but when trying to run the program using two CPUS it fails with this output:<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>mpirun noticed that the job aborted, but has no info as to the process<br>that caused that situation.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br><br>With no additional information or errors,  What can I do to go about finding out what is wrong?<br><br><br><br>I have read the FAQ and followed the instructions.  I can ssh into the slave without entering a password and have the libraries installed on both machines.<br>
<br>The only thing pertinent I could find is this faq <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=running#missing-prereqs">http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=running#missing-prereqs</a>  but I do not know if it applies since I have installed open mpi from the Ubuntu repositories and assume the libraries are correctly set. <br>
