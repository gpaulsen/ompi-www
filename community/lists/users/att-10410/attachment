I had a look at the OPEN MPI FT user's guide Draft 1.4. but is still unsure.<br><br>I have installed openmpi as follows:<br><br>jean$ ./configure --prefix=/home/jean/openmpi/&nbsp; --enable-debug --enable-mpi-profile --enable-mpi-cxx&nbsp; --enable-binaries --enable-trace --enable-static=yes --enable-debug --with-devel-headers=1 --with-mpi-param-check=always --with-ft=cr --enable-ft-thread --enable-mpi-threads=yes<br><br>jean$ make all install<br><br>MY questions are:<br><br>Q1) Have I properly configured openmpi with self?<br><br>In the document, it is said:<br>"To be absolutely clear: these functions are to be provided by the application - they are not included in the open mpi
 library"<br><br>q2) Does this means that i will have to write my own checkpoint, continue and restart functions and fucntion calls?<br><br>Q3) has anyone experienced with self checkpointing? I would really appreaciate if a guide could be available.<br><br>Thanks a lot<br><br>cheers<br><br>JEan<br></td></tr></table><br>
