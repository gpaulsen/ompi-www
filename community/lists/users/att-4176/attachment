Hi everybody,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a doubt regarding ORTE. One of the major functionality of orte is to maintain GPR, which subscribes and publishes information to the universe. I have a doubt saying, when we submit job from a machine, where does GPR gets created? Is it on the submit machine (HNP)?<br />if YES, then how does compute node gets the information of the same during execution ? Does it use OOB for it ?<br /><br />-Neeraj<br />
