<div dir="ltr">Good morning, Dave,<br><div class="gmail_extra"><br><div class="gmail_quote"><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex">Amongst reasons for not running Docker, a major one that I didn&#39;t notice<br>
raised is that containers are not started by the resource manager, but<br>
by a privileged daemon, so the resource manager can&#39;t directly control<br>
or monitor them.<br></blockquote><div><br></div><div>There&#39;s an <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/676831/">endless debate</a> about this between the docker and systemd folks. It is possible to get at the <a href="https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/6791">underlying process</a> if a resource manager wanted to. </div><div><br></div><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex"><br>
>From a brief look at Jupyter when it came up a while ago, I wouldn&#39;t<br>
want to run it, and I wasn&#39;t alone.  (I&#39;ve been lectured about the lack<br>
of problems with such things by people on whose clusters I could<br>
trivially run jobs as any normal user and sometimes as root.)<br></blockquote><div><br></div><div>Well some people disagree, e.g. <a href="http://ipython.nersc.gov">ipython.nersc.gov</a>.  Our users like Jupyter.

work to be done, you could even convert docker images on the fly in a<br>
resource manager prolog.  I&#39;m awaiting enlightenment on the on-topic<br>
issue of running MPI jobs with it, though.<br><br></blockquote><div><br></div><div>I don&#39;t see how Singularity addresses the problem of starting MPI inside Docker.</div><div><br></div><div>In any event, our current plan is to bypass resource managers completely and start an AWS fleet per user request. The code is much simpler for everybody.</div><div><br></div><div>Rob</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div> </div></div></div></div>
