The line
 
in question in mpicxx.h is:

namespace MPI {

When you use -DMPI, the preprocessor replaces this with:

namespace 1 {

which is not legal.

In short, the application using the name "MPI" is illegal.  That name
 
is reserved for the MPI C++ namespace.  If you change the name to  
something else (like -DUSE_MPI, and change the source code to match),  
this particular problem should be solved.

But then again, I'm not sure why you changed CPP to g++ and CC to gcc;  
shouldn't they be mpicc?

It's also not clear from the context of Makefile.common whether CPP is  
supposed to be the C preprocessor or the C++ compiler.  If it's  
supposed to be the C preprocessor, then "mpicc -E" would be fine; if 

it's supposed to be the C++ compiler, then mpic++ (or mpiCC) would be  
fine.

&gt; Thanks a lot. The problem i have is that i have installed
