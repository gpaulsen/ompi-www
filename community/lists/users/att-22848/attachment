And in practice the difference between FUNNELED and SERIALIZED will be<br>
very small.  The differences might emerge from thread-local state and<br>
thread-specific network registration, but I don&#39;t see this being<br>
required.  Hence, for most purposes SINGLE=FUNNELED=SERIALIZED is<br>
equivalent to NOMUTEX and MULTIPLE is MUTEX, where MUTEX refers to the<br>
internal mutex required to make MPI reentrant.<br>

&gt; I, for the life of me, can&#39;t understand the difference between these two<br>
&gt; init_thread modes.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; MPI_THREAD_SINGLE states that &quot;only one thread will execute&quot;, but<br>
&gt; MPI_THREAD_FUNNELED states &quot;The process may be multi-threaded, but only the<br>
&gt; main thread will make MPI calls (all MPI calls are funneled to the main<br>
&gt; thread).&quot;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; If I use MPI_THREAD_SINGLE, and just create a bunch of pthreads that dumbly<br>
&gt; loop in the background, the MPI library will have no way of detecting this,<br>
&gt; nor should this have any affects on the machine.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; This is exactly the same as MPI_THREAD_FUNNELED. What exactly does it mean<br>
&gt; with &quot;only one thread will execute?&quot; The openmpi library has absolutely zero<br>
&gt; way of knowng I&#39;ve spawned other pthreads, and since these pthreads aren&#39;t<br>
&gt; actually doing MPI communication, I fail to see how this would interfere.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Technically, if you call MPI_INIT_THREAD with MPI_THREAD_SINGLE, you have<br>
&gt; made a promise that you will not create any other threads in your<br>
&gt; application.  There was a time where OSes shipped threaded and non-threaded<br>
&gt; malloc, for example, so knowing that might be important for that last bit of<br>
&gt; performance.  There are also some obscure corner cases of the memory model<br>
&gt; of some architectures where you might get unexpected results if you made an<br>
&gt; MPI Receive call in an thread and accessed that buffer later from another<br>
&gt; thread, which may require memory barriers inside the implementation, so<br>
&gt; there could be some differences between SINGLE and FUNNELED due to those<br>
&gt; barriers.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; In Open MPI, we&#39;ll handle those corner cases whether you init for SINGLE or<br>
&gt; FUNNELED, so there&#39;s really no practical difference for Open MPI, but you&#39;re<br>
&gt; then slightly less portable.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I&#39;m asking because I&#39;m using an open_mpi build ontop of infiniband, and the<br>
&gt; maximum thread mode is MPI_THREAD_SINGLE.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; That doesn&#39;t seem right; which version of Open MPI are you using?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Brian<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; As Brian said, you aren&#39;t likely to be running on a system like Windows 98<br>
&gt; where non-thread-safe libraries were preferred.  My colleagues at NASA<br>
&gt; insist that any properly built MPI will support MPI_THREAD_FUNNELED by<br>
&gt; default, even when the documentation says explicit setting in<br>
&gt; MPI_Init_thread() is mandatory.  The statement which I see in OpenMPI doc<br>
&gt; says all MPI calls must be made by the thread which calls MPI_Init_thread.<br>
&gt; Apparently it will work if plain MPI_Init is used instead.  This theory<br>
&gt; appears to hold up for all the MPI implementations of interest.  The<br>
&gt; additional threads referred to are &quot;inside the MPI rank,&quot; although I suppose<br>
&gt; additional application threads not involved with MPI are possible.<br>
