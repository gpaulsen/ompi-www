I pointed to the insatllation path for BLCR but config complained that
it
      <br>
couldn't find it. If BLCR is only needed for checkpoint / restart then
we can
      <br>
leave without it. Is BLCR needed for suspend/resume of mpi jobs ?

You mean suspend with ctrl-Z?  If so, correct -- BLCR is *only* used
for checkpoint/restart.  Ctrl-Z just uses the SIGSTP functionality.

So BLCR is used for the checkpoint/restart functionality in Open MPI.
We have a webpage with some more details and examples at the link
below:

You should be able to suspend/resume an Open MPI job using
SIGSTOP/SIGCONT without the C/R functionality. We have FAQ item that
talks about how to enable this functionality:
  <br>
  <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=running#suspend-resume">http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=running#suspend-resume</a>
  <br>
  <br>
You can combine the C/R and the SIGSTOP/SIGCONT functionality so that
when you 'suspend' a job a checkpoint is taken and the process is
stopped. You can continue the job by sending SIGCONT as normal.
Additionally, this way if the job needs to be terminated for some
reason (e.g., memory footprint, maintenance), it can be safely
terminated and restarted from the checkpoint. I have a example of how
this works at the link below:
  <br>
  <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://osl.iu.edu/research/ft/ompi-cr/examples.php#uc-ckpt-stop">http://osl.iu.edu/research/ft/ompi-cr/examples.php#uc-ckpt-stop</a>
  <br>
  <br>
As far as C/R integration with schedulers/resource managers, I know
that the BLCR folks have been working with Torque to better integrate
Open MPI+BLCR+Torque. If this is of interest, you might want to check
with them on the progress of that project.

So suspend/resume of OpenMPI jobs does not require BLCR. OK so I will
proceed w/o it.<br>
<br>
