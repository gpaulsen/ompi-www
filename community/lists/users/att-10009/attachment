[n132:4855] Abort before MPI_INIT completed successfully; not able to guarantee that all other processes were killed!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
mpirun has exited due to process rank 3 with PID 4883 on
node n135x exiting without calling "finalize". This may
have caused other processes in the application to be
terminated by signals sent by mpirun (as reported here).

It looks like MPI_INIT failed for some reason; your parallel process is
likely to abort.  There are many reasons that a parallel process can
fail during MPI_INIT; some of which are due to configuration or environment
problems.  This failure appears to be an internal failure; here's some
additional information (which may only be relevant to an Open MPI
developer):

  PML add procs failed
  --&gt; Returned "Unreachable" (-12) instead of "Success" (0)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** An error occurred in MPI_Init_thread
*** before MPI was initialized
*** MPI_ERRORS_ARE_FATAL (your MPI job will now abort)
[n130:4885] Abort before MPI_INIT completed successfully; not able to guarantee that all other processes were killed!
