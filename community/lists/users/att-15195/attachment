<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" ><tr><td valign="top" style="font: inherit;"><DIV>Hi,<BR>I recently started on an MPI-based, 'real-time', pipelined-processing application, and the application fails due to large time-jitter in sending and receiving messages. Here are related info -</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>1) Platform:<BR>a) Intel Box: Two Hex-core, Intel Xeon, 2.668 GHz (...total of 12 cores), <BR>b) OS: SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 (x86_64) - Kernel \r (\l)<BR>c) MPI Rev: (OpenRTE) 1.4, (...Installed OFED package)<BR>d) HCA: InfiniBand: Mellanox Technologies MT26428 [ConnectX IB QDR, PCIe 2.0 5GT/s] (rev a0)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>2) Application detail</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>a) Launching 7 processes, for pipelined processing, where each process waits for a message (sizes vary between 1 KBytes to 26 KBytes), <BR>then process the data, and outputs a message (sizes vary between 1 KBytes to 26 KBytes), to next process.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>b) MPI transport functions used : "MPI_Isend", MPI_Irecv, MPI_Test. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; i) For Receiving messages, I first make an MPI_Irecv call, followed by a busy-loop on MPI_Test, waiting for message<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; ii) For Sending message, there is a busy-loop on MPI_Test to ensure prior buffer was sent, then use MPI_Isend.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>c) When the job starts, all these 7 process are put in High priority mode ( SCHED_FIFO policy, with priority setting of 99). <BR>The Job entails an input data packet stream (and a series of MPI messages), continually at 40 micro-sec rate, for a few minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV><BR>3) The Problem:<BR>Most calls to MPI_Test (...which is non-blocking) takes a few micro-sec, but around 10% of the job, it has a large jitter, that vary from 1 to 100 odd millisec. This causes<BR>some of the application input queues to fill-up&nbsp; and cause a failure.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Any suggestions to look at on the MPI settings or OS config/issues will be much appreciated.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Thanks in advance.<BR>Sanji</DIV></td></tr></table>
