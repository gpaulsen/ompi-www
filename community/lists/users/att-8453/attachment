Hi,<br><br>I am using the OpenMPI version 1.3 downloaded directly from the site.<br><br>I want to establish a client/server connection among two local processes (in the same machine). <br>I wrote a simple publisher combining  MPI_Open_port / MPI_Publish_name / MPI_Comm_accept and a connector with MPI_Lookup_name / MPI_Comm_connect as can be seen in attachment.<br>
An error of Invalid name argument (also in attachment) is reached in  MPI_Lookup_name, but I was execute the same test with LAM/MPI and it works well.<br><br>I did not find references to this error in OpenMPI lists.<br>Please, someone may help me with this problem?<br>
<br>Thank you in advance!<br>Márcia Cristina Cera.<br> <br>
