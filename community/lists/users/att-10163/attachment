Hi,<br>common bashrc meant if the /home is network mounted so ignore that I guess. Have you tried  adding<br> . $HOME/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-1.5.x/etc/bashrc  to your ~/.bashrc on nodes ? This will append the configurations you need from the bashrc file located inside the directory.<br>

&gt; Hi,<br>
&gt; One workaround is you can define PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH in your common<br>
&gt; .bashrc and have a resembling  paths of installation in two nodes. This<br>
&gt; works for me nicely with my three node installation :).<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
</div>Thank you very much for the advice. Actually I&#39;m running OpenFOAM (read:<br>
a program parallelized to run with Open MPI) from SLAX Live DVD, so the<br>
installation paths are identical, as well as everything else.<br>
<br>
I&#39;ve added commands that set enviromental variables in .bashrc on both<br>
nodes, but you mention &quot;common .bashrc&quot;. Common in what way? I&#39;m sorry<br>
for newbish question, again, I&#39;m supposed to be a Mechanical Engineer.<br>
:))))<br>
<br>
OpenFOAM toolkit carries a separate directory for third-party support<br>
software. In this directory there are programs for postprocessing<br>
simulation results and analyze data and Open MPI. Therefore, in my case,<br>
Open MPI is built in a separate directory and the build is automated.<br>
<br>
After the build of both programs, there is a special bashrc located in<br>
<br>
some/path/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-1.5-dev/etc/<br>
<br>
that sets all the variables needed to use Open FOAM, such as<br>
FOAM_TUTORIALS (where are the tutorials), FOAM_RUN (where is the working<br>
dir), WM_COMPILER (what compiler to use), etc. This bashrc also sets<br>
LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PATH so that locally installed Open MPI can be found.<br>
<br>
I&#39;ve tried this installation on the Live DVD on my laptop with two<br>
cores, decomposed the case and ran the simulation in parallel without a<br>
problem.<br>
<br>
I hope this information is more helpful.<br>
<br>
Best regards,<br>
