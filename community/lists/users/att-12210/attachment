<p>I believe that it specifies the *minimum* threading model supported.  If I recall, opmi is already funnel safe even in single mode.  However, if mpi calls are made from outside the main thread, you should specify funneled for portability</p>

&quot;Advice to implementors.<br>
<br>
&quot;If provided is not MPI_THREAD_SINGLE then the MPI library should not<br>
invoke C/ C++/Fortran library calls that are not thread safe, e.g., in<br>
an environment where malloc is not thread safe, then malloc should not<br>
be used by the MPI library.<br>
<br>
&quot;Some implementors may want to use different MPI libraries for different<br>
levels of thread support. They can do so using dynamic linking and<br>
selecting which library will be linked when MPI_INIT_THREAD is invoked.<br>
If this is not possible, then optimizations for lower levels of thread<br>
support will occur only when the level of thread support required is<br>
specified at link time. ( End of advice to implementors.)&quot;<br>
