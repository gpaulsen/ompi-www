                <br>
                we have deployed OpenMPI 1.4.1 and 1.4.2 on our Intel
                Nehalem cluster
                using Intel compilers V 11.1.059 and 11.1.072
                respectively, and one
                user has the following request:<br>
                <br>
                Can we build OpenMPI version say O.1 against Intel
                compilers version
                say I.1 but&nbsp; then built an application with OpenMPI O.1
                BUT then use a
                DIFFERENT Intel compiler version say I.2 to built and
                run this MPI
                application?<br>
                <br>
                I suggested to him to 1) simply try to built and run the
                application
                with O.1 but use Intel compilers version I.X whatever
                this X is and see
                if it has any issues. <br>
                <br>
                OR 2) If the above does not work, I would build OpenMPI
                O.1 against
                Intel version I.X so he can use THIS combination for his
                hypothetical
                application. <br>
                <br>
                He insists that I build OpenMPI O.1 with some version of
                Intel
                compilers I.Y but then at run time he would like to use
                <b>different</b>
                Intel run time libs at will I.Z &lt;&gt; I.X. <br>
                <br>
                Can you provide me with a suggestion for a sane solution
                to this ? <span class="moz-smiley-s1"><span> :-) </span></span><br>

      Guessing at what is meant here, if you build MPI with a given
      version
      of Intel compilers, it ought to work when the application is built
      with
      a similar or more recent Intel compiler, or when the run-time
      LD_LIBRARY_PATH refers to a similar or newer library (within
      reason).
      There are similar constraints on glibc version.&nbsp; "Within reason"
      works
      over a more restricted range when C++ is involved.&nbsp; Note that the
      Intel
      linux compilers link to the gcc and glibc libraries as well as
      those
      which come with the compiler, and the MPI could be built with a
      combination of gcc and ifort to work with icc or gcc and ifort.&nbsp;
      gfortran and ifort libraries, however, are incompatible, except
      that
      libgomp calls can be supported by libiomp5.<br>
      The "rational" use I can see is that an application programmer
      would
      likely wish to test a range of compilers without rebuilding MPI.&nbsp;
      Intel
      documentation says there is forward compatibility testing of
      libraries,
      at least to the extent that a build made with 10.1 would work with
      11.1
      libraries.<br>
      The most recent Intel library compatibility break was between MKL
      9 and
      10.<br>

    Dear Tim, I offered to provide myself the combination of OMPI+ Intel
    compilers so that application can use it in stable fashion. When I
    inquired about this application so I can look into this I was told
    that "there is NO application yet (!) that fails but just in case it
    fails ..." I was asked to hack into the OMPI&nbsp; building process to
    let OMPI use one run-time but then the MPI application using this
    OMPI ... use another! <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Thanks for the information on this. We indeed use Intel Compiler set
    11.1.XXX + OMPI 1.4.1 and 1.4.2.<br>
    <br>
    The basic motive in this hypothetical situation is to build the MPI
    application ONCE and then swap run-time libs as newer compilers come
    out.... I am certain that even if one can get away with it with
    nearby run-time versions there is no guarantee of the stability
    at-infinitum. I end up having to spent more time for technically
    "awkward" requests than the reasonable ones. Reminds me when I was a
    teacher I had to spent more time with all the people trying to avoid
    doing the work than with the good students... hmmm <span
