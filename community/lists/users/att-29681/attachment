    <p>How do you run the test ?</p>
    <p>you should have the same number of clients in each mpirun
      instance, the following simple shell starts the test as i think it
      is supposed to</p>
    <p>note the test itself is arguable since MPI_Comm_disconnect() is
      never invoked</p>
    <p>(and you will observe some related dpm_base_disconnect_init
      errors)</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>#!/bin/sh<br>
      <br>
      clients=3<br>
      <br>
          screen -d -m sh -c "mpirun -np 1 ./singleton_client_server
      $clients 1 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee /tmp/server.$clients"<br>
      for i in $(seq $clients); do</p>
    <p>    sleep 1<br>
    </p>
    <p>    screen -d -m sh -c "mpirun -np 1 ./singleton_client_server
      $clients 0 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee /tmp/client.$clients.$i"<br>
      done<br>
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>Ralph,</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>this test fails with master.</p>
    <p>when the "server" (second parameter is 1), MPI_Comm_accept()
      fails with a timeout.</p>
    <p>i ompi/dpm/dpm.c, there is a hard coded 60 seconds timeout</p>
    <p>OPAL_PMIX_EXCHANGE(rc, &amp;info, &amp;pdat, 60);</p>
    <p>but this is not the timeout that is triggered ...</p>
    <p>the eviction_cbfunc timeout function is invoked, and it has been
      set when opal_hotel_init() was invoked in
      orte/orted/pmix/pmix_server.c</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>default timeout is 2 seconds, but in this case (user invokes
      MPI_Comm_accept), i guess the timeout should be infinite or 60
      seconds (hard coded value described above)<br>
    </p>
    <p>sadly, if i set a higher timeout value (mpirun --mca
      orte_pmix_server_max_wait 180 ...), MPI_Comm_accept() does not
      return when the client invokes MPI_Comm_connect()</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>could you please have a look at this ?</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>Cheers,</p>

          <div>I have a problem with basic client - server application.
            I tried to run C program from this website <a
              moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://github.com/hpc/cce-mpi-openmpi-1.7.1/blob/master/orte/test/mpi/singleton_client_server.c"
              target="_blank"><a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://github.com/hpc/cce-mpi-openmpi-1.7.1/blob/master/orte/test/mpi/singleton_client_server.c">https://github.com/hpc/cce-mpi-openmpi-1.7.1/blob/master/orte/test/mpi/singleton_client_server.c</a></a></div>
          <div>I saw this program mentioned in many discussions in your
            website, so I expected that it should work properly, but
            after more testing I found out that there is probably an
            error somewhere in connect/accept method. I have read many
            discussions and threads on your website, but I have not
            found similar problem that I am facing. It seems that nobody
            had similar problem like me. When I run this app with one
            server and more clients (3,4,5,6,...) sometimes the app
            hangs. It hangs when second or next client wants to connect
            to the server (it depends, sometimes third client hangs,
            sometimes fourth, sometimes second, and so on). </div>
          <div>So it means that app starts to hang where server waits
            for accept and client waits for connect. And it is not
            possible to continue, because this client cannot connect to
            the server. It is strange, because I observed this behaviour
            only in some cases... Sometimes it works without any
            problems, sometimes it does not work. The behaviour is
            unpredictable and not stable.</div>
          <div><br>
          </div>
          <div>I have installed openmpi 1.10.2 on my Fedora 19. I have
            the same problem with Java alternative of this application.
            It hangs also sometimes... I need this app in Java, but
            firstly it must work properly in C implementation. Because
            of this strange behaviour I assume that there can be an
            error maybe inside of openmpi implementation of
            connect/accept methods. I tried it also with another version
            of openmpi - 1.8.1. However, the problem did not disappear.</div>
          <div><br>
          </div>
          <div>Could you help me, what can cause the problem? Maybe I
            did not get something about openmpi (or connect/server) and
            the problem is with me... I will appreciate any your help,
            support, or interest about this topic.</div>
