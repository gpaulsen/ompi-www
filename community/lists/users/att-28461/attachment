<div>Perhaps we should improve the error reporting at run time to display something about the fact that you used a fortran data type but have an OMPI that was compiled without fortran support. <br>

&gt; BTW: is there a reason you don&#39;t want to just use the C datatypes?  The fundamental output of the index is an integer value -- casting it to a float of some flavor doesn&#39;t fundamentally change its value.

<div>The code in question is not mine.  I have suggested to the developers that they should use the correct C types.  The reason I became aware of this issue is that one of my colleagues compiled and ran this code on a system where OpenMPI was built without
 Fortran support and the code started failing with errors from MPI which were not seen on other systems.</div>

<div>If you use an MPI library compiled without Fortran support, you should expect precisely nothing related to Fortran to work.  You might get more than this because the universe is being nice to you, but you should treat it as serendipity when something works,
 not a bug when something doesn&#39;t.</div>
