<div dir="ltr">Hi,<br><br>Basically, my course is about Open source code development, where students join existing open source projects and add code to it (much like in Google summer of code). As a grad student with a thesis involving Open-MPI, I know there is much to learn from is as a case study, and so I plan to spend most of the time (the entire lecture is about 2 hours) on technical aspects of the Open-MPI project (e.g. the layered structure, the MCA, etc.).<br>
With that said, I would also like to talk a little about the project from another point of view: How did the project form, who is the development community, how new code is contributed to the code-base (who writes it and who reviews it), and how does one join the project.<br>
I&#39;m not sure there is any material about the latter, but I&#39;d appreciate it if someone could help me find some material to begin with towards the lecture.<br><br>By the way, I&#39;ve been looking for good MPI(2) advanced programming material (including advanced use of collective operations) for another course I was TAing (distributed computing applications). I ended up writing some by myself, but if there are some - that would be great.<br>
<br>Thanks,<br>Alex <br><br><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Fri, Apr 24, 2009 at 11:04 PM, Jeff Squyres <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:jsquyres@cisco.com">jsquyres@cisco.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;">

I&#39;m a grad student, working on a MPI communication optimization, and I&#39;ve been working with Open-MPI for quite a while now. I&#39;m also a TA in a course about open-source development, and I would like to present Open-MPI as a case study. In particular, I thought about something along the lines of the developer workshop, only fitted in 2 hours time. I was hoping there is some editable material (possibly, copies of presentations) available. Can you point me in the right direction?<br>

We have a fairly old set of slides from an Open MPI&#39;s developer&#39;s workshop about 3 years ago (when many organizations came on board with Open MPI).  Much of that stuff is likely out of date, but some of the lower level / glue stuff is likely at least partially relevant (read: not totally out of date).<br>

<br>
What kinds of things are you looking to present?  Technical / programming details about the internal guts of Open MPI itself, or more of an MPI tutorial (e.g., how to write MPI programs)?<br><font color="#888888">
