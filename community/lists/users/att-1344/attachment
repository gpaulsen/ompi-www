Starting from scratch is probably easiest.&nbsp; If you installed Open MPI to 
its own directory, just remove the installation directory.&nbsp; If you 
installed Open MPI to a directory that contains other things, a "make uninstall" 
in your original Open MPI source tree should completely uninstall it 
properly.</FONT></SPAN></DIV>

What specific version of Open MPI are you using?&nbsp; We just fixed a shared 
memory threaded issue -- I'm afraid I didn't follow this thread closely enough 
to&nbsp;remember if you updated before or after that fix.</FONT></SPAN></DIV>

<DIV><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff size=2><SPAN class=194423213-01062006>3. Are 
you saying that your processes would not die if you killed them with 
SIGINT?&nbsp; This would be extremely strange.</SPAN></FONT></DIV>

Note that there are issues with signals and threads on Linux -- IIRC, you can't 
necessarily guarantee which thread will catch which signal.&nbsp; It depends on 
what you are doing with your SIGALRM processing -- how are you shutting down 
MPI?&nbsp; Are you terminating all MPI actions in threads before calling 
MPI_FINALIZE?</SPAN></FONT></DIV>

Open MPI does not have an equivalent of lamclean or lamwipe at this time.&nbsp; 
Sorry!</SPAN></FONT></DIV>

  THREAD_MULTIPLE option. I am registering a function to catch SIGALRM signal in

  normally. This is also as the same problem as the previous one, sometimes
