It seems that a very old bug (<a href="http://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/ticket/1982">svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/ticket/1982</a>) is playing up when linking fortran code with mpicc on Mac OS X 10.6 and the Macports distribution openmpi @1.6.3_0+gcc44. I got it working by reading up on this discussion thread:<br>
<a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/users/2011/11/17862.php">http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/users/2011/11/17862.php</a><br>and applying the fix given there, add &#39;-Wl,-commons,use_dylibs&#39;, to the c compiler flags solves the problem. <br>
<br>In addition to that discussion should be mentioned that it is in fact a link flag, not a compiler issue, so the important thing is to supply the flag to the linker, not the fortran compiler. The fix would be to add -Wl,-commons,use_dylibs to the flags supplied by mpicc, but I guess that there could be reasons for not doing that, but that is for you experts to say.<br>
<br>I&#39;m posting to the users&#39; list, because I&#39;m unsure of whether this qualifies as a bug propre, but at least it falls 
in the category &quot;undocumented behaviour that totally baffled a fairly 
experienced user used to solving his own problems and who is generally 
not a whiner&quot;. <br><br>Cheers,<br>Torbjörn<br clear="all"><br>-- <br>======================================<br>Torbjörn Björkman
