<p>SUBMISSION      DEADLINE:
<br>
Abstracts:      March 12, 2009
<br>
Full Paper:     June 8, 2009
<br>
<p><p>Scope:
<br>
<p>Virtualization has  become a common  abstraction layer in  modern data
<br>
centers,  enabling resource  owners to  manage  complex infrastructure
<br>
independently  of their  applications.   Conjointly virtualization  is
<br>
becoming  a driving  technology for  a manifold  of industry  grade IT
<br>
services. Piloted by the  Amazon Elastic Computing Cloud services, the
<br>
cloud  concept includes the  notion of  a separation  between resource
<br>
owners  and   users,  adding  services  such   as  hosted  application
<br>
frameworks  and  queuing. Utilizing  the  same infrastructure,  clouds
<br>
carry  significant potential  for use  in  high-performance scientific
<br>
computing. The ability of clouds  to provide for requests and releases
<br>
of vast computing resource dynamically  and close to the marginal cost
<br>
of  providing  the  services   is  unprecedented  in  the  history  of
<br>
scientific and commercial computing.
<br>
<p>Distributed computing concepts that leverage federated resource access
<br>
are popular  within the grid  community, but have not  seen previously
<br>
desired  deployed  levels  so  far.   Also,  many  of  the  scientific
<br>
datacenters have not adopted virtualization or cloud concepts yet.
<br>
<p>This  workshop aims to  bring together  industrial providers  with the
<br>
scientific community in order  to foster discussion, collaboration and
<br>
mutual exchange of knowledge and experience.
<br>
<p>The  workshop will  be one  day in  length, composed  of 20  min paper
<br>
presentations,   each  followed   by  10   min   discussion  sections.
<br>
Presentations  may be  accompanied by  interactive  demonstrations. It
<br>
concludes with a 30 min panel discussion by presenters.
<br>

<p><p>PAPER SUBMISSION
<br>
<p>Papers  submitted to the  workshop will  be reviewed  by at  least two
<br>
members of  the program committee and  external reviewers. Submissions
<br>
should  include  abstract,  key  words,  the  e-mail  address  of  the
<br>
corresponding author,  and must not exceed 10  pages, including tables
<br>
and figures at  a main font size no smaller  than 11 point. Submission
<br>
of a paper  should be regarded as a commitment  that, should the paper
<br>
be accepted, at least one of  the authors will register and attend the
<br>
conference to present the work.
<br>
<p>Accepted papers  will be published in  the Springer LNCS  series - the
<br>
format  must  be  according   to  the  Springer  LNCS  Style.  Initial
<br>
submissions are in PDF, accepted  papers will be requested to provided
<br>
source files.
