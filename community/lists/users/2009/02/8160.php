Hi!
<br>
<p><span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; PS: It is not obvious on the OpenMPI web site where to report bugs. When
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; clicking on &quot;Bug Tracking&quot;, which seems most obvious, I'm redirected to
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the Trac Timeline, and there is no place where I can report bugs or
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; anything.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; Bummer; I had thought the Big Red Links for &quot;Getting Help/Support&quot; were 
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; obvious.  :-(
</span><br>
<p>Well, if I come to a site to report a bug, I am not exactly looking for 
<br>
help or support, am I? in particular, if there is a link &quot;Bug tracking&quot;, 
<br>
it seems more obvious to me to follow that link.
<br>
Well, I guess this is a minor issue, and maybe everybody who clicks &quot;Bug 
<br>
Tracking&quot; will sooner or later also click on &quot;Getting Help/Support&quot;...
<br>
<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt; Indeed, the very first line of text on the 
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/community/help/">http://www.open-mpi.org/community/help/</a> page says:
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;If you have a bug report and/or patch for Open MPI, you should probably 
</span><br>
[clip]
<br>
<p>Yes, this explains it - as soon as you have got to that page.
<br>
<p>I think that a simple solution would be to put a link onto the Trac 
<br>
Timeline page that says something like: &quot;To report bugs, please refer to 
<br>
the mailing list. This tracker is mostly for the OpenMPI developers.&quot; or 
<br>
something like that. But I believe that this might not be as simple as 
<br>
it sounds in Trac.
<br>
<p>Olaf
