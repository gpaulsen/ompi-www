<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm having problems understanding your base argument here. It seems 
<br>
to be that you are afraid that Boost.MPI will make your prototype 
<br>
program so much better and easier to write that you won't want to remove 
<br>
it. Wouldn't this be exactly the reason why keeping it would be good?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like and use Boost.MPI. I voted for inclusion during the review in 
<br>
the Boost developer community. However, what you should do in your 
<br>
program is use those tools that produce the right trade off between the 
<br>
best performance, easiest to develop correctly, and most maintainable 
<br>
program you can. If that means using Boost.MPI, then remember that 
<br>
questions about it are answered at the Boost Users mailing list. If your 
<br>
decision is that that does not include Boost.MPI then you will have some 
<br>
other challenges to face but experience shows that you can still produce 
<br>
a very high quality program.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose as you see fit, just be sure to understand your own reasons. 
<br>
(Whether any of the rest of us on this list understand them or not.)
