<p><p>I should add that I fully understand what it is you are saying and despite all

the good things there were being said about Boost, I was avoiding it for a very

long time because of the dependency issue.  For two reasons -- the dependency 
<br>
issue for myself (exactly like what you said) and distributing it means users

will have to do an extra step (regardless of how easy/hard the step is, it's an 
<br>
extra step).
<br>
<p>I finally switched over :-) and the &quot;prototype&quot; idea was just a way to ease you 
<br>
into it.  MPI programs are hard to get right, and Boost aside, it is a good idea 
<br>
to have something working that is easy to do and then you can remove the parts 
<br>
that you don't like later.
<br>
<p>By the way, it seems that less-used parts of MPI do not have equivalents in 
<br>
Boost.MPI, so just using Boost won't solve all of your problems.  There is a 
<br>
list here (the table with the entries that say &quot;unsupported&quot;):

<br>
<p>Good luck!
