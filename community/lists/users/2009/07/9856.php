<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess we view it differently. Boost.MPI isn't a language at all. It 
<br>
is a library written in fully ISO compliant C++, that exists to make 
<br>
doing an otherwise complex and error prone job simpler and more 
<br>
readable. As such, I would compare it to using a well tested BLAS 
<br>
library to do matrix manipulations in your Fortran code or writing it 
<br>
yourself. Both can be standard conforming Fortran (though many BLAS 
<br>
implementations include lower level optimized code), and neither is a 
<br>
flavor of the month interpreted language. The advantage of the library 
<br>
is that it allows you to work at a level of abstraction that may be 
<br>
better suited to your work.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For you, as for everyone else, make your choices based on what you 
<br>
believe best serves the needs of your program, whether that includes 
<br>
Boost.MPI or not. However, making the choices with an understanding of 
<br>
the options strengths and weaknesses gives the best chance of writing a 
<br>
good program.

<p>PS - I am not part of the MPI Forum, but I would be surprised if they 
<br>
chose to add boost to any MPI version. Possibly an analog of Boost.MPI, 
<br>
but not all of boost. There are over 100 different libraries, covering 
<br>
many different areas of use in boost, and most of them have no direct 
<br>
connection to MPI.
<br>
<p>PPS - If anyone would like to know more about Boost, I would suggest the 
<br>
website (<a href="http://www.boost.org">http://www.boost.org</a>) or the user mailing list. Folks who don't 
<br>
write in C++ will probably not be very interested.
