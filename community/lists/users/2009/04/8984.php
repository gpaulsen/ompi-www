<p>When you download Open MPI software, I guess there is an examples 
<br>
subdirectory.  Maybe the example codes there would suffice to illustrate 
<br>
message passing to someone who is not familiar with it.
<br>
<p>HPL (and the HPC Challenge test suite, which includes HPL) may involve a 
<br>
little bit of wrestling, but you're probably best off there wading 
<br>
through their README files, including following their advice about what 
<br>
to do if you encounter problems.
