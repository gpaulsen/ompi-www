Thank You Eugene Loh,
It is very important for me to explain the spike at figure!
But I dont know how to hunt the reason and how to check it.
Would you please help me in more practically?


Thank you again.

Right.  So, baseline performance seems reasonable, but there is an odd
spike that seems difficult to explain.  This is annoying, but again: 
how important is it to resolve that mystery?  You can spend a few days
trying to hunt this down, only to find that it's some oddity that has
no general relevence.  I don't know if that's really the case, but I'm
just suggesting that it may make most sense just to let this one go.

But, exactly the same program gets different result in another
cluster.
I mean the result doent have any spike at all.
Second cluster is almost the same features with the previous one

So, the remaining mystery is the 6x or so spike at 128 Mbyte.  Dunno. 
How important is it to resolve that mystery?
