Hi,
<br>
<p>Basically, my course is about Open source code development, where students
<br>
join existing open source projects and add code to it (much like in Google
<br>
summer of code). As a grad student with a thesis involving Open-MPI, I know
<br>
there is much to learn from is as a case study, and so I plan to spend most
<br>
of the time (the entire lecture is about 2 hours) on technical aspects of
<br>
the Open-MPI project (e.g. the layered structure, the MCA, etc.).
<br>
With that said, I would also like to talk a little about the project from
<br>
another point of view: How did the project form, who is the development
<br>
community, how new code is contributed to the code-base (who writes it and
<br>
who reviews it), and how does one join the project.
<br>
I'm not sure there is any material about the latter, but I'd appreciate it
<br>
if someone could help me find some material to begin with towards the
<br>
lecture.
<br>
<p>By the way, I've been looking for good MPI(2) advanced programming material
<br>
(including advanced use of collective operations) for another course I was
<br>
TAing (distributed computing applications). I ended up writing some by
<br>
myself, but if there are some - that would be great.
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Alex
