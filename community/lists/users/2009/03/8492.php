Hi Ron,

<p><p>Opps!  My turn to apologize -- I have to admit that I read through your post very quickly and skipped the sentence about the lack of a firewall.  However, everything else sounded exactly like what I was getting.
<br>
<p>Actually, it would be good to find out what the problem with the firewall is and to not simply turn it off.  As I'm not the sysadmin, I can't really play with the settings to find out.
<br>
<p>In your message (which I will now read more carefully :-) ), it says that you are using CentOS, which is based on RH.  Our systems are using Fedora.  Perhaps it has something to do with RH's defaults for the firewall settings?  Another system that worked &quot;immediately&quot; was a Debian system.  Anyway, if you find out a solution that doesn't require the firewall to be turned off, please let me know -- I think our sysadmin would be interested, too.
