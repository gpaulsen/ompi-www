<div class="gmail_quote"><div class="gmail_quote">Hello fellows, <br><div class="im"><br>I'm search the best Message Passing implementation to use in the University Beowulf Cluster, and I was wandering if&nbsp; MPI can determine which CPU to send a process.<br>With MPI I can determine the host and the number of process, and with&nbsp; -npernode , the number of process per nodes, but that guaranty that if I put 4 quad cores in some host list, and use -npernode 3, it will execute exactly 1 process per CPU in which&nbsp; host? <br></div>And I can determine the CPU to send a process, like CPU1 or CPU0 , some CPU affinity on execution time?<br><br>Best Regards.<br><br>Otavio Augusto.<br>
