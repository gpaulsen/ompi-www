<div style="text-align: left;">Dear all,<br><br>Myself quite new to Open MPI. Recently, I had installed openmpi-1.3.3 separately on two of my machines ict1 and ict2. These machines are dual-socket quad-core (Intel Xeon E5410) i.e. each having 8 processors and are connected by Gigabit ethernet switch. As a prerequisite, I can ssh between them without a password or passphrase ( I did not supply the passphrase at all ). Thereafter,<br>
<br>$ cd openmpi-1.3.3<br>$ mkdir build<br>$ cd build<br>$ ../configure --prefix=/usr/local/openmpi-1.3.3/<br><br>Then as a root user,<br><br># make all install <br><br>Also .bash_profile and .bashrc had the following lines written into them:<br>
<br>PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/openmpi-1.3.3/bin/<br>LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/openmpi-1.3.3/lib/<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br><br>$ cd ../examples/<br>$ make<br>$ mpirun -np 2 --host ict1 hello_c<br>   hello_c: error while loading shared libraries: libmpi.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No suchfile or directory<br>   hello_c: error while loading shared libraries: libmpi.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No suchfile or directory<br>
<br>$ mpirun --prefix /usr/local/openmpi-1.3.3/ -np 2 --host ict1 hello_c<br>   Hello, world, I am 1 of 2<br>   Hello, world, I am 0 of 2<br><br>But the program hangs when ....<br><br>$ mpirun --prefix /usr/local/openmpi-1.3.3/ -np 2 --host ict1,ict2 hello_c<br>
 <br>This statement does not produce any output. Doing top on either machines does not show any hello_c running. However, when I press Ctrl+C the following output appears<br><br>^Cmpirun: killing job...<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
mpirun noticed that the job aborted, but has no info as to the process<br>that caused that situation.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
mpirun was unable to cleanly terminate the daemons on the nodes shown<br>below. Additional manual cleanup may be required - please refer to<br>the &quot;orte-clean&quot; tool for assistance.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
        ict2 - daemon did not report back when launched<br><br>$<br><br>The same thing repeats itself when hello_c is run from ict2. Since, the program does not produce any error, it becomes difficult to locate where I might have gone wrong. <br>
<br>Did anyone of you encounter this problem or anything similar ? <font><font size="2">Any help would be much appreciated.<br><br>Thanks,</font></font><br><br></div>-- <br><br>Souvik<br><br>
