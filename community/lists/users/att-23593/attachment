<div dir="ltr">Hello,<div><br></div><div>I am running a MPI application on a single host, with a dual quadcore with hyperthreading on. (16 OS-visible processors), but just in debug mode (msvc2010) 32bit, with 2 mpi processes only.</div>

<div><br></div><div>mpirun -mca btl_tcp_if_exclude lo -np 1 prog1.exe : -np 1 prog2.exe<br></div><div><br></div><div>. when progr1.exe has 1 thread (mpi never initialized), everything works fine.</div><div>. when progr2.exe has 2 threads (1 thread with no call to mpi functions, and a second thread where mpi is initialized, through a default ctor of boost::mpi::environment, I think thos means just a call to MPI_Initialize() ), ompi_info gives &quot;Threading support: No&quot;</div>

<div><br></div><div>1.

<div><br></div><div>In fact, it appears at a certain point during a boost::mpi::broadcast, within threadMPI, boost::mpi calls MPI_Isend (point_to_point.cpp: 53), during this Isend, a 3rd thread (not threadMPI) is created and causes a call to f() which doesn&#39;t see X as !=nullptr.<br>

</div><div><br></div><div>I can see this while debugging with msvc, and stepping into MPI_Isend (i don&#39;t have the sources for it). At that moment, suddenly a new thread is created, and a call to f() is made.</div><div>

<br></div><div>This all sounds quite nightmarish.</div><div><br></div><div>I understand I haven&#39;t presented any specific code to receive an accurate answer, but any help is appreciated.</div><div><br></div><div>Regards,</div>
