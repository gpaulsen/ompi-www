<div>Hi,</div>  <div>I some times get this error message.</div>  <div>" 2 addtional processes aborted, possibly by openMPI"</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Some times 2 processes, sometimes even more. Is it due to over load or program error?</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Why does openMPI actually abort few processes?</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Can anyone explain?</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Imran</div><p>&#32;__________________________________________________<br>Do You Yahoo!?<br>Tired of spam?
