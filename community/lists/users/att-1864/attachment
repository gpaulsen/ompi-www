Hi&nbsp; Renato,<br>  thanks for your response.<br>  Can you elaborate on this.? <br>  I have few doubts as well:<br>  1) OpenMPI runtime supports SGE?? Does it uses SGE instead of MPI runtime when it finds SGE running??<br>  2) Is it possible to check point and run MPI jobs?<br>  3) Is it possible to add and remove processes dynamically from the MPI communicator?<br>  5) When do we actually need many different communicators?<br>  4) Is MPI only suitable for low latency communication in&nbsp; a cluster environment?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br><br><b><i>Ralph H Castain &lt;rhc@lanl.gov&gt;</i></b> wrote:<blockquote class="replbq" style="border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255); margin-left: 5px; padding-left: 5px;">  I can't speak to the Perl bindings, but Open MPI's runtime already supports<br>SGE, so all you have to do is "mpirun" like usual and we take care of the<br>rest. You may have to check your version of Open MPI as this capability was<br>added in the more recent
 releases.<br><br>Ralph<br><br><br>On 9/13/06 8:52 AM, "Renato Golin" <rengolin @gmail.com=""> wrote:<br><br>&gt; On 9/13/06, imran shaik <sk.imran @yahoo.com=""> wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;  I need to run parallel jobs on a cluster typically of size 600 nodes and<br>&gt;&gt; running SGE, but the programmers are good at perl but not C or C++.

If your<br>&gt; problem is easily splittable (like parse a large apache log, read a<br>&gt; large xml list of things) you might be able to split the data and<br>&gt; spawn as many process as you can.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; I do it using LSF (another dispatcher) and a Makefile that controls<br>&gt; the dependencies and spawn the processes (using make's -j flag) and it<br>&gt; works quite well. But if
 your job need the communication (like<br>&gt; processing big matrices, collecting and distributing data among<br>&gt; processes etc) you'll need an interprocess communication and that's<br>&gt; what MPI is best at.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; In a nutshell, you'll need the runtime environment to run MPI programs<br>&gt; as well as you need SGE's runtime environments on every node to<br>&gt; dispatch jobs and collect information.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; About MPI bindings for Perl, there's this module:<br>&gt; http://search.cpan.org/~josh/Parallel-MPI-0.03/MPI.pm<br>&gt; <br>&gt; but it's far too young to be trustworthy, IMHO, and you'll probably<br>&gt; need the MPI runtime on all nodes as well...<br>&gt; <br>&gt; cheers,<br>&gt; --renato<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; users mailing list<br>&gt; users@open-mpi.org<br>&gt; http://www.open-mpi.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/users<br><br><br>_______________________________________________<br>users mailing
