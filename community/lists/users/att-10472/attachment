<p>As far as I can see, Jeff's analysis is dead on.  The matching order at P2 is based on the order in which the envelopes from P0 and P1 <b>show up</b> at P2.  The Barrier does not force an order between the communication paths P0-&gt;P2 vs. P1-&gt;P2.<br>
<br>
The MPI standard does not even say what &quot;show up&quot; means unless there is a single source.  Say P0-&gt;P2 and P1-&gt;P2 are different kinds of links and the MPI progress engine services link types round robin.<br>
<br>
The standard does say that if there are 2 sends from p0 to p2 and two receives at P2 that could match either send, the matching order at P2 must be the same as the issue order.at P0. <br>

&gt; &gt; E.g., let's say P0 and P1 each send a message to P2, both using the &nbsp;<br>
&gt; &gt; same tag and communicator. &nbsp;Let's say P2 does two receives on that &nbsp;<br>
&gt; &gt; communicator and tag, using a wildcard source. &nbsp;So, the messages &nbsp;<br>
&gt; &gt; could be received in either order. &nbsp;One could introduce barriers to &nbsp;<br>
&gt; &gt; order the messages. &nbsp;E.g.,<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; P0:<br>
&gt; &gt; &nbsp; Send<br>
&gt; &gt; &nbsp; Barrier<br>
&gt; &gt; P1:<br>
&gt; &gt; &nbsp; Barrier<br>
&gt; &gt; &nbsp; Send<br>
&gt; &gt; P2:<br>
&gt; &gt; &nbsp; Recv<br>
&gt; &gt; &nbsp; Barrier<br>
&gt; &gt; &nbsp; Recv<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Is this behavior *guaranteed* by MPI? &nbsp;I'm not actually sure that it &nbsp;<br>
&gt; is; barrier does not provide any guarantees about point-to-point &nbsp;<br>
&gt; message passing progress.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; For example, how about a machine with these assumptions:<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; - P0 is &quot;far away&quot; from P2 on the point-to-point network<br>
&gt; - P1 is &quot;close by&quot; to P2 on the point-to-point network<br>
&gt; - Barriers go across a separate/fast network (think: bluegene)<br>
&gt; - P0's send message is short/eager<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; In this case, the Send from P0 complete &quot;immediately&quot; and enter the &nbsp;<br>
&gt; barrier before it is delivered to P2. &nbsp;The P0 send could then take a &nbsp;<br>
&gt; &quot;long time&quot; to get to P2 -- potentially long enough for the barrier to &nbsp;<br>
&gt; overtake it and for the Send from P1 to be delivered to P2 before the &nbsp;<br>
&gt; Send from P0 arrives at P2.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Couldn't that happen?<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Granted, I would expect that your example would perform in most real- <br>
&gt; world situations as you describe (P0 is delivered to P2, then P1 is &nbsp;<br>
&gt; delivered to P2). &nbsp;But I don't think the standard guarantees it.<br>
