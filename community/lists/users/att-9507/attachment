Thanks for your answer.<br>
Yes.<br>

"make all install"?<br>

No, but now that I have done it, the result is the same: "ld: attempted
static link of dynamic object
`../../../opal/.libs/libopen-pal.so'

Also, I note that your prefix looks really strange - it looks like you
are trying to install OMPI where the Intel compiler is located? Are you

</blockquote>
Well yes, but maybe it is a silly thing. I wanted to do that because of

$PATH $LD_LIBRARY_PATH and so on. Furthermore, I would like to keep a
version compiled with gcc and gfortran in /usr/local.<br>
