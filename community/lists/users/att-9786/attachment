Hi all,<br><br>I got the solution but its not flexible. I have to provide two host files &quot;chfile&quot; and &quot;dhfile&quot;. Contents of host files are as follows<br><br>$ cat chfile<br>#This file contains all slaves as well as master node<br>
localhost<br>200.40.70.193<br><br>$cat dhfile<br>#This file contains all slave nodes<br>200.40.70.193<br><br>and the command line I am using is <br><br>$ mpirun -np 1 -hostfile chfile launcher -hostfile dhfile<br><br>but this is not what I want.<br>
   I don&#39;t know in advance which and how many remote nodes can be there.
Dynamically nodes may be added and requested to serve the master. So I
am assuming that I have only local machine where I will invoke launcher
program. When one remote node gets added launcher program will launch
one &quot;slave&quot; in local machine and one &quot;rslave&quot; in remote machine.<br><br>Is there any other way to do this.<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>Regards,<br>  <br><div class="gmail_quote">On Mon, Jun 29, 2009 at 10:49 AM, vipin kumar <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:vipinkumar41@gmail.com">vipinkumar41@gmail.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br>
