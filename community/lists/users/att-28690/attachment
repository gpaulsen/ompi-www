Hopefully the community here will help me out.<br><br></div>I know that Infiniband is a &#39;standard&#39; interface (standardized by IETF? IEEE? or some similar body), much like Ethernet.<br><br></div>However, I do see that they come in different &#39;flavors&#39;, (and have different feature set?) such as Qlogic PSM or Mellanox ConnectX, that have *user space* &quot;drivers&quot; and even OpenMPI treats them differently (preferring Qlogic PSM over other IB, as a default behavior).<br><br></div>For someone very new to the Infiniband world, what are the differences? How can they be different and yet confirm to the (supposed) standard?<br><br></div>Any pointer to appropriate literature is appreciated.<br><br></div>Thanks in advance<br></div>Durga<br><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><br clear="all"><div><div class="gmail_signature">Life is complex.
