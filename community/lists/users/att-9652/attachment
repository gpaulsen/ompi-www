I believe you will find a fairly complete discussion of firewall issues with MPI on the OMPI mailing lists. Bottom line is that the firewall blocks both the ssh port plus the TCP communication ports required to wireup the MPI transports. If you are using the TCP transport, then those ports are also blocked.<div>
<br></div><div>You can open specific ports in your firewall, and telling OMPI to use those ports for both wireup and MPI transport. We don&#39;t necessarily recommend it, though, as it leaves a security hole in your firewall.</div>

Parallel jobs involving the host and nodes launched from a node were successful while those launched on the host were apparently blocked by the firewall. Would the former only involve the use of the ssh port on the host while the latter involve other ports?<br>
