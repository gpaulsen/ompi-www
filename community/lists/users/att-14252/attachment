Hi,<br><br>Sorry, but i get lost in what i wanna do, i have build a small home cluster with Pelican_HPC, that user openMPI, and i was trying to find a way to get a multithreaded program work in a multiprocess way without taking the time to learn MPI. And my vision was a sort of wrapper that take C posix app src code, and convert it from pthread to a multiprocessMPI app. But the problem is the remote memory access, that will only be implemented in MPI 3.0(for what i&#39;ve read of it).<br>
<br>So, after 12 hour of intensive reading about MPI and POSIX, the best way to deal with my problem(running a C pthreaded app in my cluster) is to convert the src in a SPMD way.<br>I didn&#39;t mentionned that basicly, my prog open huge text file, take each string and process it through lot&#39;s of cryptographic iteration and then save the result in an output.out like file.<br>
So i will need to make the master process split the input file and then send them as input for the worker process.<br><br>But if you or someone else know a kind of interpretor like program to run a multithreaded C program and convert it logically to a master/worker multiprocess MPI that will be sended by ssh to the interpreter on the worker side and then lunched.<br>
<br>This is what i&#39;ve tried to explain in the last msg. A dream for the hobyist that want to get the full power of a night-time cluster, without having to learn all the MPI syntax and structure.<br><br>If it doesn&#39;t exist, this would be a really great tool i think.<br>
<br>Thank you for your reply, but i think i have answered my question alone... No Pain, No Gain...<br><div class="gmail_quote"><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); padding-left: 1ex;">

&gt; I wanna know if it exist a implementation that permit to run a single host process on the master of the cluster, that will then spawn 1 process per -np X defined thread at the host specified in the host list. The host will then act as a syncronized sender/collecter of the work done.<br>

I don&#39;t fully understand you explanation either but I may be able to help clear up what you are asking for:<br>
<br>
If you mean &quot;pthreads&quot; or &quot;linux threads&quot; then no, you cannot have different threads on different nodes under any programming paradigm.<br>
<br>
However if you mean &quot;execution threads&quot; or in MPI parlance &quot;ranks&quot; then yes, under OpenMPI each &quot;rank&quot; will be a separate process on one of the nodes in the host list, as Jody says look at MPI_Comm_Spawn for this.<br>
