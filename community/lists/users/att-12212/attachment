I don't know (I'm a little new to this area), but I figured out how to get around the problem:<br><br>Using SGE and MVAPICH2, the "-env MV2_CPU_MAPPING 0:1....." option in mpiexec seems to do the trick.<br>
<br>
So when calling the external program with mpiexec, I map the called
process to the current core rank, and it seems to stay distributed and
separated as I want.<br><br>Hope someone else finds this useful in the future.<br><br>&gt; Date: Wed, 3 Mar 2010 13:13:01 +1100<br>&gt; Subject: Re: [OMPI users] running external program on same	processor	(Fortran)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Surely this is the problem of the scheduler that your system uses,<br>&gt; rather than MPI?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; On Wed, 2010-03-03 at 00:48 +0000, abc def wrote:<br>&gt; &gt; Hello,<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; I wonder if someone can help.<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; The situation is that I have an MPI-parallel fortran program. I run it<br>&gt; &gt; and it's distributed on N cores, and each of these processes must call<br>&gt; &gt; an external program.<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; This external program is also an MPI program, however I want to run it<br>&gt; &gt; in serial, on the core that is calling it, as if it were part of the<br>&gt; &gt; fortran program. The fortran program waits until the external program<br>&gt; &gt; has completed, and then continues.<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; The problem is that this external program seems to run on any core,<br>&gt; &gt; and not necessarily the (now idle) core that called it. This slows<br>&gt; &gt; things down a lot as you get one core doing multiple tasks.<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; Can anyone tell me how I can call the program and ensure it runs only<br>&gt; &gt; on the core that's calling it? Note that there are several cores per<br>&gt; &gt; node. I can ID the node by running the hostname command (I don't know<br>&gt; &gt; a way to do this for individual cores).<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; Thanks!<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; ====<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; Extra information that might be helpful:<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; If I simply run the external program from the command line (ie, type<br>&gt; &gt; "/path/myprogram.ex &lt;enter&gt;"), it runs fine. If I run it within the<br>&gt; &gt; fortran program by calling it via<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; CALL SYSTEM("/path/myprogram.ex")<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; it doesn't run at all (doesn't even start) and everything crashes. I<br>&gt; &gt; don't know why this is.<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; If I call it using mpiexec:<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; CALL SYSTEM("mpiexec -n 1 /path/myprogram.ex")<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; then it does work, but I get the problem that it can go on any core. <br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; ______________________________________________________________________<br>&gt; &gt; Do you want a Hotmail account?
