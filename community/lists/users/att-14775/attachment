So to clarify, the current -binding &lt;binding_strategy&gt;:&lt;binding_amount&gt; allocates binding_amount cores to each sge_shepherd process associated with a job_id.  There appears to be only one sge_shepherd process per job_id per execution node, so all child processes run on these allocated cores.  This is irrespective of the number of slots allocated to the node.

    I believe the above is correct.<br>

I agree with Reuti that the binding_amount parameter should be a maximum number of bound cores per node, with the actual number determined by the number of slots allocated per node.  FWIW, an alternative approach might be to have another binding_type ('slot', say) that automatically allocated one core per slot.

    That might be correct, I've put in a question to someone who should
    know.<br>

Of course, a complex situation might arise if a user submits a combined MPI/multithreaded job, but then I guess we're into the realm of setting allocation_rule.

    Yes, that would get ugly.<br>

Is it going to be worth looking at creating a patch for this?  I don't know much of the internals of SGE -- would it be hard work to do?  I've not that much time to dedicate towards it, but I could put some effort in if necessary...

    Is the patch you're wanting is for a "slot" binding_type?<br>
