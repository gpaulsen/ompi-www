<br>Sir,<br><br>I was following your discussion. <br><br>Brice Sir&#39;s explanation of what I want is correct. <br><br>Your last reply was asking me to look for ompi_proc_t for the process in the proc_flafs field if I am correct. You said that the defintion of the values will be in opal/mca/hwloc/hwloc.h. I checked in this file in OpenMPI 1.6. I couldn&#39;t find it. Is it available in the later versions of OpenMPI. <br>
<br><br>Thank You<br><br>The locality of every process is stored on the ompi_proc_t for that process in the proc_flags field. You can find the definition of the values in opal/mca/hwloc/hwloc.h. <br><div class="gmail_quote">
