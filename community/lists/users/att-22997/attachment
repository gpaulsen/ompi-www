<div dir="ltr">Hi,<div><br></div><div>I&#39;m currently trying to get the included java bindings running but as I&#39;ve mentioned in a previous post I&#39;ve had some problems. </div><div><br></div><div>./configure --prefix=/opt/openmpi-1.9-java --without-openib --enable-static --with-threads=posix --enable-mpi-thread-multiple --enable-mpi-java --with-jdk-bindir=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-armhf/bin --with-jdk-headers=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-armhf/include<br>

</div><div><br></div><div>The configure succeeds without any errors, but the build breaks in ompi/mpi/java/c since the compiler doesn&#39;t include the jdk-headers. I fixed the corresponding Makefile to include it and it works.</div>

<div><br></div><div>The second error I get is in ompi/tools/wrappers/Makefile where it sets: </div><div><div>am__append_1 = mpijavac.1</div><div>am__append_2 = mpijavac.1</div></div><div><br></div><div>shouldn&#39;t this be <a href="http://mpijavac.pl">mpijavac.pl</a> instead?</div>

<div><br></div><div>I changed it to .pl and it seems to build with any more errors, &quot;mpirun java&quot; works fine for some simple Java tests.</div><div><br></div><div>After this I tried some other tests using the MPI.OBJECT datatype, just to discover that it wasn&#39;t supported. I saw that it was included in mpiJava 1.2 and the current mpiJava in OMPI is 1.1(?). I guess the java bindings aren&#39;t that prioritized?</div>

<div><br></div><div>Do you have any advice for me to do, should I try to update the bindings or do you have any other recommendations how to get it running?</div><div><br></div><div>Regards,</div><div>Christoffer Hamberg</div>
