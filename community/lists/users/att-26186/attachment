<div dir="ltr">I have installed OpenMPI 1.6.5 under cygwin. When trying test example<br><br>$mpirun hello <br><br>or, e.g., more complex examples from scalapack, such as<br><br>$mpirun -np 4 xslu<br><br>everything works fine when there is an internet connection. However, when the cable is disconnected, mpirun hangs without any error message. With -d option the output stops before the line <br><br>[my_computer...] [[3169,1],0] node[0].name my_computer... daemon0<br><br>which is included in the output when the internet is on.<br><br>The firewall is turned off. <br>I tried also to add options: -host localhost, -mca btl self, --mca btl_tcp_if_include “<a href="http://127.0.0.1/8">127.0.0.1/8</a>” and their combinations, but nothing has changed.<br><br>Thank you in advance for advice.<br><br>Klara Hornisova<br><br></div>
