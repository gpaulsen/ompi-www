    If we enable a different set of run time library paths for Intel
    compilers than those used to build OMPI when we compile and execute
    the MPI app these new run-time libs will be accessible to OMPI libs
    to run against instead of those used when OMPI was being built
    right? I would think that this may cause some problems if for some
    reason something in the modern run-time libfs differs from the ones
    used when OMPI was built ?<br>
    <br>
    A user is hoping to avoid rebuilding his OMPI app but i guess just
    change LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the latest Intel compile run-time libs and
    just launch it with teh latest and greatest Intel Libs.... I
    mentioned to him that the right way is to build the combination of
    OMPI + Intel run-time that the application is known to work with
    (since some may fail) but he wants me to insert a fixed run-time lib
    path for OMPI libs but use different and variable one for the
    run-time libs of the OMPI application! It is frustrating with people
    who get "great ideas" but then they presss someone else to make them
    work instead of doing this themselves....<br>
    <br>
    anyway thanks....<br>

            The "easy" way to accomplish this would be to:</div>
          <div><br>
          </div>
          <div>(a) build OMPI with whatever compiler you decide to use
            as a "baseline"</div>
          <div><br>
          </div>
          <div>(b) do -not- use the wrapper compiler to build the
            application. Instead, do "mpicc --showme" (or whatever
            language equivalent you want) to get the compile line,
            substitute your "new" compiler library for the "old" one,
            and then execute the resulting command manually.</div>
          <div><br>
          </div>
          <div>If you then set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the "new" libs,
            it might work - but no guarantees. Still, you could try it -
            and if it worked, you could always just explain that this is
            a case-by-case situation, and so it -could- break with other
            compiler combinations.</div>
          <div><br>
          </div>
          <div>Critical note: the app developers would have to validate
            the code with every combination!Â Otherwise, correct
            execution will be a complete crap-shoot - just because the
            app doesn't abnormally terminate does -not- mean it
            generated a correct result!</div>

              &gt; Thanks for the information on this. We indeed use
              Intel Compiler set 11.1.XXX + OMPI 1.4.1 and ...</font></p>
