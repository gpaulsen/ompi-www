Thanks for the tips Gus. I&#39;ll definitely try some of these, particularly the nodes:ppn syntax, and report back.<br><br>Right now, I&#39;m upgrading the Intel Compilers and rebuilding Open MPI.<br><br><br><div class="gmail_quote">

<div id=":1df">The [Torque/PBS] syntax &#39;-l procs=48&#39; is somewhat troublesome,<br>
and may not be understood by the scheduler [It doesn&#39;t<br>
work correctly with Maui, which is what we have here.  I read<br>
people saying it works with pbs_sched and with Moab,<br>
but that&#39;s hearsay.]<br>
This issue comes back very often in the Torque mailing<br>
list.<br>
<br>
Have you tried instead this alternate syntax?<br>
<br>
&#39;-l nodes=2:ppn=24&#39;<br>
<br>
[I am assuming here that your<br>
nodes have 24 cores, i.e. 24 &#39;ppn&#39;, each]<br>
<br>
Then in the script:<br>
mpiexec -np 48 ./your_program<br>
<br>
<br>
Also, in your PBS script you could print<br>
the contents of PBS_NODEFILE.<br>
<br>
cat $PBS_NODEFILE<br>
<br>
<br>
A simple troubleshooting test is to launch &#39;hostname&#39;<br>
with mpirun<br>
<br>
mpirun -np 48 hostname<br>
<br>
Finally, are you sure that the OpenMPI you are using was<br>
compiled with Torque support?<br>
If not, I wonder if clauses like &#39;-bynode&#39; would work at all.<br>
Jeff may correct me if I am wrong, but if your<br>
OpenMPI lacks Torque support,<br>
you may need to pass to mpirun<br>
the $PBS_NODEFILE as your hostfile.</div></blockquote></div><br><br clear="all"><br>-- <br><div><div></div><div>Edmund Sumbar<font color="#999999"><br>University of Alberta<br></font></div><div><font color="#999999">+1 780 492 9360</font></div>
