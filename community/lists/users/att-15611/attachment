    I need to find a way of controlling the rsa key used when open-mpi
    uses ssh to access hosts.&nbsp; By default, ssh uses the <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~/.ssh/id_rsa<br>
    <br>
    However, I need to set the key used without messing around with
    users' .ssh directories.&nbsp; It appears that in a default installation
    of open-mpi, ~/.ssh is specfied is mca_base_param_file_path.&nbsp; Can I
    change the ssh directory used by setting this mca param? Or is there
    some other way of specifying the id_rsa file (other than changing
    ssh config files).<br>
    <br>
    More generally, is there anything posted that states in detail what
    mca_base_param_file_path controls?&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    I've found a reference to it in the FAQ: "The MCA
    parameter (mca_base_param_file_path) specifies the path to search
    for
    AMCA files with relative paths. By default this is
    <code>$SYSCONFDIR/amca-param-sets/:$CWD</code>."&nbsp;&nbsp; From this
    description, it doesn't like setting mca_base_param_file_path will
    solve my problem.<br>
    <br>
    thanks<br>
