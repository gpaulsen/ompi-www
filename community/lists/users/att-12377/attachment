Now, I think I know what the problem is. Basically, the NAG Fortran compiler and its libraries are only available on the master node so that the remaining nodes cannot access/find the required files. From my understanding, the only way to fix this would be put to copy the NAG Fortran compiler to all of the nodes in the cluster.<br>

Don&#39;t NAG provide static copies of their libraries?<br>
Yes, if you link the dynamic libraries, you must make them visible on each node, with the path set in LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  On such a small cluster, (or with a fast shared file system), a usual way is to put them in a directory mounted across all nodes.<br>


Since you talk about a &quot;work-around,&quot; you can copy the library folder to your own file system for each node, to check that you&#39;ve got the hang of it.<br>
The LD_LIBRARY_PATH setting can be done in your user settings so it doesn&#39;t affect anyone else.<br><font color="#888888">
