<div dir="ltr">Hi All,<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wanted to switch from mpich2/mvapich2 to OpenMPI, as OpenMPI supports both ethernet and infiniband. Before doing that I tested an application &#39;GROMACS&#39; to compare the performance of MPICH2 &amp; OpenMPI. Both have been compiled with GNU compilers.<br>
<br>After this benchmark, I came to know that OpenMPI is slower than MPICH2.<br><br>This benchmark is run on a AMD dual core, dual opteron processor. Both have compiled with default configurations.<br><br>The job is run on 2 nodes - 8 cores.<br>
<br>OpenMPI - 25 m 39 s.<br>MPICH2&nbsp; -&nbsp; 15 m 53 s.<br><br>Any comments ..?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Sangamesh<br></div>
