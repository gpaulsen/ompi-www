<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp; I had the following setup:</div>
<div>&nbsp;Rank 0 process on node 1 wants to send an array of particular size&nbsp;to&nbsp;Rank 1 process on&nbsp;same node.</div>
<div>1.&nbsp;What are the optimisations that can be done/invoked while&nbsp;running mpirun&nbsp; to perform this memory to memory transfer efficiently?</div>
<div>2. Is there any performance gain&nbsp; if 2 processes that are exchanging&nbsp;data arrays are kept on the same node rather than on different nodes connected by infiniband?</div>
<div>&nbsp;Awaiting a reply,</div>
