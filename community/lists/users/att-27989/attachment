<body class='hmmessage'><div dir='ltr'>Hello,<br><br>can any one give me a simple example how to multiply two matrices in java openmpi ?<br><br>I can not understand the difference between if-clauses in openmpi, for example:<br>1- if-clause to check the master process (rank 0), then I send an array to process 2 (rank 1).<br>2- if-clause to check if this process the second process, then I write what I want.<br>3- if-clause to receive the result from process 2<br><br>In which order should I write these conditions? does each rank (or processor) execute the main method or the main method will be only one time executed?<br>What could happen when I check if something was received from other process (but it has not been received)? is it an error?<br><br>I am new in openmpi. I hope that you explain it to me.<br><br>Thanks in advance<br><br><br> 		 	   		  </div></body>
