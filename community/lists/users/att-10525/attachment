Hi all,<br>A simple program at my 4-node ROCKS cluster runs fine with command:<br><br>/opt/openmpi/bin/mpirun -np 4 -machinefile machines ./mpi-ring<br><br><br>Another bigger programs runs fine on the head node only with command:<br>
<br>cd ./sphere; /opt/openmpi/bin/mpirun -np 4 ../bin/flo2d<br><br>But with the command:<br><br>cd /sphere; /opt/openmpi/bin/mpirun -np 4 -machinefile ../machines ../bin/flo2d <br><br>It gives output that:<br><br>../bin/flo2d: error while loading shared libraries: libGLU.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory<br>
../bin/flo2d: error while loading shared libraries: libGLU.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory<br>../bin/flo2d: error while loading shared libraries: libGLU.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory<br>
<br>(cursor blinking here)<br><br><br>===================================<br><br>Please fix it.<br>Note that with this bigger code the exe file is in different location than the ./sphere.<br>Openmpi is installed with GNU compilers.<br>
<br>Best Regards,<br>Amjad Ali<br><br>
