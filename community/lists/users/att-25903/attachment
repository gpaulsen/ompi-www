&gt;&gt; Are you referring to something Adam Moody proposed?  Or some other Adam?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; He did more than proposing, he provided a link to the implementation in SCR. So yes, I was indeed referring to Adam Moody.<br>
<br>
</span>Ah -- you&#39;re referring to <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/users/2014/11/25871.php" target="_blank">http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/users/2014/11/25871.php</a>.  Got it.<br>
<span class=""><br>
&gt;&gt; FWIW, we’ve traditionally named Open MPI-specific extensions &quot;OMPI_&quot; instead of &quot;MPIX_&quot; (which can be confused with other MPI implementation extensions).<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Indeed, it was a choice we made long ago. Thinking about this retroactively it was a bad choice. We (UTK) maintain some of the extensions, and as other MPI libraries start providing similar extensions (while they are discussed in the MPI Forum), users start asking for a common naming scheme in order to simplify their life.<br>
<br>
</span>I&#39;ve talked to users who ask for the opposite -- since MPI extensions are, by definition, specific to a particular MPI implementation, they specifically asked for OMPI MPI extensions to *not* be MPIX_*, because then it&#39;s easy to identify that it&#39;s an Open MPI extension (vs. an extension for some other MPI implementation).<br>
<span class=""><br>
&gt; Other than a preferential reason, what other competing reason do we have to stick with OMPI_ instead of MPIX_?<br>
<br>
</span>I think it&#39;s largely informal, so we can do whatever we want.<br>
<br>
The namespace MPIX_ is not regulated (nor mandated), so there&#39;s possibilities for collisions, which would be pretty dreadful for users.<br>
<br>
I like the OMPI_ prefix because it clearly identifies the function as specific to Open MPI (i.e., you really should enclose it in #if defined(OPEN_MPI) / #endif).<br>
<br>
If you/users really want MPIX_, how about: use OMPI_Foo as the &quot;real&quot; name, and have alternate entry points via MPIX_Foo?  (via #define, wrapper functions, or whatever)<br>
<br>
Then we all win.  Huzzah!<br>
