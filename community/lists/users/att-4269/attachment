<div>Thanks a lot for your comments Jeff..</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I will try some of your advices.. and further I will let you know... in the mean time we can try at least to convince the old school of MPIers to include the Pascal interface... :)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Best regards</div>

<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably as Daniël knows there is almost no reference on the MPI<br>&gt; for Pascal interface, only some very few tryes, one of them in<br>&gt; Russian.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know if there is someone working on the interface
<br>&gt; of OpenMPI for Pascal?<br><br>There was a mail or two about it a while ago; you might want to dig<br>through the OMPI list archives.&nbsp;&nbsp;The short version is that none of<br>the current Open MPI members have a desire to add Pascal bindings to
<br>MPI.&nbsp;&nbsp;It also might be somewhat of an uphill battle to convince the<br>old-school MPI&#39;ers to include a Pascal interface in Open MPI, even if<br>it was developed by a 3rd party and contributed to the project.<br><br>
However, that should not deter you from pursuing a Pascal interface<br>if you want one.&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditionally, extensions to MPI have been<br>implemented in an MPI-neutral fashion and released into the wild as<br>3rd party libraries (such as the C++ bindings for MPI several years
<br>ago).&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pascal bindings likely don&#39;t need to know anything about<br>the internals of an MPI implementation -- they can just call the C<br>bindings.&nbsp;&nbsp;So it&#39;s possible/likely that you would write up a Pascal<br>
interface that would work with both Open MPI and MPICH (and any other<br>MPI&#39;s out there).<br><br>As I typed out the above, I have a dim recollection of the Pascal<br>interface needing to obtain the values of the C constants during its
<br>setup/compilation phase (note that these values are going to be<br>different between different MPI implementations).&nbsp;&nbsp;You have a few<br>options here; you could write a parser for mpi.h to extract the<br>values you need (
e.g., in perl or somesuch) or write a short C<br>program to extract them and printf the values that you capture into a<br>Pascal header file or something (I&#39;m not sure if you need the literal<br>or symbolic values -- I remember very little of Pascal).&nbsp;&nbsp;Either way,
<br>with a little diligence and creativity, it could probably be done.<br><br>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also I&#39;m putting a very newbie question: What is the main<br>&gt; difference between the OpenMPI and MPICH ?<br><br>Short version: we&#39;re different projects implementing the same API
