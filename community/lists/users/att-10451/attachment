My answer: Yes and No. Yes, when I used ifort compiler. But the problem
did not show up when I used gfortran, which was much slower.<br>

Okay.&nbsp; So, if this is not an MPI problem, as much as we like you and
wish you luck, this mail list might not be the best place to resolve
this problem!&nbsp; :^)<br>
<br>
Humor aside, there appears to be something special about how the code
is compiled, and the code looks like it's non-trivial.&nbsp; So, you
probably need to pursue this issue somewhere other than this mail
list.&nbsp; I don't know what resources are available to you for pursuing
ifort issues.<br>
<br>
Since you have a working and non-working version, maybe there are ways
of "divide and conquer" to isolate what the essential difference is
between the two.&nbsp; E.g., does the ifort version work at lower
optimization levels?&nbsp; Etc.<br>
<br>
Good luck.&nbsp; I'm sorry, but this mail alias probably isn't the right
place to resolve this particular problem.<br>

(I should know this, but OMPI man pages should probably tell you for
sure.)&nbsp; I suspect the mpi wrappers can be used to invoke "any"
compiler.&nbsp; In any case, it appears you've isolated the problem to be
due to the underlying compilers and not to an MPI component.<br>

Sorry, I'm not familiar with ifort.<br>
