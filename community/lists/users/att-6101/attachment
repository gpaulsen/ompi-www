<div dir="ltr"><br clear="all">Hi,<br>i have a question about parallel i/o. In my application, actually i have implemented a file lock with C system calls, like flock. But, is this the right way to do concurrent write? <br>
<br>In this cluster, every node has our operating system, so, the file lock functions only on the processors of that node, not for all. I can have two or more process of different nodes that writes concurrent in the file. Is this dangerous or not? It&#39;s depends by file system? I&#39;m using MPI-1 under OpenMPI. <br>
