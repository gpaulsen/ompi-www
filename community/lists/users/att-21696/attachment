I just built 1.7.  If I distribute the binary, it works fine.  If I use the --preload-binary option, it prints<div><br></div><div>[warn] opal_libevent2019_event_base_loop: reentrant invocation.  Only one event_base_loop can run on each event_base at once.</div>
<div><br></div><div>many times per second.</div><div><br></div><div>I have bit of an odd configuration: The admins in my organization are too busy to support us, so the installation is in a home folder rather than in the system folders.  That also means no NFS, so it&#39;s kind of nice to have the binary distributed by the root node.  I configured with --disable-dlopen, and use -x PATH -x LD_LIBRARY_PATH in the mpirun invocation.  As I said, it works fine if the binary is pre-distributed, but the --preload-binary and ---preload-files options both cause this problem.  This problem occurs with the head node and one slave---I haven&#39;t tried larger configurations.</div>
