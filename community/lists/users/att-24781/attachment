        <p>I have a loop in which I will do some MPI_Isend.
According to the MPI standard, for every send you need a recv!!!!</p>

<p>If one or several of my MPI_Isend have zero size buffer, should I 
still have the mpi_recv or I can do it without recv? I mean on the 
processor which I should recv the data I know priory that my buffer is 
with zero size. Can I jump from MPI_Recv.</p>

<p>The question is because of the format of the program I am using if it
 knows that the receiving buffer is zero it will not call the routine 
which contains mpi_Recv.Â </p><p><br></p><p><br></p></div></div>
