release of the &quot;unbreakable&quot; / bug-free version Open MPI 2009,<br>(expected to be available by mid-2011).  This release is essentially a<br>complete rewrite of Open MPI based on new technologies such as C#,<br>Java, and object-oriented Cobol (so say we all!).  Buffer overflows<br>
and memory leaks are now things of the past.  We strongly recommend<br>that all users upgrade to Windows 7 to fully take advantage of the new<br>powers embedded in Open MPI.<br><br>This version can be downloaded from the The Onion web site or from<br>
many BitTorrent networks (seeding now; the Open MPI ISO is<br>approximately 3.97GB -- please wait for the full upload).<br><br>Here is an abbreviated list of changes in Open MPI 2009 as compared to<br>the previous version:<br>
<br>- Dropped support for MPI 2 in favor of the newly enhanced MPI 11.7<br> standard.  MPI_COOK_DINNER support is only available with additional<br> equipment (some assembly may be required).  An experimental PVM-like<br>
 API has been introduced to deal with the current limitations of the<br> MPI 11.7 API.<br>- Added a Twitter network transport capable of achieving peta-scale<br> per second bandwidth (but only on useless data).<br>- Dropped support for the barely-used x86 and x86_64 architectures in<br>
 favor of the most recent ARM6 architecture.  As a direct result,<br> several Top500 sites are planning to convert from their now obsolete<br> peta-scale machines to high-reliability iPhone clusters using the<br> low-latency AT&amp;T 3G network.<br>
- The iPhone iMPI app (powered by iOpen MPI) is now downloadable from<br> the iTunes Store.  Blackberry support will be included in a future<br> release.<br>- Fix all compiler errors related to the PGI 8.0 compiler by<br>
 completely dropping support.<br>- Add some &quot;green&quot; features for energy savings.  The new &quot;--bike&quot;<br> mpirun option will only run your parallel jobs only during the<br> operation hours of the official Open MPI biking team.  The<br>
 &quot;--preload-result&quot; option will directly embed the final result in<br> the parallel execution, leading to more scalable and reliable runs<br> and decreasing the execution time of any parallel application under<br>
 the real-time limit of 1 second.  Open MPI is therefore EnergyStar<br> compliant when used with these options.<br>- In addition to moving Open MPI&#39;s lowest point-to-point transports to<br> be an external project, limited support will be offered for<br>
 industry-standard platforms.  Our focus will now be to develop<br> highly scalable transports based on widely distributed technologies<br> such as SMTP, High Performance Gopher (v3.8 and later), OLE COMM,<br> RSS/Atom, DNS, and Bonjour.<br>
- Opportunistic integration with Conflicker in order to utilize free<br> resources distributed world-wide.<br>- Support for all Fortran versions prior to Fortran 2020 has been<br> dropped.<br><br>Make today an Open MPI day!<br>
