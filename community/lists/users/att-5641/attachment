Hi.<br><br>Out of curiosity, was looking to know -<br><br>Query#1: Does OpenMPI has any document related with OpenMPI Internals?<br><br>Query#2: Does any slides talks of OpenMPI internals, If yes, any links for the same?<br>
<br>Query#3: Do any Static-Analysis open-source tools are available for analyzing OpenMPI? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Probably, Coverity &quot;Prevent&quot; does provide static-analysis but&nbsp; does it work for OpenMPI too?<br><br>Any links or reference is appreciated.<br><br>BR
