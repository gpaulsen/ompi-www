Hi all,<BR>
I am wondering if there is&nbsp;an flush()-like function in MPI. I saw the&nbsp;output of my program. One sent something but some other process did not receive it, just sitting there waiting. I used MPI_Isend for sending and MPI_Recv for receiving. Is it possible the message was lost or the message&nbsp;was not flushed out and was still in the I/O buffer. Thanks.<BR>
