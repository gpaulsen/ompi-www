Hello,<br><br>I run into a stange problem with qlogic OFED and openmpi. When i submit (through SGE) 2 jobs on the same node, the second job ends up with:<br><br>(ipath/PSM)[10292]: can&#39;t open /dev/ipath, network down (err=26)<br>

<br>I&#39;m pretty sure the infiniband is working well as the other job runs fine.<br><br>Here is details about the configuration:<br><br>Qlogic HCA: InfiniPath_QMH7342 (2 ports but only one connected to a switch)<br>qlogic_ofed-1.5.3-7.0.0.0.35 (rocks cluster roll)<br>

openmpi 1.5.4 (./configure --with-psm --with-openib --with-sge)<br><br>-------------<br><br>In order to fix this problem i recompiled openmpi without psm support, but i faced an other problem:<br><br>The OpenFabrics (openib) BTL failed to initialize while trying to<br>

allocate some locked memory.  This typically can indicate that the<br>memlock limits are set too low.  For most HPC installations, the<br>memlock limits should be set to &quot;unlimited&quot;.  The failure occured<br>here:<br>

<br>  Local host:    compute-0-6.local<br>  OMPI source:   btl_openib.c:329<br>  Function:      ibv_create_srq()<br>  Device:        qib0<br>  Memlock limit: <b>unlimited</b><br><br><br>
