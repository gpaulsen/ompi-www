<font size=2 face="sans-serif">Hi,</font>
<br>
<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">We have an in-house application where
we run two solvers in a loosely coupled manner: The first solver runs a
timestep, then the second solver does work on the same timestep, etc. As
the two solvers never execute at the same time, we would like to run the
two solvers in the same allocation (launching mpirun once for each of them).
RAM is not an issue, so there should not be any risk of excessive swapping
degrading performance.</font>
<br>
<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">We use openmpi-1.4.5 compiled with torque
integration. The torque integration means we do not give a hostfile to
mpirun, it will itself query torque for the allocation info. </font>
<br>
<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">Question: </font>
<br>
<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">Can we force one of the solvers to run
in a *subset* of the full allocation? How do we do that? I read in the
FAQ that providing a hostfile to mpirun in this case (when it's not needed
due to torque integration) would cause a lot of problems...</font>
<br>
<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">Thanks in advance,</font>
