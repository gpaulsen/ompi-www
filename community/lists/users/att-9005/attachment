Dear all<br><br>I tried to increase speed of a program with openmpi-1.1.3 by adding following 4 parameters into openmpi-mca-params.conf file.<br><br>mpi_leave_pinned=1<br>btl_openib_eager_rdma_num=128<br>btl_openib_max_eager_rdma=128<br>
btl_openib_eager_limit=1024<br><br>and then, I ran my program twice(124 processes on 31 nodes). one with &quot;mpi_leave_pinned=1&quot;, another with &quot;mpi_leave_pinned=0&quot;.<br>All of them were stopped abnormally with &quot;ctrl+c&quot; and &quot;killall -9 &lt;program&gt;&quot;.<br>
After that, I couldn&#39;t start to run that program again. <br>I checked every nodes with &quot;free -m&quot; and I found that huge amount of cached memory were used in each nodes. <br>Could this situation be caused by those 4 parameters? IS there anyway to free theme? <br>
