<div dir="ltr">Hello there, <div><br></div><div>In my fortran code, I used mpi_bcast to broadcast an array Q(21, 51, 140000) (the size for it is 150,000,000) from the root to all the nodes. I found when I used this bcast subroutine, it code will be very slow and sometimes it hangs there. Once I commented this array, this code speed is normal. So I guess that the Q is too large to be broadcast using mpi_bcast. Is my judgement correct?</div>

<div><br></div><div>I think this array is required for my code, but now the troublesome thing is that the speed is slow. Does anybody know how to alleviate this problem ? Or any other alternative problems to make this array Q broadcast from root to other nodes? </div>
