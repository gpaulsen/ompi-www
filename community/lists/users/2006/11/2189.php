<p>
Hello everyone!
<br>
<p>I am a member of a research laboratory in University of Patras, Greece. 
<br>
We have ordered our first cluster and in the following days it will 
<br>
arrive. So, we will need the help of experts in order to decide which 
<br>
cluster management and job scheduling software is the most suitable for it 
<br>
:) .
<br>
<p>Each computer of the cluster consists of: 2 x (Dual-Core Intel Xeon 
<br>
Processor 5060 (3.2 GHz, 1066 MHz Bus)), (motherboard: S5000PAL)
<br>
, 4GB ECC RAM and 250GB HDD. All parts are interconnected with a 
<br>
Gigabit Ethernet Switch.
<br>
<p>What we need, is your opinion and experience for a software package
<br>
(or a collection) that will make easier the use of the cluster (job
<br>
scheduling) as well as the administration of it (update and upgrade of
<br>
the OS, installation of new software, user administration, etc). We are
<br>
proficient with Linux administration (any distro).
<br>
<p>On our first search in the internet, we found some packages that do not
<br>
combine both job scheduling and administration. If there is a package that
<br>
could be suggested and that could combine both we would be really happy.
<br>
We would prefer the software packages to be open source. :)
<br>
<p>Some of them found and studied so far are the following:
<br>
<p>[1] TORQUE Resource Manager
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.clusterresources.com/pages/products/torque-resource-manager.php">http://www.clusterresources.com/pages/products/torque-resource-manager.php</a>
<br>

<br>
[3] <a href="http://oscar.openclustergroup.org/">http://oscar.openclustergroup.org/</a>
<br>
[4] <a href="http://dcc.irb.hr/">http://dcc.irb.hr/</a>
<br>
<p><p>These are some of our thoughts. We know that the distribution choice
<br>
as well as the cluster management software will apply only ONCE and we
<br>
will not be able to test/change it easily...
<br>
<p>Thanks very much for your time and I am sure that your opinion will be
<br>
of of great help to us!
<br>
<p>Michael
