I built a fresh version of lammps v29Jan09 against Open MPI 1.3 which
in turn was built with Gnu compilers v4.2.4 on an Ubuntu 8.04 x86_64
box. This Open MPI build was able to generate usable binaries such as
XHPL and NPB, but the lammps binary it generated was not usable.<br>
<br>
I tried it with a couple of different versions of the lammps source,
but to no avail. No errors during the builds and a binary was created,
but when executing the job it quickly exits with no messages other than:<br>

jpummil@stealth:~$ mpirun -np 4 -hostfile hosts
/home/jpummil/lmp_Stealth-OMPI &lt; in.testbench_small<br>
LAMMPS (22 Jan 2008)<br>
<br>
Interestingly, I downloaded Open MPI 1.2.8, built it with the same
configure options I had used with 1.3, and it worked.<br>
<br>
I'm getting by fine with 1.2.8. I just wanted to file a possible bug
report on 1.3 and see if others have seen this behavior.<br>
<br>
Cheers!<br>
