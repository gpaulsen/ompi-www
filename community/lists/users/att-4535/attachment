Hello Guys,<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;  When is the version 1.3 scheduled to be released? As it would contain checkpointing, library for non-blocking communication, ConnectX for QP's, it would be great to have it ASAP. Since i am evaluating MVAPICH against OpenMPI, i found that MVAPICH still has upper hand in terms of checkpointing. But i am pretty sure, once v1.3 will come, it will help a lot to HPC community.<BR>
<BR>
I can find the development trunk version, but i am more interested in production release version.<BR>
