    Hello,<br>
    <br>
    I built OpenMPI 1.5.3 using NAG compiler v 5.2 on a new system
    running Fedora 15 (with gcc 4.6). OpenMPI can be built successfully,
    but when I compile a Fortran MPI application I got an error at link
    stage:<br>
    <br>
    gcc: error: unrecognized option &#8216;--export-dynamic&#8217;<br>
    <br>
    Note that NAG Fortran compiler generates intermediate C code and
    actually calls gcc to build the application.<br>
    <br>
    GCC 4.6 release note contains the following: "GCC now has stricter
    checks for invalid command-line options. In particular, when <code>gcc</code>
    was called to link object files rather than compile source code, it
    would previously accept and ignore all options starting with <code>--</code>,
    including linker options such as <code>--as-needed</code> and <code>--export-dynamic</code>,
    although such options would result in errors if any source code was
    compiled. Such options, if unknown to the compiler, are now rejected
    in all cases; if the intent was to pass them to the linker, options
    such as <code>-Wl,--as-needed</code> should be used." <br>
    <br>
    My next step was to track down where the illegal syntax was
    generated, using the '-showme' option provided by the OpenMPI
    compiler wrapper and '-dryrun' option provided by NAG compiler.<br>

    nagfor pi.f90 -o pi.exe_nag

    /usr/bin/gcc -I/home/lining/software/NAG_Fortran/lib -c -DANSI_C

    /usr/bin/gcc -o pi.exe_nag
    /home/lining/software/NAG_Fortran/lib/quickfit.o pi.o -pthread
    -L/home/lining/software/openmpi/1.5.3/nag/lib -lmpi_f90 -lmpi_f77
    -lmpi -lnsl -lutil -lm -ldl -lnsl -lutil -lm -ldl
    -Wl,-rpath,/home/lining/software/NAG_Fortran/lib
    /home/lining/software/NAG_Fortran/lib/libf52.so
    /home/lining/software/NAG_Fortran/lib/libf52.a -lm --export-dynamic
    <br>
    <br>
    So OpenMPI generates the '-Wl,--export-dynamic' flag. When this is
    passed to NAG compiler, NAG compiler interprets this as "passing the
    '--export-dynamic' flag to the linker (gcc)" (which I believe is the
    correct behaviour). But gcc 4.6 expects to see
    '-Wl,--export-dynamic'. <br>
    <br>
    My temporary solution as supplied by NAG compiler developers is to
    edit&nbsp; share/openmpi/*-wrapper-data.txt and put flag
    '-Wl,-Wl,,--export-dynamic' there.<br>
