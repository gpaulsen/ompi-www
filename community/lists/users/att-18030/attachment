Dear OMPI Users,<br>          I have just read the messages from Martin Rushton and Jeff Squyres and have been having the same problem trying to get openmp-1.4.4 to work.  My specs are below:<br>                           Xeon(R) CPU 5335 2.00 GHz<br>
                           Linux  SUSE 11.4 (x86_64)<br>                           Linux 2.6.371-1.2 desktop x86_64<br>I go through the compilation process with the commands:<br>                          ./configure --prefix=/opt/openmpi CC=icc CXX=icpc F77=ifort F90=ifort &quot;FCFLAGS=-O3 -i8&quot; &quot;FFLAGS=-O3 -i8&quot; 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee config.out<br>
                           make -j 4 all 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee make.out<br>                           make install 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee install.out.<br>The entire process seems to go properly but when I try to use an example it doesn&#39;t work properly.<br>
                           mpicc hello_c.c -o hello_c<br>compiles properly.  However, <br>                           &quot;./hello_c&quot; gives an error message that it cannot find the file libmpi_so.0.    There are at least 3 copies of the file present as found by the search command but none of these are found.  I have checked the permissions and they seem to be OK so I am at the same point as Martin Rushton.  I hope that somebody comes up with an anser soon.<br>
