Hello,<br><br>I&#39;n trying to get functions like orte-checkpoint, orte-restart,... works but there are some errors that I don&#39;t have any clue about.<br><br>Blcr (0.8.2) works fine apparently and  I have installed openmpi 1.4.2 from source with option blcr. <br>
The command<br>mpirun -np 4  -am ft-enable-cr ./checkpoint_test<br>seemed OK but <br>orte-checkpoint --term PID_of_checkpoint_test ( obtaining after ps -ef | grep mpirun )<br>does not return and shows nothing like errors!<br>
<br>Then, I checked with <br>ompi-ps<br>this time, I obtain:<br>oob-tcp: Communication retries exceeded.  Can not communicate with peer<br><br>Does anyone has the same problem?<br>Any idea is welcomed!<br>Thanks,<br>Son.<br>
