<div dir="ltr">Hello,<div><br></div><div>Say I don&#39;t have access to a actual cluster, yet I&#39;m considering cloud compute solutions for my MPI program ultimately, but such a cost may be highly prohibitive at the moment.</div><div>In terms of middle ground, if I am interesting in compute only, no storage, what are possible hardware solutions out there to deploy my MPI program?<br>By no storage, I mean that my control linux box running the frontend of the program, but is also part of the mpi communicator always gathers all results and stores them locally.<br>At the moment, I have a second box over ethernet.</div><div><br></div><div>I am looking at something like Intel Compute Stick (is it possible at all to buy a few, is linux running on them, the arch seems to be the same x86-64, is there a possible setup with tcp for those and have openmpi over tcp)?</div><div><br>Is it more cost-effective to look at extra regular linux commodity boxes?<br>If a no hard drive box is possible, can the executables of my MPI program sendable over the wire before running them?</div><div><br></div><div>If we exclude GPU or other nonMPI solutions, and cost being a primary factor, what is progression path from 2boxes to a cloud based solution (amazon and the like...)</div><div><br></div><div>Regards,</div><div>MM</div></div>
