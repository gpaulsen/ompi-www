&gt; You will find the MPI Fortran 2008 bindings to be significantly better<br>
&gt; w.r.t. MPI types.  See e.g. MPI 3.1 section 17.2.5 where it describes<br>
&gt; TYPE(MPI_Status), which means that the status object is a first-class type<br>
&gt; in the Fortran 2008 interface, rather than being an error prone INTEGER<br>
&gt; array.<br>
<br>
You might expect the f90 module to reveal the error anyway.<br>
Unfortunately which routines it covers depends on the compiler and OMPI<br>
versions in a way I don&#39;t understand -- can someone explain?  For<br>
instance, it won&#39;t work with the RHEL6 system compiler (GCC 4.4), but<br>
OMPI 1.8 using GCC 4.9 will report the error with &quot;use mpi&quot;.<br>
<br>
&gt; I haven&#39;t used Fortran 2008 bindings in a nontrivial way yet, but it is my<br>
&gt; understanding that Open-MPI has a good implementation of them and has for a<br>
&gt; relatively long time.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately they won&#39;t be built if you use the system compiler on<br>
RHEL6 (which I&#39;d guess is still be the most common HPC platform).<br>
Aren&#39;t they meant to address different problems with the subroutine<br>
signatures anyway?  But strong typing is definitely good.<br>
