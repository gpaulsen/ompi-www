<br>
I wonder if there is a way to address this particular scenario using MPI_T or other strategies in Open MPI. I saw a similar discussion few days ago, I assume the same challenges are applied in this case but I just want to check. Here is the scenario:<br>
<br>
We have a system composed by dual rail Mellanox IB, two distinct Connect-IB cards per node each one sitting on a different PCI-E lane out of two distinct sockets. We are seeking a way to control MPI traffic thought each one of them directly into the application. In specific we have a single MPI rank per node that goes multi-threading using OpenMP. MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE is used, each OpenMP thread may initiate MPI communication. We would like to assign IB-0 to thread 0 and IB-1 to thread 1.<br>
<br>
Via mpirun or env variables we can control which IB interface to use by binding it to a specific MPI rank (or by apply a policy that relate IB to MPi ranks). But if there is only one MPI rank active, how we can differentiate the traffic across multiple IB cards?<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance for any suggestion about this matter.<br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
Filippo<br>
