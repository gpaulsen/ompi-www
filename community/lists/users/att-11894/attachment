Hi all,<br><br>       If an infiniband network is configured successfully, how to confirm that Open MPI is using infiniband, not other ethernet network available?<br><br>In earlier versions, I&#39;ve seen if OMPI is running on ethernet, it was giving warning - its runnig on slower network. Is this available in 1.3.3 version also?<br>
The linux command &quot;netstat&quot;, does not confirm this as OMPI works on RDMA.<br><br>Thanks<br>
