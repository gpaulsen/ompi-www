<p>Jeff paraphrased an unnamed source as suggesting that<tt>: &quot;any MPI program that relies on a barrier for correctness is an incorrect MPI application.</tt>&quot; .  That is probably too strong.<br>
<br>
How about this assertion?<br>
<br>
<b>If there are no wildcard receives - every MPI_Barrier call is semantically irrelevant.</b><br>
<br>
It is the exception that tests the rule. <br>
<br>
If someone can provide an example of an MPI_Barrier that is required by an application based on MPI  communication and that does not use wildcard receive I am interested in seeing it. I do not know of a counter example but also do not have proof of the assertion I place before the group.<br>
<br>
No fair using examples with non-MPI interactions among tasks or with job steering by asynchronous triggers from outside the job. I can construct them myself. <br>
<br>
MPI_WIN_FENCE is semantically required in some situations and examples that show a semantic need for MPI_WIN_FENCE do not count against the assertion.<br>
<br>
I have appreciated the descriptions from Gus,  Asjley and others of some non-symantic justifications for an MPI_Barrier.<br>
