<html><body><div style="color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:10pt"><div><br><span></span></div>Dear people, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let say there are N MPI processes. Each MPI process has to communicate with some T processes, where T &lt; N. This information is a directed graph (and every process knows only about its own). I need to convert it to undirected graph, so that each process will inform T other processes about it. Every process will update this information. (that may be stored in an array of maximum size N). What can be the best way to exchange this information among all MPI processes ? MPI_AllGather and MPI_AllGatherv do not solve my problem. <br><br><br>best regards,<br><br><br>-- Mudassar<br></div></body></html>
