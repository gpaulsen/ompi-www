<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">We have been&nbsp;using the Argonne&nbsp;MPICH (over TCP/IP) on our in-house designed embedded multicomputer for last several months with satisfactory results. Our network technology is custom built and is * 
<b><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">not</span></b>* infiniband (or any published standards, such as Myrinet) based. This is due to the nature of our application. We are currently running TCP/IP over out backplane network and using that as the transport layer of MPICH.

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">For the next generation of our software release, we are planning to write a low level transport layer&nbsp;to leverage our switch architecture and considering changing the entire MPI protocol stack to openMPI. From what I have found so far, I'd have to write routines to provide services similar to the ones found under ompi/mca/btl/{tcp,mx,...}. I'd like to get some guidance as to how to do this. Is there a document about this? Has anybody in this list done something similar before and if so, what was the difficulty level involved?
