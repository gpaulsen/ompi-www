<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp; after installing pwscf and running an example, I got a warning message related to the MCA parameter. To fix it I have tried all the steps indicated in the FAQ link but it doesn't work. please which command I have to use and from which directory can use it. perhaps I didn't use the right one.<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; Yours sincerely,<BR><BR></DIV>
