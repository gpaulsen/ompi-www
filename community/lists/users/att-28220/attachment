&gt; Hello Open MPI Gurus,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; As I explore MPI-OpenMP hybrid codes, I&#39;m trying to figure out how to do<br>
&gt; things to get the same behavior in various stacks. For example, I have a<br>
&gt; 28-core node (2 14-core Haswells), and I&#39;d like to run 4 MPI processes and 7<br>
&gt; OpenMP threads. Thus, I&#39;d like the processes to be 2 processes per socket<br>
&gt; with the OpenMP threads laid out on them. Using a &quot;hybrid Hello World&quot;<br>
&gt; program, I can achieve this with Intel MPI (after a lot of testing):<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; Other than the odd fact that Process #0 seemed to start on Socket #1 (this<br>
&gt; might be an artifact of how I&#39;m trying to detect the CPU I&#39;m on), this looks<br>
&gt; reasonable. 14 threads on each socket and each process is laying out its<br>
&gt; threads in a nice orderly fashion.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I&#39;m trying to figure out how to do this with Open MPI (version 1.10.0) and<br>
&gt; apparently I am just not quite good enough to figure it out. The closest<br>
&gt; I&#39;ve gotten is:<br>

&gt; Obviously not right. Any ideas on how to help me learn? The man mpirun page<br>
&gt; is a bit formidable in the pinning part, so maybe I&#39;ve missed an obvious<br>
&gt; answer.<br>
