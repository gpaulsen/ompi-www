<html><body><div style="color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt"><div>Hi all,</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>I am experiencing a rather unpleasant issue with a simple OpenMPI app. I have 4 nodes communicating with a central node. Performance is good and the application behaves as it should. (i.e. performance <span id="misspell-1"><span>steadily</span></span> decreases as I increase the work size). My problem is that immediately after messages passed between nodes become larger that 128 KB performance drops suddenly in an unexpected way. I have done some research and tried to <span id="misspell-1">modify</span> various eager limits, without any success. I am a beginner in OpenMPI and I can't seem to figure out this issue. I am hopping that one of you might shed some light on this situation. My OpenMPI version is 1.5.4 on Ubuntu Server 10.04 64 bit. Any help is welcome.
 Thanks.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Adrian </div></div></body></html>
