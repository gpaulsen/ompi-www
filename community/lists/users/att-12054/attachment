hello,<br>we have installed open mpi 1.2 using synaptic package manager in 2 machines running on ubuntu 8.10 and ubuntu 8.04.the hello.c program runs correctly,but connectivity_c.c program included in the openmpi tarball example fails when we it tries to communicate between both computers.also on the 8.04 version we get  an error of &quot;unable to find any HCA&#39;s will use another transport instead&quot;.on the 8.10 machine we get an error &quot;unable to find executable:a.out host:ip of node&quot;.<br>
however the programs run without errors when we specify  only localhost in hostfile.we have set up PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH,but still get same errors. <br>
