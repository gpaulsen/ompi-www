Hi,<br><br>I recently installed Open MPI. And I can get my program compiled and run.<br>There is a small problem:<br>Previously, when using LAM, I use the following command line to submit my jobs:<br>nohup mpirun n1-4 ~/bin/mympi.LAM &gt; 
output.txt &amp;<br><br>But, with Open MPI, I can only run the program at foreground by<br>mpirun -np 4 --hostfile myhosts ~/bin/mympi.OMPI<br>If adding &quot;nohup&quot; and &quot;&gt; output.txt &amp;&quot;, the submitted job will stop immediately.
<br>However, when I check on the slave nodes, I can still see the job and the orted<br>by &quot;ps -u&quot;. I have to manually kill them. <br><br>Any suggestion?<br><br>Thanks
