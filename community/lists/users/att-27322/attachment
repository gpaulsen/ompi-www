<div style="direction: ltr;font-family: Tahoma;color: #000000;font-size: 10pt;">I'm just curious, if we run an OpenMPI job and it makes use of non-local memory<br>
(i.e. memory tied to another socket) what kind of effects are seen on performance?<br>
<br>
How would you go about testing the above? I can't think of any command line parameter that<br>
would allow one to split an OpenMPI process across sockets.<br>
<br>
I'd imagine it would be pretty bad since you can't cache non-local memory locally,<br>
the fact both the request and data have to flow through an IOH, the local CPU would<br>
have to compete w/the non-local CPU for access to its own memory and that doing this<br>
would have to implemented w/some sort of software semaphore locks (which would add<br>
even more overhead).<br>
