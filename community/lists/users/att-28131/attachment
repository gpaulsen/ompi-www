<div dir="ltr"><div><div><div>Dear All,<br><br></div>If you are switching/rebulding the openmpi releases on your computer time to time. Your latest openmpi build ( not the latest release) which you are trying to install can not change the symbolic links of the openmpi libraries in /usr/local/lib directory. After you built your the last openmpi, the symbolic links of the library files may refer to the previously installed openmpi libraries. These library conflicts may cause segmentation faults on mpirun.<br><br></div>FYI &amp; B.Regards,<br></div>Dogan<br></div>
