<font size=2 face="sans-serif">I use OpenMPI on a variety of platforms:
&nbsp;stand-alone servers running Solaris on sparc boxes and Linux (mostly
CentOS) on AMD/Intel boxes, also Linux (again CentOS) on large clusters
of AMD/Intel boxes. &nbsp;These platforms all have some version of the
1.3 OpenMPI stream. &nbsp;I recently requested an upgrade on all systems
to 1.4.3 (for production work) and 1.5.1 (for experimentation). &nbsp;I'm
getting a lot of push back from the SysAdmin folks claiming that OpenMPI
is closely intertwined with the specific version of the operating system
and/or other system software (i.e., Rocks on the clusters). &nbsp;I need
to know if they are telling me the truth or if they're just making excuses
to avoid the work. &nbsp;To state my question another way: &nbsp;Apparently
each release of Linux and/or Rocks comes with some version of OpenMPI bundled
in. &nbsp;Is it dangerous in some way to upgrade to a newer version of
OpenMPI? &nbsp;Thanks in advance for any insight anyone can provide.</font>
