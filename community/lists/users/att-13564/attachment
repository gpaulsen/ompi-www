Hey guys,<div><br></div><div>This is my first time posting on an email list, so if I don&#39;t follow certain protocols just tell me. Anyway, I am working at a research lab as a High School Summer Intern, and part of my project involves installing OpenMPI on a Windows machine to run some applications in virtual clusters. I tried following the first two methods from the Windows ReadMe file, but none of them work. For the first one, there are a bunch of header files cMake can&#39;t find. For the second one, the cannot find the ompi-static.tgz tarball. The set of files that I downloaded from OpenMPI can be found here (tried both tars): <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v1.4/">http://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v1.4/</a> .</div>

<div><br></div><div>I noticed however that the ompi-static tarball can be found in the Subversion that i obtained this way:<a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/svn/mercurial.php">http://www.open-mpi.org/svn/mercurial.php</a> . Can anyone tell me what I might be doing wrong? Or maybe more detailed steps? it&#39;s the first time I work with OpenMPI or any similar technologies.</div>

<div><br></div><div>Thanks for your help,</div><div>Alex Blidaru</div>
