Hi All,<br><br>I had been using open-mpi for parallel computing on Fedora and Ubuntu and everything was going quite fine. But recently I started using other OSs such as CentOS and Debian and found a strange thing regarding mpi. I found that running the same source code on these OS, with the same versions of of gcc and open-mpi installed on them, gives different results than Fedora and Ubuntu after a few hundred iterations. The first few hundered iterations are exactly similar to that of  Fedora and Ubuntu but then it starts giving different results. The source code which I am using has really good behaviour on Fedora and Ubuntu and gives exact results as expected. <br>
I tried changing the versions of open-mpi, gcc, fftw3 one by one got no improvement at all. The strange thing is that the results are quite similar for a while and then change mysteriously.<br><br>Are there any issues in using open-mpi on CentOS and Debian? What exactly we need to do with mpi commands if we go from Fedora/Ubuntu to CentOS/Debian?<br>
<br>Many thanks in advance for your help. <br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Asad<br clear="all"><br>-- <br>&quot;Statistical thinking will one day be as necessary for efficient citizenship as the ability to read and write.&quot; - H.G. Wells<br>
