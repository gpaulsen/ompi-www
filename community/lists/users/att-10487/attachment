Hello Everyone,<br><br>I have a problem that I can&#39;t seem to figure out from searching the mailing list archive. I have a code that repeatedly spawns (via MPI_COMM_SPAWN) a group of 8 processes and then waits for them to finish. The problem is that OpenMPI (I&#39;ve tried 1.3.1 and 1.3.3) opens a pipe each time MPI_COMM_SPAWN is called, but this pipe never gets closed (even if I call MPI_COMM_FREE on both the parent and child). Therefore, eventually my master process hits the limit of open file descriptors and cannot spawn any more. I cannot figure out why this is happening since I am only spawning 8 jobs at a time.<br>
<br>I should note that I don&#39;t exchange any data over the child intercommunicators -- they exist solely so I can call MPI_BARRIER on them (the spawned processes are programed to call MPI_BARRIER directly before they call MPI_FINALIZE, thus indicating that they are done doing their work). <br>
<br>I&#39;d appreciate any suggestions as to what I might be doing wrong with this that is causing OpenMPI to hold the pipes open.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Tim M.<br>
