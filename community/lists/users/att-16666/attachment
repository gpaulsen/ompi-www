Hi,<br>I am trying to run MPI applications using OpenMPI in OFED Cluster (over IB).  I am trying to find whether OpenMPI supports a transport interface which is based on libibverbs layer in OFED (I mean, which does not use connection manager in OFED) ?<br>
<br>Thanks you in advance.<br><br>Thanks &amp; Regards,<br>Ramu <br>
