Dear,<br><div class="gmail_quote">

I am a new user of open mpi. I have already installed openmpi and build 
hpl. I want to checkpoint/restart hpl and compare its performance<br>
<br>
Please can you point me to a useful link that will guide me through this checkpointing of hpl.<br>
<br>
thanks in advance.<br>
