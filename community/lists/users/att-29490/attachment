<div>Thanks Jeff for your answer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It is sad that the approach I mentioned of having all memory registered for user process on cluster nodes didn&#8217;t become more popular.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I still believe that such an approach would shorten the executed code path in MPI libraries, reduce message latency, increase the communication/computation overlap potential and allows communication progress more naturally.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>But now since we have to live with memory registration issues, what changes should be done to standard Linux distro so that Open MPI can best use a recent Mellanox Infiniband network ?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I guess that installing the ummunotify kernel module is a good idea ?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Maybe also removing the limits on the &#8220;max locked memory&#8221; (ulimit -l) is also good ? </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Beside that, I guess that installing the latest OFED (to have the latest middleware) instead of using the default one coming with the Linux distro is a good idea ?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Also does the XPMEM kernel module for more efficient intra node transfer of large message worth installing since kernels now include the CMA API ?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
