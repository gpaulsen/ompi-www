I want to compile openmpi to work with the solaris studio express  or solaris studio. This is a different version than is installed on rockscluster 5.2  and would like to know if there any gotchas or configure flags I should use to get it working or portable to nodes on the cluster. Software-wise,  it is a fairly homogeneous environment with only slight variations on the hardware side which could be isolated (machinefile flag and what-not) <br>
