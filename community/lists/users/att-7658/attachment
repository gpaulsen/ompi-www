Hi,<br><br>I am new to mpi programming and openmpi. I have installed
openmpi and run several sample programmes on single machine. But while
running on several nodes it is showing errors.<br><br>I have configured
openmpi and automated login to all nodes with user mpi. Now on master i
tried to run by &quot;mpiexec -np 4 -host n1,n2,n3,n4 a.out&quot; where n1,n2,n3
and n4 are four nodes on which i have enabled automatic login. Now I am
getting error :<br>
<br>Failed to find the following executable:<br><br>Host:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; server1.tm.local<br>Executable: a.out<br><br>Cannot continue.<br><br>Now
my problem is this should I copy this executable to all nodes ??? If
yes then how will it work, because I am not expecting any value from
user all parameters are generated in a.out itself.<br>
<br>Please help me out what is the problem here and what should i do.<br><br>Thanks in advance.<br clear="all"><br>-- <br>GAURAV GUPTA<br>B.Tech III Yr. , Department of Computer Science &amp; Engineering<br>IT BHU , Varanasi<br>
