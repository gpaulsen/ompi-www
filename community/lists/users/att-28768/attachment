<div dir="ltr"><div><div><div>Hello all<br><br></div>I don&#39;t mean this to be a political conversation, but more of a research type.<br><br></div>From what I have been observing, some of the interconnects that had very good technological features as well as popularity in the past have basically gone down the history book and some others, with comparable feature set, have gained (although I won&#39;t put any names here, neither of these are commodity gigabit Ethernet).<br><br></div>Any comments on what drives these factors? Put another way, if I am to architect a system consisting of commodity nodes today, how can I reasonably be sure that the interconnect will be a good choice, in all sense of the word &#39;good&#39;, say, 10 years down the road?<br><div><div><div><div><div><br></div><div>Thanks<br></div><div>Durga<br></div><div><br clear="all"><div><div class="gmail_signature"><div dir="ltr"><div class="gmail_signature">We learn from history that we never learn from history.<br></div></div></div></div>
