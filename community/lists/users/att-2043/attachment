<div>Very interesting, indeed! Message passing running over raw Ethernet using cheap COTS PCs is indeed the need of the hours for people like me who has a very shallow pocket. Great work! What would make this effort *really* cool is to have a one-to-one mapping of APIs from MPI domain to GAMMA domain, so, for example, existing MPI code can be ported with a trivial amount of work. Professor Ladd, how did you do this porting, 
e.g. for VASP? How much of an effort was it? (Or did the VASP guys already had a version running over GAMMA ?)</div>

<br>looked at the source and its very similar to what I do. 1) set up buffers<br>with data. 2) Start clock 3) Call MPI_xxx N times 4) Stop clock 5) calculate<br>rate. IMB tests more things than I do; I just focused on the calls I use
<br>(send recv allreduce). I have done a lot of testing of hardware and<br>software. I will have some web pages posted soon. I will put a note here<br>when I do. But a couple of things.<br>A) I have found the switch is the biggest discriminant if you want to run
<br>HPC under Gigabit ethernet. Most GigE switches choke when all the ports are<br>being used at once. This is the usual HPC pattern, but not of a typical<br>network, which is what these switches are geared towards. The one exception
<br>I have found is the Extreme Networks x450a-48t. In some test patterns I<br>found it to be 500 times faster (not a typo) than the s400-48t, which is its<br>predecessor. I have tested several GigE switches (Extreme, Force10, HP,
<br>Asante) and the x450 is the only one that copes with high traffic loads in<br>all port configurations. Its expensive for a GigE switch (~$6500) but worth<br>it in my opinion if you want to do HPC. Its still much cheaper than
<br>Infiniband.<br>B) You have to test the switch in different port configurations-a random<br>ring of SendRecv is good for this. I don't think IMB has it in its test<br>suite but its easy to program. Or you can change the order of nodes in the
<br>machinefile to force unfavorable port assignments. A step of 12 is a good<br>test since many GigE switches use 12-port ASICS and this forces all the<br>traffic onto the backplane. On the Summit 400 this causes it to more or less
<br>stop working-rates drop to a few Kbytes/sec along each wire, but the x450<br>has no problem with the same test. You need to know how your nodes are wired<br>to the switch to do this test.<br>C) GAMMA is an extraordinary accomplishment in my view; in a number of tests
<br>with codes like DLPOLY, GROMACS, VASP it can be 2-3 times the speed of TCP<br>based programs with 64 cpus. In many instances I get comparable (and<br>occasionally better) scaling than with the university HPC system which has
<br>an Infiniband interconnect. Note I am not saying GigE is comparable to IB;<br>but that a typical HPC setup with nodes scattered all over a fat tree<br>topology (including oversubscription of the links and switches) is enough of
<br>a minus that an optimized GigE set up can compete; at least up to 48 nodes<br>(96 cpus in our case). I have worked with Giuseppe Ciaccio for the past 9<br>months eradicating some obscure bugs in GAMMA. I find them; he fixes them.
<br>We have GAMMA running on 48 nodes quite reliably but there are still many<br>issues to address. GAMMA is very much a research tool-there are a number of<br>features(?) which would hinder it being used in an HPC environment.
<br>Basically Giuseppe needs help with development. Any volunteers?<br><br>Tony<br>-------------------------------<br>Tony Ladd<br>Professor, Chemical Engineering<br>University of Florida<br>PO Box 116005<br>Gainesville, FL 32611-6005
