<div>Further to the posting below, I can report that the test program (attached - this time correctly) is chewing up CPU time on both compute nodes for as long as I care to let it continue.<br>
It would appear that MPI_Receive which is the next command after the print statements in the test program.<br>
<br>
Has anyone else seen this behavior or can anyone give me a hint on how to troubleshoot.<br>
Cheers and thanks<br>

<div class="gmail_quote">Hi all<br>
<br>
We have been using OpenMPI for many years with Ubuntu on our 20-node cluster. Each node has 2 quad cores, so we usually run up to 8 processes on each node up to a maximum of 160 processes.<br>
<br>
However, we just upgraded the cluster to Ubuntu 11.04 with Open MPI 1.4.3 and and have come across a strange behavior where mpi programs run perfectly well when confined to one node but hangs during communication across multiple nodes. We have no idea why and
 would like some help in debugging this. A small MPI test program is attached and typical output shown below.<br>
<br>
Hope someone can help us<br>
Cheers and thanks<br>
