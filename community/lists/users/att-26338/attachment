<div dir="ltr">Hello,<div><br></div><div>I am new to MPI and also this list. </div><div>I wrote an MPI code with several MPI_Bcast calls in a loop. My code was getting stuck at random points, ie it was not systematic. After a few hours of debugging and googling, I found that the issue may be with the several MPI_Bcast calls in a loop. </div><div><br></div><div>I stumbled on this test code which can reproduce the issue:</div><div><a href="https://github.com/fintler/ompi/blob/master/orte/test/mpi/bcast_loop.c">https://github.com/fintler/ompi/blob/master/orte/test/mpi/bcast_loop.c</a></div><div><br></div><div>Im using OpenMPI v1.8.4 installed from official Arch Linux repo.</div><div><br></div><div>Is it a known issue with OpenMPI?</div><div>Is it some problem with the way openmpi is configured in my system? </div><div><br></div><div>Thanks in advance.</div><div><br></div><div>Sachin</div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div>
