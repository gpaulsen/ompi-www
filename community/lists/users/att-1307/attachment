Hi ,<br>  I am a newbie of openMPI.<br>  I was running LAM/MPI. I was able to buld latest version of lam 7.1.2.<br>  I am using RedHat 9(shrike). <br>  <br>  Do i need additional libraries to build openMPI? Can i just build in a simple way as in LAM/MPI?<br>  <br>  Are there any equivalents of lamboot,lamclean, wipe, lamgrow tools in openMPI?<br>  <br>  Does openMPI provide C++ support without any additional libraries(on my system) as in LAM/MPI 7.1.2?<br>  <br>  Sorry for flooding with too many questions. I actually need to make quick decision on OpenMPI. :-(<br>  <br>  Thanks in advance.!<br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  Imran<br>  <p>__________________________________________________<br>Do You Yahoo!?<br>Tired of spam?
