      <pre>I am getting the following error, amidst many successful message sends:

    I think I've tracked down the immediate cause: I was sending a very
    large object (from R--I assume serialized into a byte stream) that
    was over 3G.&nbsp; I'm not sure why it would produce that error, but it
    doesn't seem that surprising that something would go wrong.<br>

      Any ideas about what is going on or what I can do to fix it?<br>
      <br>
      I am using the openmpi-bin 1.4.2-4 Debian package on a cluster
      running Debian squeeze.<br>
      <br>
      I couldn't find a config.log file; there is
      /etc/openmpi/openmpi-mca-params.conf, which is completely
      commented out.<br>
      <br>
      Invocation is from R 3.0.1 (debian package) with Rmpi 0.6.3 built
      by me from source in a local directory. My sends all use
      mpi.isend.Robj and the receives use mpi.recv.Robj, both from the
      Rmpi library.<br>
      <br>
      The jobs were started with rmpilaunch; it and the hosts file are
      included in the attachments. TCP connections.&nbsp; rmpilaunch leaves
      me in an R session on the master.&nbsp; I invoked the code inside the
      toplevel() function toward the bottom of dbox-master.R. <br>
      <br>
      The program source files and other background information is in
      the attached file.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; n10 has the output of <code>ompi_info
        --all, and n1011 has other info for both nodes that were active
        (n10 was master; n11 had some slaves).<br>
      </code> <br>
