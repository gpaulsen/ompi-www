It&#39;s compiler specific I think.  I&#39;ve done this with OpenMPI no problem, however on one another cluster with ifort I&#39;ve gotten error messages about not using MPI_IN_PLACE.  So I think if it compiles, it should work fine.<br>

I am working with a Fortran 90 code with many MPI calls like this:<br>
<br>
call mpi_gatherv(x,nsize(rank+1),<br>
     mpi_real,x,nsize,nstep,mpi_real,root,mpi_comm_world,mstat)<br>
<br>
&#39;x&#39; is allocated on root to be large enough to hold the results of the<br>
gather, other arrays and parameters are defined correctly, and the code<br>
runs as it should.  However, I am concerned that having the same send<br>
and receive buffer on root is a violation of the MPI standard.  Am I<br>
correct?  I am aware of the MPI_IN_PLACE feature that can be used in<br>
this situation, by defining it as the send buffer at root.<br>
<br>
The fact that the code as written seems to work on most system we run on<br>
(some with OpenMPI, some with proprietary MPI&#39;s) indicates that in spite<br>
of the standard, implementations allow it.  Is this correct, or are we<br>
just lucky.<br>
