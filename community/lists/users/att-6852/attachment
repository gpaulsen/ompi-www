<div dir="ltr">I have been testing some code against openmpi lately that always causes it to crash during certain mpi function calls.&nbsp; The code does not seem to be the problem, as it runs just fine against mpich.&nbsp; I have tested it against openmpi 1.2.5, 1.2.6, and 1.2.7 and they all exhibit the same problem.&nbsp; Also, the problem only occurs in openmpi when running more than 16 processes.&nbsp; I have posted this stack trace to the list before, but I am submitting it now as a potential bug report.&nbsp; I need some help debugging it and finding out exactly what is going on in openmpi when the segfault occurs.&nbsp; Are there any suggestions on how best to do this?&nbsp; Is there an easy way to attach gdb to one of the processes or something??&nbsp; I have already compiled openmpi with debugging, memory profiling, etc.&nbsp; How can I best take advantage of these features?<br>
