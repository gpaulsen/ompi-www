People have also done the same with no problem.<br><br>Do you have access to the source code?&nbsp; I wonder if the program is&nbsp; <br>internally raising an error and effectively aborting itself.&nbsp; Do you&nbsp; <br>know that the application runs correctly?&nbsp; Do you have any test data&nbsp; <br>sets that you can try that give known outputs?<br><br>Yes, I have installed the source code. I have not been able to run the program in parallel, but I have run my inputs sequentially and got satisfactory results. <br><br>If you allow me, I can send the details of the code to your email. <br></div><div style="font-family: times new roman,new
