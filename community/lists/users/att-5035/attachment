Hi everyone,<br>
<br>
I have a problem regarding funnel-threaded OpenMPI-based applications. <br>
The application I try to launch (nothing complicated) blocks during the
execution from time to time. And I have to say this is quite a
fun-breaker :D.<br>
<br>
I will try to put this in a very simple way: I have the following code
which does nothing more than a "request" for a funneled "environment"
which, once initialized, is right away shut down:<br>
<br>
<pre wrap="">#include &lt;mpi.h&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;cassert&gt;

using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char** argv) {

        int provided = MPI_THREAD_FUNNELED;
        MPI_Init_thread ( &amp;argc, &amp;argv, MPI_THREAD_FUNNELED, &amp;provided );

        assert (provided == MPI_THREAD_FUNNELED);

        MPI_Finalize();

        return 0;
}</pre>
<br>
<br>
For the compilation, I did not specify anything special: mpicxx
example.cpp -o example<br>
When launching, in order to test, I used a loop like the following:<br>
<br>
<pre wrap="">for ((i=0;i&lt;100;i++)); do echo $i "&lt;--------- "; mpiexec -n 2 ./example; done</pre>
<br>
Now, the thing is that this usually does not go further than at most
the 30th iteration. And, of course, I get this also by launching
manually, just that it takes more time to get there ;).<br>
<br>
I would extremely appreciate if someone can give a hint on this. Is
there anything special that I should look for, is there a compilation
switch I should turn on, etc.? I get the same behavior on bi-cores,
4x-cores, different environments... I don't know if this helps but the
line I used for configuring the OpenMPI package is the following:<br>
<br>
<pre wrap="">.<i class="moz-txt-slash"><span class="moz-txt-tag">/</span>configure --prefix=/opt/globus/openmpi<span
 class="moz-txt-tag">/</span></i> --enable-mpi-cxx 
--enable-shared --enable-smp-locks  --enable-cxx-exceptions 
--enable-mpi-threads --enable-progress-threads --enable-io-romio</pre>
<br>
Thanks in advance for your time and looking forward to your answer(s)!<br>
