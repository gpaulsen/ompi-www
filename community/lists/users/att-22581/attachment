<div>Serves me right for not reading your original mail.... you have SLES 11 SP2</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The openmpi RPMs are provided by the SuSE Software Development Kit DVD.</div>
<div>you can download SIO images of this from the SUSE website.</div>
<div>For SP! it is named  SLE-SP1-SDK-DVD-x86_64-GM-DVD1.iso</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So you should copy this .iso file onto your system - the SP2 version of course.</div>
<div>Use YAST to enable it as a software repositoty, or use zypper -ar to add it as a repository</div>
<div> </div>
<div>zypper search openmpi</div>
<div>zypper install openmpi</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have bored this list enought with Suse stuff - send me an email if you cannot get the above recipe to work.</div>
