The biggest issue you may have is that gnu fortran does not support all the fortran constructs that all the others do. Most fortrans have supported the standard plus the DEC extentions. Gnu fortran does not quite get all the standards.Intel fortran does support them all, and I believe that portland group and absoft may also.<br>

Hi....<br>
<br>
I have a large program written in FORTRAN 77 with a couple of routines<br>
written in C++.  It has MPI commands built into it to run on a large scale<br>
multiprocessor IBM systems.  I am now having the task of transferring this<br>
program over to a cluster system.  Both the multiprocessor and cluster<br>
system has linux hosted on them.  The Cluster system has GNU FORTRAN and GNU<br>
C compilers on it.  I am told the Cluster has openmpi.  I am wondering if<br>
anybody out there has had to do the same task and if so what I can expect<br>
from this.  Will I be expected to make some big changes, etc.?  Any advice<br>
will be appreciated.<br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>
<br>
<br>
