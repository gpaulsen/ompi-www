Hello Everyone,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just want to add extra API to be used by application guys. This API can be called from C application and has to be compiled and linked by MPICC. But i am getting undefined references, even though i am exporting it in the source code. Could some one tell me the steps, i should be considerate about?<br /><br />-Neeraj<br />
