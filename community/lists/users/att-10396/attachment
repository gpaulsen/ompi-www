In the info object I only set the &quot;host&quot; key (after creatig the object with the MPI_Info_create).<br><br>I&#39;ve modified my code to leave out that request and created the array of Info object as an array of MPI_INFO_NULL but the problem is still the same. <br>
The error is thrown only when running with more than one process.<br><br>I tried also the previous OpenMPI version (v 1.3.2).<br><br>Do I send you a short program for testing it?<br><br>Thank you!<br>     Federico<br>
