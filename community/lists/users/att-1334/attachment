Thanks brian,<br>  I shall download alpha 8 and upgrade. I have few more questions. <br>  <br>  1)Are there simple ways to upgrade, or shall i start from scratch?<br>  <br>  <br>  2)Pls look at the following error message.<br>  <br>  P= 14 NA= 0 RF--&gt; 16<br>  P=10 RN=53<br>  P= 10 NA= 53 RF--&gt; 8<br>  <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Signal:11 info.si_errno:0(Success) si_code:196609()</span><br style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">  <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Failing at addr:0x2</span><br style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">  <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[0] func:/usr/local/openmpi/lib/libopal.so.0 [0x40178df4]</span><br style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">  <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1] func:/lib/libpthread.so.0 [0x40040e07]</span><br style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">  <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2] func:/lib/libc.so.6 [0x402c94f0]</span><br style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">  <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]

 along  with its main thread. I use THREAD_MULTIPLE option. I am registering a  function to catch SIGALRM signal in the thread. Each thread catches the  signal after some time and terminates normally. This is also as the  same problem as the previous one, sometimes error message comes, and  some times it wont. <br>  What could be the problem??<br>  <br>  3) None of the threads(even main thread) were catching SIGINT.<br>  <br>  4) Is there any way to make the threads catch signal without creating problems, as i faced above?<br>  <br>  5)Is there any tool available to wipe out all process across the nodes.? like lamclean or wipe . Anything will u suggest?<br>  <br>  Thanks and regards,<br>  <br>  Imran<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br><br><b><i>Brian Barrett &lt;brbarret@open-mpi.org&gt;</i></b> wrote:<blockquote class="replbq" style="border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255); margin-left: 5px; padding-left: 5px;">  On May 26, 2006, at 11:31 PM, imran shaik wrote:<br><br>&gt; I have
