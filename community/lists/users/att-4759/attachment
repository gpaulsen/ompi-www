Dear All,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am wondering if ORTE can be run in persistent mode. It has already been raised in Mailing list ( http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/users/2006/03/0939.php),&nbsp; where it was said that the problem is still there. I just want to know, if its fixed or being fixed ?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Reason, why i am looking at is in large clusters, mpirun takes lot of time starting orted (by ssh) on remote nodes. If orte is already running, hopefully we can save considerable time. <br />Any comments is appreciated.<br /><br /> -Neeraj<br /><br />
