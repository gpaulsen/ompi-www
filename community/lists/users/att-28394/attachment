      <pre wrap="">In case the last message came out garbled because newlines were removed, I've send it again. Anyway,I've been trying to create a derived datatype for use in one-sided communication, and I find that attempting to modify the extents to account for potential alignment issues is making things *worse*, at least when one-sided communication is used. Modifying extents seems to work fine when using the datatype for two-sided communication, however. I also find that the problem seems to occur with the version of OpenMPI on my workstation (which, unfortunately, is a prior stable release, 1.8.5), but not with Cray's MPICH. Mainly, I'm trying to figure out if there's a problem with my code that OpenMPI is catching but Cray is not, or if the problem is at OpenMPI's end. The attached test code that triggers the problem for me when compiled with "-DADJ_EXTENT".
