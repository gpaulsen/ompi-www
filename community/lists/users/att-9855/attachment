Hi,<br>I&#39;m  new to openmpi and currently I have setup openmpi-1.3.3a1r21566 on my Linux machines. I have run some of available examples and also noticed there are some test modules under /openmpi-1.3.3a1r21566/test. Are these tests run on batchwise? then how ? or are these tests suppose to run individually by compiling and executing seperately ? <br>
I&#39;m hoping to contribute openmpi as a developer, so I would like to know can users contribute by adding more example codes ? <br><br>Thanks,<br>Prasad.<br clear="all"><br>-- <br><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/script/Articles/MemberArticles.aspx?amid=3489381">http://www.codeproject.com/script/Articles/MemberArticles.aspx?amid=3489381</a><br>
