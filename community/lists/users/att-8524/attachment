Hello,<div><br></div><div>I am running DL_POLY in various Xserver 8 processor with a myrinet network.using mx-1.2.7</div><div><br></div><div>While I keep in the same node the process scales reasonably well but in the moment I hit the network ...</div>
<div><br></div><div>I will like to try to maximize  the mx network before trying to touch the program code.</div><div><br></div><div>Is there some place where I can check what the mca params really means?</div><div>Can anyone give me a hint where it would be better to look to optimize OMPI1.3 for macosx?</div>
<div><br></div><div>Thanks</div><div><br></div><div>Ricardo</div>
