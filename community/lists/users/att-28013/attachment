Harald,<br>
<br>
the answer is in ompi/mca/coll/libnbc/nbc_ibcast.c<br>
<br>
this has been revamped (but not 100%) in v2.x<br>
(e.g. no more calls to MPI_Comm_{size,rank} but MPI_Type_size is still<br>
being invoked)<br>

Ah! it is interesting to know this pointer, thanks. Looks like others such as igather and ireduce also have this issue :S<br>

I will review this.<br>
basically, no MPI_* should be invoked internally (e.g. we should use the<br>
internal ompi_* or the PMPI_* symbol.<br>
<br>
there is currently no plan for a v1.10.2 release, so you have to wait<br>
for the v2.0.0)<br>

Is it possible to know when this behavior was introduced? Maybe since the first MPI3 implementation (was it OpenMPI 1.8?).<br>

note you should wrap the C bindings (with a C library) and the Fortran<br>
bindings (with a Fortran library).<br>
currently, the fortran wrapper will likely invoke the C wrapper, but<br>
that will no more be the case from v2.x<br>

Oh! That&#39;s a pity. We usually use the LD_PRELOAD technique to inject the instrumentation and since fortran wrapper invokes the C wrapper, we can instrument either fortran or C applications with a single instrumentation library. Other MPI implementations (I won&#39;t say names here) also have this C/Fortran &quot;separation&quot;, which requires us to generate two instrumentation libraries, one for C and another for Fortran apps.<br>
<br>
Thank you!<br>

    Dear all,<br>
<br>
       we develop an instrumentation package based on PMPI and we&#39;ve<br>
    observed that PMPI_Ibarrier and PMPI_Ibcast invoke regular<br>
    MPI_Comm_size and MPI_Comm_rank instead to the PMPI symbols (i.e.<br>
    PMPI_Comm_size and PMPI_Comm_rank) in OpenMPI 1.10.0.<br>
<br>
       I have attached simple example that demonstrates it when using<br>
    OpenMPI 1.10.0. The example creates a library (libinstrument) that<br>
    hooks MPI_Comm_size, MPI_Comm_rank and MPI_Ibarrier. Then, there&#39;s a<br>
    single MPI application that executes MPI_Ibarrier and waits for it.<br>
    The result when combining this binary with the instrumentation<br>
    library is the following:<br>
<br>
    # ~/aplic/openmpi/1.10.0/bin/mpirun -np 1 ./main<br>
    entering MPI_Ibarrier<br>
    entering MPI_Comm_rank<br>
    leaving MPI_Comm_rank<br>
    entering MPI_Comm_size<br>
    leaving MPI_Comm_size<br>
    leaving MPI_Ibarrier<br>
<br>
       which shows that MPI_Comm_rank and MPI_Comm_size are invoked<br>
    within MPI_Ibarrier.<br>
<br>
       I looked into ompi/mpi/ibarrier.c and<br>
    ./ompi/mpi/c/profile/pibarrier.c but it wasn&#39;t evident to me what<br>
    might be wrong.<br>
<br>
       Can anyone check this? And if this could also occur to other MPI3<br>
    immediate collectives (MPI_Ireduce, MPI_Iallreduce, MPI_Igather, ...).<br>
<br>
    Thank you!<br>
<br>
