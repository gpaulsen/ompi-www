    There have been many postings about openmpi-default-hostfile on the
    list, but I haven't found one that answers my question, so I hope
    you won't mind one more.<br>
    <br>
    When I use mpirun, openmpi-default-hostfile does not appear to get
    used. I've added three lines to the default host file:<br>
    <blockquote>node0 slots=3<br>
      node1 slots=4<br>
      node2 slots=4<br>
    </blockquote>
    'node0' is the local (master) host.<br>
    <br>
    If I explicitly list the hostfile in the mpirun command, everything
    works correctly.&nbsp; E.g.<br>
    <blockquote>mpirun -np 15 -hostfile
      /full/path/to/openmpi-default-hostfile hello_c<br>
    </blockquote>
    works correctly - hello_c gets run using all three nodes.<br>
    <br>
    However, if I don't specify the hostfile, only the local node,
    node0, is used. E.g.<br>
    <blockquote>mpirun -np 15 hello_c<br>
    </blockquote>
    creates all 15 processes on node0.&nbsp; I was under the impression that
    all machines listed in openmpi-default-hostfile should get used by
    default.&nbsp; Is that correct?<br>
    <br>
    Unfortunately I can't use the hostfile command line option.&nbsp; I'm
    going to be using a mpi app (npRmpi) that doesn't let me pass params
    to mpirun. So I need all my nodes used by default.<br>
    <br>
    Configuration details:<br>
    <blockquote>openmpi 1.4.3, built from source.<br>
      <br>
      OS: Debian lenny (but the Debian openmpi package is NOT
      installed).<br>
      <br>
      Installation dir: /home/omu/openmpi<br>
      <br>
      The default host file has pathname
      /home/omu/openmpi/etc/openmpi-default-hostfile<br>
      <br>
      I've set two envirnmental variables to support open mpi:<br>
      <blockquote>PATH=/home/omu/openmpi/bin:...<br>
        LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/omu/openmpi/lib:...<br>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <br>
    Are there any other environmental variables that need to be set?<br>
    <br>
    I'd appreciate any suggestions about this.<br>
    <br>
    thanks,<br>
