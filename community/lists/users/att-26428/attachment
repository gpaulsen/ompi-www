<div dir="ltr"><div><div><div><div>hi all,<br><br></div>I have openmpi 1.8.4 installed on a Mac latop.<br><br></div>When running a mpi job on localhost for testing, I&#39;ve noticed that when -np is odd number 3, 5 etc, it sometimes ran into a situation where only rank 0 is progressing, and the rest of ranks doesn&#39;t seem get to run at all ... I&#39;ve examine the code many times over and couldn&#39;t see why. I am wondering if this is something else and has anyone else run into similar problem before?<br><br></div>TIA<br><br></div>Oliver <br></div>
