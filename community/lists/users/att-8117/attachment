Query in MPI :&nbsp;&nbsp; What mpi_gather does is take the data being sent by the i th process and places it in i th location in the receive buffer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Say, I need to place the sent data in&nbsp; i*10 th location in the receive buffer?&nbsp; Is this possible at all or I have to use sent and recv ?<br>
