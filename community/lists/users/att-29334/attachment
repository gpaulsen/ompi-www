    <p>Thanks for the report.</p>
    <p>the romio included in the v1.10 series is a bit old and did not
      include the fix,</p>
    <p>i made PR #1206 for that

    <p>feel free to manually apply the patch available at
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi-release/commit/a0ea9fb6cbe4cf71567c9fc7fd8f4be384617ad4.diff">https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi-release/commit/a0ea9fb6cbe4cf71567c9fc7fd8f4be384617ad4.diff</a></p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>note that the issue is already fixed in romio of the v2.x series
      and master.</p>
    <p>that being said, the default io module here is ompio, and it is
      currently buggy, so if you are using these series, you need to</p>
    <p>mpirun --mca io romio314 ...</p>
    <p>for the time being<br>

      I recently upgraded my distribution-supplied OpenMPI packages
      (debian) from 1.6.5 to 1.10.2 and the attached test is no longer
      guaranteed to produce the expected output.
      <br>
      In plain English what the test is doing is:
      <br>
      1) open a file in parallel (all on the same local ext3/4
      filesystem),
      <br>
      2) use MPI_File_write_at() or MPI_File_write_shared() to write to
      it,
      <br>
      3) close the file using MPI_File_close(),
      <br>
      4) then check the file size (either by stat(), or by fseek+ftell)
      <br>
      <br>
      My reading of the standard is that MPI_File_close() is a
      collective operation so I should reliably get the correct file
      size in step 4. However, while this worked with version 1.6.5 and
      with Intel MPI this is no longer the case with the current OpenMPI
      version.
      <br>
      I was able to confirm the same behaviour on a fresh Ubuntu 16.0.4
      install in a VM.
      <br>
      The more ranks I use the more likely I get a wrong file size.
      <br>
      <br>
      Is there anything I'm missing or is this a regression?
      <br>
      <br>
      Thanks,
      <br>
      Cihan
