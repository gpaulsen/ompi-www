Hello,<br><br>I have the following problem. There areI two arrays somewere in the program:<br><br>double weights [MAX_SIZE];<br>...<br>int&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; values [MAX_SIZE];<br>...<br><br>I need to be able to send a single pair { weights [i], values [i] } with a single MPI_Send call Or receive it directly into both arrays at at given index i. How can I define a datatype that spans this pair over both arrays? 
<br><br>The only additional constraint it the fact that the memory location of both arrays is fixed and cannot be changed and I should avoid extra copies.<br><br>Is it possible? <br><br>Any help welcome,<br>Oleg Morajko<br>
<br><br>
