<p>I agree what Ralph says.</p>
<p>I have a lot of experience in running SLES 10 and 11 systems and many flavours of Opensuse.</p>
<p>I am not sure if rpms for Openmpi are available for Sles - I will check.</p>
<p>Installing Openfoam is a pig I agree.</p>
<p>You could be better off with Opensuse from a point of view of Openmpi and gcc versions.</p>
