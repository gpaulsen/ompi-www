Hi, <br><br>I am not sure it&#39;s a bug but I think we wait for something else when we kill a proccess - by the way , the signal propagation works well. <br>I read an explanation on a previous thread - ( <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/users/2009/03/8514.php">http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/users/2009/03/8514.php</a> ) . . <br>
<br>It&#39;s not important but it could contribute to make openmpi better !!<br><br>Geoffroy<br>
