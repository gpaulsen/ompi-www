<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); ">Hi,<div><br></div><div>I was just wondering what does &quot;progress: no&quot; signify when I check the level of thread support using ompi_info for the OpenMPI installation I have. </div>
<div><br></div><div>Also, I guess &quot;mpi: no&quot; for thread support signify that multiple threads in my MPI program will not work as expected if they have MPI communication. So, different threads of multiple processes using MPI_Send() and MPI_Recv() would behave normally only if the installed MPI library provides MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE level thread support.</div>
