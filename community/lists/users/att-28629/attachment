<html><head></head><body><div>Hi all,</div><div>I have built OpenMPI 1.10.2 with RoCE network support on our test cluster. On the cluster we use lmod to manage paths to different versions of softwares. The problem I have is that I receive the "orted: command not found" message given that the path to the orted binary is not exported to the other nodes where my run is launched via a non-interactive ssh connection. I temporarily solved the problem by exporting PATH with the correct path to orted on my .bashrc file but this is not obviously a solution.</div><div>Any idea how I can fix it?</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you.</div><div><br></div><div>Davide</div></body></html>
