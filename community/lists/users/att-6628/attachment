&gt; I believe that the problem is your "-DMPI" in your Makefile. 
The line
&gt;
&gt; in question in mpicxx.h is:
&gt;
&gt; namespace MPI {
&gt;
&gt; When you use -DMPI, the preprocessor replaces this with:
&gt;
&gt; namespace 1 {
&gt;
&gt; which is not legal.
&gt;
&gt; In short, the application using the name "MPI" is illegal.  That
name
&gt;
&gt; is reserved for the MPI C++ namespace.  If you change the name to
&gt; something else (like -DUSE_MPI, and change the source code to match),
&gt; this particular problem should be solved.
&gt;
&gt; But then again, I'm not sure why you changed CPP to g++ and CC to gcc;
&gt; shouldn't they be mpicc?
&gt;
&gt; It's also not clear from the context of Makefile.common whether CPP is
&gt; supposed to be the C preprocessor or the C++ compiler.  If it's
&gt; supposed to be the C preprocessor, then "mpicc -E" would be
fine; if
&gt;
&gt; it's supposed to be the C++ compiler, then mpic++ (or mpiCC) would be
&gt; fine.

&gt; &gt; Thanks a lot. The problem i have is that i have installed
&gt; &gt; openmpi-1.2.7 and every thing went well and i tested hello_c and
&gt; &gt; ring_c. But the problem now is that when i use open mpi's mpicc
and
&gt; &gt; mpic++ in my Makefile i get errors reported from inside openmpi's
&gt; &gt; source code. I am attaching my Makefile and here I paste a snapshot
