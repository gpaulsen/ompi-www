Hi All,<br><br>I am trying to compile OpenMPI 1.4 with PGI 9.0-3 and am getting the following error in configure:<br><br>checking for functional offsetof macro... no<br>configure: WARNING: Your compiler does not support offsetof macro<br>
configure: error: Configure: Cannot continue<br><br>I have searched around and found that this error occurs because of a problem in the configure scripts when PGI 10 is used, but I&#39;m using 9.0-3 which should not have the configure script issue. Here is the output of pgcc -V:<br>
<br>pgcc 9.0-3 64-bit target on x86-64 Linux -tp k8-64e <br>Copyright 1989-2000, The Portland Group, Inc.  All Rights Reserved.<br>Copyright 2000-2009, STMicroelectronics, Inc.  All Rights Reserved.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s wrong here as other people have reported being able to build OpenMPI with PGI 9. Does anyone have any ideas?<br>
<br>Thanks,<br>Tim Miller<br>
