<div dir="ltr"><div>All,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I had a similar problem as James described in an earlier message: <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/users/2008/07/6204.php">http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/users/2008/07/6204.php</a></div>
<div>While he was able to recompile openmpi to solve the problem, I had no luck with my RedHat Enterprise 5 system.</div>
<div>Here&nbsp;are two other threads with similar issues regarding openmpi on Ubuntu and OSX which were solved: <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/binutils/+bug/234837">https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/binutils/+bug/234837</a></div>

<div>Now...</div>
<div>Here is my story:</div>
<div>I had Quantum Espresso (QE) running without problem using openmpi.</div>
<div>However, when I tried to recompile QE with&nbsp;a recompiled&nbsp;fftw-2.1.5, it compiled without any error. But when I ran QE, it gave me the error below:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>*** Process received signal ***<br>Signal: Segmentation fault (11)</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>From what I read from the above links, it seems to be a bug in openmpi.</div>
<div>Please share your thoughts on this, thank you!</div>
