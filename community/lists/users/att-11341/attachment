&gt; After reading Anthony's question again, I am not sure now that we are having<br>
&gt; the same problem, but we might. In any case, the attached example programs<br>
&gt; trigger the issue of running out of pipes. I don't see how orted could, even<br>
&gt; if it was reused. There is only a very limited number of processes running<br>
&gt; at any given time. Once slave terminates, how would it still have open<br>
&gt; pipes? Shouldn't the total number of open files, or pipes, be very limited<br>
&gt; in this situation? And yet, after maybe 20 or so iterations in master.c,<br>
&gt; orted complains about running out of pipes.<br>

</div>What version of OMPI are you trying it with? I can easily run it up to more<br>
than 200 iterations.<br>

Also, how many nodes are you running this on?<br>
