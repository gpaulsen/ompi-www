Hi, <div>   I&#39;m currently doing MPI project in NUS University. My professor require me make a monitoring tool to check the connection among processes in Cluster. And also measure communication round-trip time. </div><div>
   My solution is : </div><div>1. At the source process : start MPI_Send </div><div>2. At the destination process : start MPI_Recv to receive the message from source</div><div>3. At the destination process : start MPI_Send to send immediately the same message to source </div>
<div>4. At the source process : start MPI_Recv to receive the message from destination </div><div>   I start timer( before (1) - t1=MPI_Wtime &amp; after (4) - t2=MPI_Wtime ) </div><div>   then t2 - t1 is time for communication. I also do (1) to (4) for N times. then i calculate the avg round-trip time by (t2-t1)/N. </div>
<div>   So is it right? Because he tells it &#39;s wrong. And what exactly is the communication round-trip time ? </div><div>  Regards and hope to see your reply soon. </div>
