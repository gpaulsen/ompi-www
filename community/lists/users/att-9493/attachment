Hi,<br><br>       I am just getting my feet wet with openmpi and can&#39;t
seem to get it running. I installed openmpi and all it&#39;s components via
yum and am able compile and run programs with mpi locally but not
across the two computers. I set up the keyed ssh on both mechines and
am able to log into another without asking for a password. From reading
online it looks like my problem may stem from an unconfigured
.bash_profile as I don&#39;t think yum would have configured it for me. My
question is where does yum stick the bin and lib files that I need to
reference in my profile? What should my bash_profile look like? Thank
you for reading and am eagerly awaiting your reply.<br>
