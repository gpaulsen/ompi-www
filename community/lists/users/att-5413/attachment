<div>Hi.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Anyone had performed Gromacs(v3.x - v3.3.3) with FFTW(v3.1)&nbsp;debugging using OpenMPI(v-1.2.5 or v-1.2.6). I had properly configured OpenMPI with debug option and also configured Gromacs alongwith FFTW succesfully. I can perform p2bdbx_mpi, editconf_mpi, genbox_mpi, grompp_mpi compilation and finally mdrun_mpi without any error or warning messages. But while executing mdrun_mpi w.r.t mprun, I get libmpi.so.0 not found. </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I had&nbsp;tried with&nbsp;LD_LIBRARY_PATH, forcefully mentioning PATH &amp; LD_LIBRARY_PATH in etc/bashrc file and also tried with providing softlink to libmpi.so.0, but everytime I get same error message of &quot;libmpi.so.0&quot; not found.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I had check ldd and it&#39;s dependency of executable mdrun_mpi, checked it&#39;s symbol table content, and finally all lib&#39;s configured for 64 bit with ELF format but still getting same error of libmpi.so.0 not found while performing GDB serial debugging with single node.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Note: I had&nbsp;performed GDB debugging for&nbsp;small MPI program(hello world)&nbsp;using OpenMPI(v1.2.5/v1.2.6) wthout GROMACS association succesfully.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Any clue plz?</div>
