    I just tried it on a clean VM, the 64-bit OpenMPI installer does
    install to Program Files (x86).&nbsp; That's not the end of the world,
    but you have to watch your paths.<br>
    <br>
    Miroslav, when you ran the installer did you say yes to adding
    OpenMPI to the system path?&nbsp; If you installed both 32 and 64-bit
    binaries, and added both to the system path, it will typically just
    append the paths.&nbsp; So if you installed 32-bit first, then 64-bit,
    whenever you run something it will load the 32-bit OpenMPI runtime
    first, even running 64-bit, which will cause that bad image error.&nbsp;
    I think that's why your 32-bit run works and 64-bit doesn't.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    I suggest uninstalling both 32 and 64-bit OpenMPIs, make sure
    they're removed from the path, then reinstall them *without* putting
    them into the system path, and try again from there.&nbsp; You'll have to
    set your paths manually, but you'll be running with the right
    binaries each time.<br>

      <pre wrap="">Hi,

0xC000007B is STATUS_INVALID_IMAGE_FORMAT. It mostly means that some of the
dynamic link libraries (DLLs) that the executable is linked against are of
different "bitness", e.g. 32-bit. It could be a packaging error in Open MPI,
or it could be messed up installation. You could use the Dependency Walker
tool to examine the list of DLLs that the executable depends upon and see
which one is the culprit. Dependency Walker is available here:

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.dependencywalker.com/">http://www.dependencywalker.com/</a>

Which brings me to the question: why the win64 version of Open MPI is
installed in "Program Files (x86)", where 32-bit things go?!

Hope that helps.

Kind regards,
Hristo

Dear experts,

I just installed <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.open">http://www.open</a>-
mpi.org/software/ompi/v1.6/downloads/OpenMPI_v1.6.1-1_win64.exe on
our Intel i7 64-bit Windows 7 system.


When I try to run  some executable, I am getting error "Application Error

Any help please ? The "C:\Program Files (x86)\OpenMPI_v1.6.1-x64\bin"
string is in my %Path% variable.

Yours, Miro

PS: On 32-bit Windows 7 the 32-bit OpenMPI application works fine.
