    Hello,<br>
    <br>
    Is it possible to use a single build of Open MPI against multiple
    versions of GCC if the versions of GCC are from the same release
    series? I was under the assumption that as long as a
    binary-compatible compiler was used, it was possible to "swap out"
    the compiler from underneath Open MPI.<br>
    <br>
    That is the general question I have, but here is the specific
    scenario that prompted it:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>built Open MPI 1.10.1 against GCC 5.2.0 with a directory name
        of openmpi-1.10.1-gcc-5<br>
      </li>
      <li>installed GCC 5.3.0</li>
      <li>removed GCC 5.2.0</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I now have users who are getting errors like the following when
      using mpicxx:<br>
    </p>
    <p>/bin/grep:
      /usr/projects/hpcsoft/toss2/common/gcc/5.2.0/lib/../lib64/libstdc++.la:
      No such file or directory<br>
    </p>
    <p>I can see several references to my previous GCC 5.2.0
      installation in the &lt;install dir&gt;/lib/*.la files, including
      a reference to
      /usr/projects/hpcsoft/toss2/common/gcc/5.2.0/lib/../lib64/libstdc++.la.<br>
    </p>
    <p>This is all disconcerting as users of GCC 5.3.0 were using
      5.3.0's binaries but were getting some 5.2.0 library configs
      before I removed 5.2.0, but no one knew it.<br>
    </p>
    <p>If it should be possible to use a single build of Open MPI with
      multiple binary-compatible compilers, is there a way to fix my
      above situation or prevent it from happening at build time?<br>
    </p>
    <p>Thanks,<br>
      David<br>
