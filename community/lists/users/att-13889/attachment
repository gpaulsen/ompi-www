I believe it is definitely a no-no to STORE (write) into a send buffer
while a send is posted.&nbsp; I know there have been debate in the forum to
relax LOADS (reads) from a send buffer.&nbsp; I think OMPI can handle the
latter case (LOADS).&nbsp; On the posted receive side you open yourself up
for some race conditions and overwrites if you do STORES or LOADS from
a posted receive buffer.<br>

  <br>
I have a problem with a fortran code that I have parallelized with MPI.
I state in advance that I read the whole ebook "Mit Press - Mpi - The
Complete Reference, Volume 1" and I took different MPI classes, so I
have a discrete MPI knowledge. I was able to solve by myself all the
errors I bumped into but now I am not able to find the bug of my code
that provides erroneous results. Without entering in the details of my
code, I think that the cause of the problem could be reletad to the
following aspect highlighted in the above ebook (in the follow I copy
and paste from the e-book):
  <br>
  <br>
A nonblocking post-send call indicates that the system may start
copying data
  <br>
out of the send buffer. The sender must not access any part of the send
buffer
  <br>
(neither for loads nor for STORES) after a nonblocking send operation
is posted until
  <br>
the complete send returns.
  <br>
A nonblocking post-receive indicates that the system may start writing
data into
  <br>
the receive buffer. The receiver must not access any part of the
receive buffer after
  <br>
a nonblocking receive operation is posted, until the complete-receive
returns.
  <br>
Rationale. We prohibit read accesses to a send buffer while it is being
used, even
  <br>
though the send operation is not supposed to alter the content of this
buffer. This
  <br>
may seem more stringent than necessary, but the additional restriction
causes little
  <br>
loss of functionality and allows better performance on some systems-
consider
  <br>
the case where data transfer is done by a DMA engine that is not
cache-coherent
  <br>
with the main processor.End of rationale.
  <br>
  <br>
I use plenty of nonblocking post-send in my code. Is it really true
that the sender must not access any part of the send buffer not even
for STORES?&nbsp; Or was it a MPI 1.0 issue?
  <br>
Thanks.
  <br>
