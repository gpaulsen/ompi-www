<br>
</p><p>More guesses/questions than anything else:
<br>
</p><p>1) Is there any additional load on this machine?
<br>
We had problems like that (on different machines) when
<br>
users start listening to streaming video, doing Matlab calculations,
<br>
etc, while the MPI programs are running.
<br>
This tends to oversubscribe the cores, and may lead to crashes.
<br>
</p><p>2) RAM:
<br>
Can you monitor the RAM usage through "top"?
<br>
(I presume you are on Linux.)
<br>
It may show unexpected memory leaks, if they exist.
<br>
</p><p>On "top", type "1" (one) see all cores, type "f" then "j"
<br>
to see the core number associated to each process.
<br>
</p><p>3) Do the programs work right with other MPI flavors (e.g. MPICH2)?
<br>
If not, then it is not OpenMPI's fault.
<br>
</p><p>4) Any possibility that the MPI versions/flavors of mpicc and
<br>
mpirun that you are using to compile and launch the program are not the
<br>
same?
<br>
</p><p>5) Are you setting processor affinity on mpiexec?
<br>
</p><p>mpiexec -mca mpi_paffinity_alone 1 -np  ... bla, bla ...
<br>
</p><p>Context switching across the cores may also cause trouble, I suppose.
<br>
</p><p>6) Which Linux are you using (uname -a)?
<br>
</p><p>On other mailing lists I read reports that only quite recent kernels
<br>
support all the Intel Nehalem processor features well.
<br>
I don't have Nehalem, I can't help here,
<br>
but the information may be useful
<br>
for other list subscribers to help you.
<br>
</p><p>***
<br>
</p><p>As for the programs, some programs require specific setup,
<br>
(and even specific compilation) when the number of MPI processes
<br>
vary.
<br>
It may help if you tell us a link to the program sites.
<br>
</p><p>Baysian statistics is not totally out of our business,
<br>
but phylogenetic genetic trees is not really my league,
<br>
hence forgive me any bad guesses, please,
<br>
but would it need specific compilation or a different
<br>
set of input parameters to run correctly on a different
<br>
number of processors?
<br>
Do the programs mix MPI (message passing) with OpenMP (threads)?
<br>
</p><p>I found this MrBayes, which seems to do the above:

<br>
</p><p>As for the ABySS, what is it, where can it be found?
<br>
Doesn't look like a deep ocean circulation model, as the name suggest.
