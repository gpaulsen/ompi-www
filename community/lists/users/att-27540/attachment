<div style="direction: ltr;font-family: Tahoma;color: #000000;font-size: 10pt;">Our issues with OpenMPI 1.8.7 and Son-of-Gridengine turned out to be down to using the wrong Parallel Environment. Having a PE with control_slaves set to TRUE and start_proc_args
 and stop_proc_args set to NONE cleared up all our issues, at least for my MPI test code.<br>
<br>
Qsort_args was left set to NONE, which directly contradicts the FAQ for running OpenMPI through Son-of-Gridengine so maybe the OpenMPI FAQ WRT SOGE should be revised. Qsort_args is an API that involves writing your own function in a dynamically shared object
 that determines what nodes should be used to schedule a job.<br>

<div>basically, without --hetero-nodes, ompi assumes all nodes have the same topology (fast startup)
<div>with --hetero-nodes, ompi does not assume anything and request node topology (slower startup)</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>I am nor sure if this is still 100% true on all versions.</div>
<div>iirc, at least on master, a hwloc signature is checked and ompi transparently fall back to --heyero-nodes if needed</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>bottom line, on a heterogeneous cluster, it is required or safer to use the --hetero-nodes option</div>
<div><br>

&gt; I can successfully run my OpenMPI 1.8.7 jobs outside of Son-of-Gridengine but not via qrsh. We're<br>
&gt; using CentOS 6.3 and a heterogeneous cluster of hyperthreaded and non-hyperthreaded blades<br>
&gt; and x3550 chassis. OpenMPI 1.8.7 has been built w/the debug switch as well.<br>
<br>
I think you want to explain exactly why you need this world of pain.&nbsp; It<br>
seems unlikely that MPI programs will run efficiently in it.&nbsp; Our Intel<br>
nodes mostly have hyperthreading on in BIOS -- or what passes for BIOS<br>
on them -- but disabled at startup, and we only run MPI across identical<br>
nodes in the heterogeneous system.<br>
<br>
&gt; Here's my latest errors:<br>
&gt; qrsh -V -now yes -pe mpi 209 mpirun -np 209 -display-devel-map --prefix /hpc/apps/mpi/openmpi/1.8.7/ --mca btl ^sm --hetero-nodes --bind-to core /hpc/home/lanew/mpi/openmpi/ProcessColors3<br>
<br>
[What does --hetero-nodes do?&nbsp; It's undocumented as far as I can tell.]<br>
<br>
&gt; error: executing task of job 211298 failed: execution daemon on host &quot;csclprd3-0-4&quot; didn't accept task<br>
&gt; error: executing task of job 211298 failed: execution daemon on host &quot;csclprd3-4-1&quot; didn't accept task<br>
<br>
So you need to find out why that was (probably lack of slots on the exec<br>
host, which might be explained in the execd messages).<br>
<br>
&gt; [...]<br>
<br>
&gt; NOTE: the hosts that &quot;didn't accept task&quot; were different in two different runs but the errors were the same.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Here's the definition of the mpi Parallel Environment on our Son-of-Gridengine cluster:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; pe_name&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mpi<br>
&gt; slots&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9999<br>
&gt; user_lists&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;NONE<br>
&gt; xuser_lists&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; NONE<br>
&gt; start_proc_args&nbsp; &nbsp; /opt/sge/mpi/startmpi.sh $pe_hostfile<br>
&gt; stop_proc_args&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;/opt/sge/mpi/stopmpi.sh<br>
<br>
Why are those two not NONE?<br>
<br>
&gt; allocation_rule&nbsp; &nbsp; $fill_up<br>
<br>
As I said, that doesn't seem wise (unless you use -l exclusive).<br>
<br>
&gt; control_slaves&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;FALSE<br>
&gt; job_is_first_task&nbsp; TRUE<br>
&gt; urgency_slots&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; min<br>
&gt; accounting_summary TRUE<br>
&gt; qsort_args&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;NONE<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Qsort_args is set to NONE, but it's supposed to be set to TRUE right?<br>
<br>
No see sge_pe(5).&nbsp; (I think the text I supplied for the FAQ is accurate,<br>
but reuti might confirm if he's reading this.)<br>
<br>
&gt; -Bill L.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; If I can run my OpenMPI 1.8.7 jobs outside of Son-of-Gridengine w/no issues it has to be Son-of-Gridengine that's<br>
&gt; the issue right?<br>
<br>
I don't see any evidence of an SGE bug, if that's what you mean, but<br>
clearly you have a problem if execds won't accept the jobs, and this<br>
isn't the place to discuss it.&nbsp; I asked about SGE core binding, and it's<br>
presumably also relevant how slots are defined on the compute nodes, but<br>
I'd just say &quot;Don't do that&quot; without a pressing reason.<br>
