I'am writing a small program where the process of rank 0 sends "alo
alo" to the process of rank 1 and then process 1 will show this message on
screen. I am using boost++ library but result stays the same when I use the MPI standard.<br>
The program work locally ( that means: mpirun --host localhost), on the distant machine (mpirun --host name_of_distant_machine) but not on both ( mpirun --host localhost, name_of_distant_machine). There is no error message so i don't have any idea to resolve this.<br>The machine I am running is a virtual one, and the distant machine too.<br>Thank you in advance!<br><br>Son.<br><br>Nguyen Kim Son.<br>Antibes, France<br><div>Tel: +336 48 28 37 47<br></div></td></tr></table><br>
