Suppose if I want to capture any packets for my openmpi program, if I can&#39;t filter packets by ports, then how can the sniffer tell which packets are from/to any processes of my penmpi program?<br><br><div><span class="gmail_quote">

Open MPI uses TCP, and does not use any fixed ports. We use whatever ports the<br>operating system gives us. At this time there is no way to specify what ports<br>to use.<br><br>Hope this helps,<br><br>Tim<br><br>On Friday 18 May 2007 05:19 am, Code Master wrote:
