Hi Ralph,<br><br> To add few more points to my queries, as you said earlier &quot;addhost&quot; and &quot;addhostfile&quot; features will come soon. So can you please tell how we are going to use those features, will there be any API for that to calll from inside the program or we have to execute command to use those features.<br>
<br>Thanks,<br><br>Regards,<br><div class="gmail_quote">On Thu, Jul 2, 2009 at 12:46 PM, vipin kumar <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:vipinkumar41@gmail.com">vipinkumar41@gmail.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;">
Hi Ralph,<br><br>I am thankful to your reply regarding the matter, however to carry forward with my activities it would be of great help if I can know where OpenMpi/mpirun holds the contents of &quot;hostfile&quot; so that I can dynamically add/alter the values till such a feature is officially included in OpenMpi in the form of &quot;addhost&quot; and &quot;addhostfile&quot;.<br>

<br>Thanks.<br><br>Regards,<div><div></div><div class="h5"><br><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Thu, Jul 2, 2009 at 12:23 PM, Ralph Castain <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:rhc@open-mpi.org" target="_blank">rhc@open-mpi.org</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br>

<div>At the moment, the answer is &quot;no&quot;. :-/<div><br></div><div>However, we do have a &quot;ticket&quot; in our plans to add a &quot;addhost&quot; and &quot;addhostfile&quot; capability to the system. I haven&#39;t implemented it yet because of other priorities and the fact that nobody has asked for it before now.</div>

<div><br></div><div>Well...actually, people -did- ask for it a long time ago, but not for quite awhile now. ;-)</div><div><br></div><div>Anyway, I can implement those features pretty easily. Could get to it in the next few days - otherwise, it will have to wait another week as I will be out.</div>

<div><br></div><div>Either way, though, it would only be in the OMPI devel trunk until the next feature series (1.5) has its first release. Haven&#39;t set the date for that, though it will likely be this summer.</div><div>
