<div dir="ltr">Hello, <div>I have a simple program, where one node is supposed to send 3 * 10^5</div><div>4 byte messages to the other node. Sending is done using MPI_Send, receiving is done</div><div>using MPI_Recv. The problem which arises while running this program on two machines is</div>
<div>that the sending node is using a lot of memory i.e. &gt;= 19 Gb virtual memory, and ~1.5 Gb resident memory. When running two processes on one machine, memory usage is a lot smaller.</div><div><br></div><div>I tried also a scenario with sending, fewer messages (like 100), which contain more payload (so that the total data send is identical) and memory usage was normal.</div>
<div><br></div><div>I am using OpenMPI 1.6.5.</div><div>Probably I am doing something wrong, could You try to help me?</div><div>(attached the requested outputs of ompi_info)</div><div>Thanks,</div><div>Maciek.</div><div>
