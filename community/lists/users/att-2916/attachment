Hi everybody,<br><br>I am trying to install open mpi on a Mac Os XServer, and the make all command exits with the error<br><br>openmpi_install_failed.tar.gz<br><br>as you can see from the output files I attached.<br><br>Some comments that may be helpful:
<br><br>1) I am not root on the machine, but I have permissions to write in /usr/local/applications/, which is the directory in which I want to install openmpi.<br><br>2) In the same directory there is already an openmpi 
1.1.2 installation, with gcc-4.0.1 compilers. I want to install the current version of openmpi<br>and use a different compiler, namely the gcc compilers optimised for apple intel. They reside in the folder /usr/local/bin, and I pass them in the make command, as you can see from the attached file.
<br><br>Any idea as to why I receive that error?<br><br>Thanks a lot in advance<br><br>Daniele<br>
