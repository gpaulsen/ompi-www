or any link which helps to understand system reuirement for certain test scenario ..<br /><br />On Apr 23, 2009 12:42pm, viral.vkm@gmail.com wrote:<br />&gt; Hi <br />&gt; Thanks for your response. <br />&gt; However, I am running <br />&gt; mpiexec  .... -ppn 24 -n 192 /opt/IMB-MPI1 alltaoll -msglen /root/temp <br />&gt; <br />&gt; And file /root/temp contains entry upto 65535 size only. That means alltoall test will run upto 65K size only<br />&gt; <br />&gt; So, in that case I will require very less memory but then in that case also test is running out-of-memory. Please help someone to understand the scenario.<br />&gt; Or do I need to switch to some algorithm or do I need to set some other environment variables ? or anything like that ?<br />&gt; <br />&gt; On Apr 22, 2009 6:43pm, Ashley Pittman ashley@pittman.co.uk&gt; wrote:<br />&gt; &gt; On Wed, 2009-04-22 at 12:40 +0530, vkm wrote:<br />&gt; &gt; <br />&gt; &gt; <br />&gt; &gt; <br />&gt; &gt; &gt; The same amount of memory required for recvbuf.
