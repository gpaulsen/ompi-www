Hello Guys,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had openmpi v1.2 installed on my cluster. Couple of days back, i thought to upgrade it to v1.2.4(latest release i suppose). Since i didnt want to take risk, i first installed it on temporary location and did bandwidth and bidirectional bandwidth test provided by the OSU guys, and to my surprise, old version performs better in both scenarios.<br /><br />Could anyone give me the reason for the same?<br /><br />I repeated the above point to point&nbsp; tests between all set of nodes, but the result were same :(<br /><br />-Neeraj<br />
