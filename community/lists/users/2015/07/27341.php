<p>
I am getting this error during installation of an application.
<br>
Apparently the error seems to be complaining about openmpi being
<br>
compiled with different version of gnu fortran but I am sure that it
<br>
was compiled with gcc-4.9.2. The same is also being used for
<br>
application compilation.
<br>
<p>I am using openmpi-1.8.4
<br>
