<div class="gmail_quote">Hi,<br><br>I want to trace when the MPI  library prevents an MPI_Send from going to the socket and makes it access shared memory because the target node is on the same chip (CMP). I want to use PIN to trace this. Can you please give me some pointers about which functions are taking this decision so that I can instrument the appropriate library calls in PIN?<br clear="all">
