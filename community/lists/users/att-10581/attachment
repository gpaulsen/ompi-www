Hi Everyone, <br><br>I&#39;d like to achieve singular value decomposition with mpi. I heard about Lanczos algorith and some different kind of algorith for svd, but I need some help about this theme. Knows anybody some usable code or tutorial about parallel svd?<br>
<br>Best Regards, <br><br>Attila<br>
