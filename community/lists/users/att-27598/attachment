<p class="">I found the thread below from May. I’m setting up a new cluster and using openmpi 1.10. I have a gnu build and an Intel. Neither has libmpi.so.1. I created a symlink and it’s working. My question is if I should try to rebuild LAPACK, and is it wise to be adding that link? For me it’s just burn-in and testing. I don’t want to create issues for the scientists later. Was this link purposely removed some number of versions back?</p>

<p class="">Thanks</p>

<p class="">I copied the LAPACK benchmark binaries (xhpl being the binary) over to a development system (which </p>
<p class="">is running the same version of CentOS) but I&#39;m getting some errors trying to run the OpenMPI LAPACK benchmark </p>
<p class="">on OpenMPI 1.8.5: </p>
<p class="">xhpl: error while loading shared libraries: libmpi.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory </p>
<p class="">xhpl: error while loading shared libraries: libmpi.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory </p>
<p class="">xhpl: error while loading shared libraries: libmpi.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory </p>
<p class="">xhpl: error while loading shared libraries: libmpi.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory </p>
<p class="">When I look at the 1.8.5 install directory I find the following shared object library but no libmpi.so.1 </p>
<p class="">/apps/mpi/openmpi/1.8.5-dev/lib/libmpi.so </p>
<p class="">/apps/mpi/openmpi/1.8.5-dev/lib/libmpi.so.0 </p>
<p class="">Is it necessary to re-compile the OpenMPI LAPACK benchmark to run OpenMPI 1.8.5 </p>
<p class="">as opposed to 1.8.2? </p>
