Dear Erin,<BR>
<BR>
I'm nowhere near a guru, so I hope you don't what I have to say (it<BR>
might be wrong...).<BR>
<BR>
But what I did was just put a long loop into the program and while it<BR>
was running, I opened another window and looked at the output of &quot;top&quot;.&nbsp;<BR>
Obviously, without the loop, the program would terminate too fast.<BR>
<BR>
If you have two CPUs and the total of the process exceeds 100% (i.e., if<BR>
you run with np=2, you might have 98% and 98%), then I would think this<BR>
is enough proof that both cores are being used.<BR>
<BR>
I'm saying this on the list hoping that someone can correct my knowledge<BR>
of it, too...<BR>

&gt; I have just installed Open MPI this evening.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; I have a dual core laptop and I would like to have both cores running.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Here is the following my-hosts file:<BR>
&gt; localhost slots=2<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; and here is the command and output:<BR>
&gt;&nbsp; mpirun --hostfile my-hosts -np 4 --byslot hello_c |sort<BR>
&gt; Hello, world, I am 0 of 4<BR>
&gt; Hello, world, I am 1 of 4<BR>
&gt; Hello, world, I am 2 of 4<BR>
&gt; Hello, world, I am 3 of 4<BR>
&gt; hodgesse@erinstoy:~/Desktop/openmpi-1.2.8/examples&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; How do I know if both cores are running, please?<BR>
