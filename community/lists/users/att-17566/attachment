Hello everyone, I have a doubt about how to execute a parallel application on a cluster. I used the &#39;mpirun&#39; to execute some applications and they worked, but I guess this command only is useful with MPI applications. My question is, How do I execute a program that has no MPI statements on the cluster?<br>
If it is not possible, how do I change the structure of the program so it can be executed as a parallel application?<br><br>Jorge.
