    Hello All,<br>
    <br>
    I'm having some trouble getting Open MPI 1.8.8 to configure
    correctly when hcoll is installed in system space. That is, hcoll is
    installed to /usr/lib64 and /usr/include/hcoll. I get an error
    during configure:<br>
    <br>
    $&gt;
    <title>Konsole output</title>
    ./configure --with-hcoll
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
    <br>
    ...output snipped...<br>
    <title>Konsole output</title>
    configure:219976: checking for MCA component coll:hcoll compile mode<br>
    configure:219982: result: static<br>
    configure:220039: checking --with-hcoll value<br>
    configure:220042: result: simple ok (unspecified)<br>
    configure:220840: error: HCOLL support requested but not found. 
    Aborting<br>
    <br>
    I have also tried using "--with-hcoll=yes" and gotten the same
    behavior. Has anyone else gotten the hcoll component to build when
    hcoll itself is in system space? I am using hcoll-3.2.748.<br>
    <br>
    I did take a look at configure, and it looks like there is a test on
    "with_hcoll" to see if it is not empty and not yes on line 220072.
    In my case, this test fails, so the else clause gets invoked. The
    else clause is several hundred lines below on line 220822 and simply
    sets
    <title>Konsole output</title>
    ompi_check_hcoll_happy="no". Configure doesn't try to do anything to
    figure out if hcoll is usable, but it does quit soon after with the
    above error because ompi_check_hcoll_happy isn't "yes."<br>
    <br>
    In case it helps, here is the output from config.log for that area:<br>
    <br>
    ...output snipped...<br>
    configure:219976: checking for MCA component coll:hcoll compile mode<br>
    configure:219982: result: dso<br>
    configure:220039: checking --with-hcoll value<br>
    configure:220042: result: simple ok (unspecified)<br>
    configure:220840: error: HCOLL support requested but not found. 
    Aborting<br>

    ...output snipped...<br>
    <br>
    Have I missed something in specifying --with-hcoll? I would prefer
    not to use "--with-hcoll=/usr" as I am pretty sure that spurious
    linker flags to that area will work their way in when they
    shouldn't.<br>
    <br>
    Thanks,<br>
