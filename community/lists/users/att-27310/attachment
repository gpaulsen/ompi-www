<br>
&gt; are you running 1.8.7 or master ?<br>
1.8.7. We recently upgraded our cluster installation from OpenSUSE 11.3/OpenMPI 1.6.5 to OpenSUSE 12.3/OpenMPI 1.8.7. Before the upgrade, we did not encounter this problem.<br>
<br>
&gt; if not default, which io module are you running ?<br>
&gt; (default is ROMIO with 1.8 but ompio with master)<br>
We did not specify anything at configure time, so I guess we are using the default. But if you tell me how, I can check.<br>
<br>
&gt; by any chance, could you post a simple program that evidences this issue ?<br>
As of this time, unfortunately no. We only experience this issue intermittently, and only when running our suite of regression tests. It *seems* to occur only with a handful of the ~40 tests, but if we run only a subset of the tests (instead of all of them), it may not occur at all, depending on the subset. I tried using a MWE program but could not reproduce the issue with it.<br>
<br>
Sorry for not being more helpful, but we are also scratching our heads trying to understand what is going on and I just thought that maybe someone here has had a similar experience in the past (or might give us some pointers at what to look at).<br>
