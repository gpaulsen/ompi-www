I have compiled all my fortran source files successfully with openmpi 1.4.3 wrapper for ifort on Ubuntu 10.10, except the main progran file that contains the &quot;include mpif.h&quot; statement. It seems that the &quot;include mpif.h&quot; is deprecated and that one should now use &quot;USE mpi&quot;. However, when compiling with this I get the following message:<BR>
<BR>
Compile...<BR>
3k-1.for(2): error #7002: Error in opening the compiled module file.&nbsp; Check INCLUDE paths.&nbsp;&nbsp; [MPI]<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; USE mpi<BR>
----------^<BR>
compilation aborted for 3k-1.for (code 1)<BR>
done<BR>
<BR>
&quot;/usr/include/mpi&quot; is included in the variable $INCLUDE<BR>
<BR>
Could someone please advise on the next step to take?<BR>
<BR>
Thanks<BR>
