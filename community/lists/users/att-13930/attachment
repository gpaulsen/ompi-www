My problem starts because I require 2 processes per node, a sender<br>&gt;&gt; and a receiver and I have implemented
 these using MPI processes rather<br>&gt;&gt; than tackle the complexities of threads on MPI.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Consequently, broadcast and calls like alltoall are not completely<br>&gt;&gt; helpful.&nbsp; The dataset is huge and each node must end up with a complete<br>&gt;&gt; copy built by the large number of contributing broadcasts from the sending<br>&gt;&gt; nodes.&nbsp; Network efficiency and run time are paramount.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; As I don’t want to needlessly broadcast all this data to the sending nodes<br>&gt;&gt; and I have a perfectly good MPI program that distributes globally from a<br>&gt;&gt; single node (1 to N), I took the unusual decision to start N copies of<br>&gt;&gt; this program by spawning the MPI system from the PVM system in an effort<br>&gt;&gt; to get my N to N concurrent transfers.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; It seems that the broadcasts running on concurrent MPI environments<br>&gt;&gt; collide and cause all but
 the first process to hang waiting for their<br>&gt;&gt; broadcasts.&nbsp; This theory seems to be confirmed by introducing a sleep of<br>&gt;&gt; n-1 seconds before the first MPI_Bcast&nbsp; call on each node, which results<br>&gt;&gt; in the code working perfectly.&nbsp; (total run time 55 seconds, 3 nodes,<br>&gt;&gt; standard TCP stack)<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; My guess is that unlike PVM, OpenMPI implements broadcasts with broadcasts<br>&gt;&gt; rather than multicasts.&nbsp; Can someone confirm this?&nbsp; Is this a bug?<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Is there any multicast or N to N broadcast where sender processes can<br>&gt;&gt; avoid participating when they don’t need to?<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Thanks in advance<br>&gt;&gt; Randolph<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt;&gt; users mailing list<br>&gt;&gt; <a ymailto="mailto:users@open-mpi.org" href="x-msg://65/mc/compose?to=users@open-mpi.org">users@open-mpi.org</a><br>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/users" target="_blank">http://www.open-mpi.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/users</a><br>&gt;<br><br>-- <br>Sent from my mobile device<br><br>David Zhang<br>University of California, San Diego<br><br>_______________________________________________<br>users mailing list<br><a ymailto="mailto:users@open-mpi.org" href="x-msg://65/mc/compose?to=users@open-mpi.org">users@open-mpi.org</a><br><a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/users" target="_blank">http://www.open-mpi.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/users</a><br></div></blockquote></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
