<div dir="ltr">Dear all, <div><br></div><div>I have used OpenMPI since more than a decade and I convinced my technical director to use it into official releases of our commercial applications 4 years ago. It solved all our problems and user are quite happy of it. </div>
<div><br></div><div>Now, I am looking for a good Windows MPI solution and I am testing OpenMPI-1.6.3 from the Windows installers I downloaded few weeks ago.  But I am wondering what is the long term support? Indeed, the version 1.6.4 only propose a version for Cygwin. </div>
<div><br></div><div>So, does someone can share any information about the Windows support for the coming versions? I am mainly interested in Windows installers, Cygwin support does not really match with my expectations and constraints. </div>
