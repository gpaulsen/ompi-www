Hi,<br>I wanted to know if any have used Hypre library for the solution of Ax = b for of equations.<br>I have problems reading in matrix file. I went through user manual, but couldn&#39;t get much out of it. I wanted to know what will be the best file format for reading large sparse matrices with Hypre. <br>
Looking forward for any kind of help related to hypre. <br>Best Regard.<br>Ahnav.<br>
