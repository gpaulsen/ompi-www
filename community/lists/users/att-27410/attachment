<div dir="ltr">Hi,<div><br></div><div>I recently upgraded from openmpi 1.5.4 to openmpi 1.81 and built an application which uses parallel version of Mumps (<a href="http://mumps.enseeiht.fr/">http://mumps.enseeiht.fr/</a>) .</div><div><br></div><div>I am noticing process gets hung with np &gt; 2 but some time it works also. I am not sure if this because of the openmpi upgrade or some problem with our code. It used to work fine with 1.5.4.</div><div><br></div><div>Strace shows that process is polling some resource while it is hanged. Any pointers on how to debug this ?</div><div><br></div><div>thanks,</div><div>Kishor</div></div>
