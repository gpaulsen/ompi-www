Hi Prakash,<br>  Do i need MPI runtime environment for sure to ue those perl modules??<br>  Cant i use some other clustring software.?<br>  Where can i get MPI::Simple??<br>  <br>  Imran<br>  <br>  <br>  &gt;Hello,<br>  <br>  &gt;My users use Parallel::MPI and MPI::Simple perl modules consistently<br>  &gt;without issues. But I am not sure of the support for MPI-2 standard with<br>  &gt;either of these modules. Is there someone here that can answer that<br>  &gt;question too? Also those modules seem to work only with MPICH now and<br>  &gt;not the other MPI distributions.<br><br><b><i>Prakash Velayutham &lt;prakash.velayutham@cchmc.org&gt;</i></b> wrote:<blockquote class="replbq" style="border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255); margin-left: 5px; padding-left: 5px;">  Renato Golin wrote:<br>&gt; On 9/13/06, imran shaik <sk.imran @yahoo.com=""> wrote:<br>&gt;   <br>&gt;&gt;  I need to run parallel jobs on a cluster typically of size 600 nodes and<br>&gt;&gt; running SGE, but
 the programmers are good at perl but not C or C++.

If your<br>&gt; problem is easily splittable (like parse a large apache log, read a<br>&gt; large xml list of things) you might be able to split the data and<br>&gt; spawn as many process as you can.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I do it using LSF (another dispatcher) and a Makefile that controls<br>&gt; the dependencies and spawn the processes (using make's -j flag) and it<br>&gt; works quite well. But if your job need the communication (like<br>&gt; processing big matrices, collecting and distributing data among<br>&gt; processes etc) you'll need an interprocess communication and that's<br>&gt; what MPI is best at.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; In a nutshell, you'll need the runtime
 environment to run MPI programs<br>&gt; as well as you need SGE's runtime environments on every node to<br>&gt; dispatch jobs and collect information.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; About MPI bindings for Perl, there's this module:<br>&gt; http://search.cpan.org/~josh/Parallel-MPI-0.03/MPI.pm<br>&gt;<br>&gt; but it's far too young to be trustworthy, IMHO, and you'll probably<br>&gt; need the MPI runtime on all nodes as well...<br>&gt;<br>&gt; cheers,<br>&gt; --renato<br>Hello,<br><br>My users use Parallel::MPI and MPI::Simple perl modules consistently<br>without issues.
