<div class="">Wow, I didn't realize that my prior employer had let the domain lapse.</div>

</div>
<div class="">Well, perhaps it was time. &nbsp;We haven't changed anything about LAM/MPI in ...a decade? &nbsp;Now that the domain is gone, since I don't even have an SVN checkout any more, I can't check when the last meaningful commit was. &nbsp;I see Rob found a ROMIO commit
 in 2007.</div>

</div>
<div class="">That should be correct. &nbsp;MPI should be source code compatible.</div>

</div>
<div class="">mpirun options will be different, of course. &nbsp;And there's no lamboot and lamhalt.</div>

<blockquote type="cite" class="">Yeah, any other recommendations I can give to convince the powers-that-be that immediate sun-setting of LAM/MPI would be great. &nbsp; Sometimes I feel&nbsp;like I am trying&nbsp;to fit a square peg in a round hole&nbsp;L<br class="">

How's this:
<div class=""><br class="">
</div>
<div class="">- Brian Barrett and myself were the primary maintainers of LAM/MPI.</div>
<div class="">- Brian and I moved on to Open MPI about a decade ago.</div>
<div class="">- There have been no releases of LAM/MPI in many years.</div>
<div class="">- There won't be any future releases of LAM/MPI, ever.</div>
<div class="">- There is zero support for LAM/MPI.</div>
<div class="">- Open MPI has MUCH better support for run-time systems and modern networks.<br class="">
<div class="">- Open MPI has an active developer and user community.</div>
<div class="">- Open MPI is supported by multiple different vendors.</div>
<div class="">- Jeff Immelt wants you to move away from LAM/MPI.</div>
