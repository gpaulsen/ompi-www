I am doing some testing on a variety of 8-core nodes in which I just
want to execute a couple of executables and have them distributed to
the available cores without overlapping. Typically, this would be done
with a parameter like <i>-machinefile machines</i>, but I have no idea
what names to put into the <i>machines</i> file as this is a single
node with two quad core cpu's. As I am launching the jobs sans
scheduler, I need to specify what cores to run on I would think to keep
from overscheduling some cores while others receive nothing to do at
all.<br>
<br>
Simple suggestions? Maybe Open MPI takes care of this detail for me?<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
