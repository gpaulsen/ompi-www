<div dir="ltr">I know 1.8.4 is better than 1.6.5 in some regards, but I obviously can&#39;t say if we fixed the specific bug you&#39;re referring to in your software. As you know, thread bugs are really hard to nail down.<div><br></div><div>That event_base_loop warning could be flagging a known problem in the openib module during inter-process connection formation. It&#39;s been on our radar for awhile, but lacked cycles to resolve it. You might double-check by running with &quot;--mca btl ^openib&quot; to see if that is the source of the warning - I know it will run a lot slower, but you *might* get an indication as to whether this is or isn&#39;t the issue.</div><div><br></div><div>Does it only crash when you pause it?

I used &quot;xxx.yyy.zzz&quot; instead of &quot;localhost&quot; in the startup options for orterun. (More precisely the GUI did it, but I knew that code.)

I manually enabled this between 3 selected workers, and checked that everything worked fine then.

Even if the shell would not freeze, and orterun would stop (after first forwarding the signal to all workers, which seems to be the most reasonable behavior to me), I would still have to use &quot;kill -SIGSTOP 12345&quot; (because I don&#39;t want to pause the workers, only the master).

Maybe the new &quot;[warn] opal_libevent2021_event_base_loop: reentrant invocation.  Only one event_base_loop can run on each event_base at once.&quot; warning tries to tell me that I&#39;m using MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE incorrectly. But I radically simplified my mpi calls for this test now, such that I only call MPI_Send and MPI_Recv, and only on MPI_COMM_WORLD. But I still get the warning with 1.8.4, and still can produce my crash with 1.6.5, and still cannot reproduce my crash with 1.8.4. Is it really possible that MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE had a bug (the clusters were this bug can be triggered have infiniband interconnect) in 1.6.5, which is fixed in 1.8.4?</div><div class="gmail_quote"><br></div><div class="gmail_quote">I still fear that the bug is somewhere else in my software (because of the history of this bug and how hard it often was to trigger it in the past).</div></div></div>
