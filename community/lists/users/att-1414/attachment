<div>I have been using termios.h to&nbsp;detect a keypress and&nbsp;then deal with it inside of a loop and when&nbsp;porting&nbsp;it over to mpi, and using mpirun it now will&nbsp;wait and the loop&nbsp;is paused waiting for a carrige return checking for a keypress. 
</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I then&nbsp;tried ncurses with nodelay() function and the loop continues but still requires a return before it deals with the&nbsp;input inside of mpirun. Where alone it would respond to a keypress without a return.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Both methods above are contained within if( rank == 0 ) { }&nbsp;and in a for(;;)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>And I am using svn checkout of OpenMPI.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would like to be able to press a key within&nbsp;a loop in main to change values and exit the loop. Very&nbsp;easy with&nbsp;both methods above. But mpirun seems to alter the&nbsp;behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Do any of you know of a method to acomplish this within an mpi application. I want to loop forever and respong to keyboard input when it comes in or shortly there after.</div>
