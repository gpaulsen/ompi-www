<div style="direction: ltr;font-family: Tahoma;color: #000000;font-size: 10pt;">Hi ,
<br>
<br>
I am wondering how can I solve this problem. <br>
System Spec:<br>
1- Linux cluster with two nodes (master and slave) with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 32bit.<br>
2- openmpi 1.8.4<br>
<br>
I do a simple test running on fehg_node_0:<br>
&gt; mpirun -host fehg_node_0,fehg_node_1 hello_world -mca oob_base_verbose 20<br>
<br>
and I get the following error:<br>
<br>
A process or daemon was unable to complete a TCP connection<br>
to another process:<br>
&nbsp; Local host:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fehg-node-0<br>
&nbsp; Remote host:&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.104.5.40<br>
This is usually caused by a firewall on the remote host. Please<br>
check that any firewall (e.g., iptables) has been disabled and<br>
try again.<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
ORTE was unable to reliably start one or more daemons.<br>
This usually is caused by:<br>
<br>
* not finding the required libraries and/or binaries on<br>
&nbsp; one or more nodes. Please check your PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH<br>
&nbsp; settings, or configure OMPI with --enable-orterun-prefix-by-default<br>
<br>
* lack of authority to execute on one or more specified nodes.<br>
&nbsp; Please verify your allocation and authorities.<br>
<br>
* the inability to write startup files into /tmp (--tmpdir/orte_tmpdir_base).<br>
&nbsp; Please check with your sys admin to determine the correct location to use.<br>
<br>
*&nbsp; compilation of the orted with dynamic libraries when static are required<br>
&nbsp; (e.g., on Cray). Please check your configure cmd line and consider using<br>
&nbsp; one of the contrib/platform definitions for your system type.<br>
<br>
* an inability to create a connection back to mpirun due to a<br>
&nbsp; lack of common network interfaces and/or no route found between<br>
&nbsp; them. Please check network connectivity (including firewalls<br>
&nbsp; and network routing requirements).<br>
<br>
Verbose:<br>
1- I have full access to the VMs on the cluster and setup everything myself<br>
2- Firewall and iptables are all disabled on the nodes<br>
3- nodes can ssh to each other with&nbsp; no problem<br>
4- non-interactive bash calls works fine i.e. when I run ssh othernode env | grep PATH from both nodes, both PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH are set correctly<br>
5- I have checked the posts, a similar problem reported for Solaris but I could not find a clue about mine.
<br>
6- run with --enable-orterun-prefix-by-default does not make any changes.<br>
7-&nbsp; I see orte is running on the other node when I check processes, but nothing happens after that and the error happens.<br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
Karos</div>
