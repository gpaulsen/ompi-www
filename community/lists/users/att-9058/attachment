I found some programs on this link : <a href="http://lam-mpi.lzu.edu.cn/tutorials/nd/part1/">http://lam-mpi.lzu.edu.cn/tutorials/nd/part1/</a><br><br>will these program run on my openmpi cluster? <br><br>actually i want to run some image processing program on my cluster, as i cannot write the entire code of the program can anyone tell where can i get ip programs.<br>
<br>I know this is the wrong place to ask but thought would give it a try as i cannot find anything on the net.<br><br><br>
