    Hi Alex,<br>
    <br>
    Building Open MPI using CMake is the recommended procedure, you
    probably should stick with it, and it has been proved working well
    on different Windows platforms. The other building procedures are
    not well supported for some time now, and they are deprecated.<br>
    <br>
    For the problems that you got when building with CMake, it might
    because some dependent headers/libraries are not installed. Could
    you please provide the detail CMake error output, so that I can help
    you fix it?<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Regards,<br>
    Shiqing<br>

      <div>This is my first time posting on an email list, so if I don't
        follow certain protocols just tell me. Anyway, I am working at a
        research lab as a High School Summer Intern, and part of my
        project involves installing OpenMPI on a Windows machine to run
        some applications in virtual clusters. I tried following the
        first two methods from the Windows ReadMe file, but none of them
        work. For the first one, there are a bunch of header files cMake
        can't find. For the second one, the cannot find the
        ompi-static.tgz tarball. The set of files that I downloaded from
        OpenMPI can be found here (tried both tars):&nbsp;<a
          moz-do-not-send="true"
          href="http://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v1.4/">http://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v1.4/</a>&nbsp;.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>I noticed however that the ompi-static tarball can be found
        in the Subversion that i obtained this way:<a
          moz-do-not-send="true"
          href="http://www.open-mpi.org/svn/mercurial.php">http://www.open-mpi.org/svn/mercurial.php</a>&nbsp;.
        Can anyone tell me what I might be doing wrong? Or maybe more
        detailed steps? it's the first time I work with OpenMPI or any
        similar technologies.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>Thanks for your help,</div>
