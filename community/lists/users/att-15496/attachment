How closely tied is a specific release of OpenMPI to the host operating

&gt; I use OpenMPI on a variety of platforms: &nbsp;stand-alone servers
running<br>

&gt; also Linux (again CentOS) on large clusters of AMD/Intel boxes. &nbsp;These<br>
&gt; platforms all have some version of the 1.3 OpenMPI stream. &nbsp;I
recently<br>
&gt; requested an upgrade on all systems to 1.4.3 (for production work)
and<br>
&gt; 1.5.1 (for experimentation). &nbsp;I'm getting a lot of push back
from the<br>
&gt; SysAdmin folks claiming that OpenMPI is closely intertwined with the<br>
&gt; specific version of the operating system and/or other system software<br>
&gt; (i.e., Rocks on the clusters). &nbsp;I need to know if they are telling
me<br>
&gt; the truth or if they're just making excuses to avoid the work. &nbsp;To
state<br>
&gt; my question another way: &nbsp;Apparently each release of Linux and/or
Rocks<br>
&gt; comes with some version of OpenMPI bundled in. &nbsp;Is it dangerous
in some<br>
&gt; way to upgrade to a newer version of OpenMPI? &nbsp;Thanks in advance
for any<br>
&gt; insight anyone can provide.<br>

OpenMPI is more or less a user-space program, and isn't that tightly<br>
coupled to the OS at all. As long as the OS has the correct network<br>
drivers (ethernet, IB, or other), that's all OpenMPI needs to do it's<br>
job. In fact, you can install it yourself in your own home directory (if<br>
 your home directory is shared amongst the cluster nodes you want to<br>
use), and run it from there - no special privileges needed.<br>
<br>
I have many different versions of OpenMPI installed on my systems,<br>
without a problem.<br>
<br>
As a system administrator responsible for maintaining OpenMPI on several<br>
clusters, it sounds like one of two things:<br>
<br>
1. Your system administrators really don't know what they're talking<br>
about, or,<br>
<br>
2. They're lying to you to avoid doing work.<br>
