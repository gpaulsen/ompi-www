Hello,<br><br>I'm having trouble with some MPI programming in Fortran, using openmpi.<br>It seems that my program doesn't work unless I print some unrelated text to the screen. For example, if I have this situation:<br><br>*** hundreds of lines cut ***<br>IF (irank .eq. 0) THEN<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CALL print_results1(variable)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CALL print_results2(more_variable)<br>END IF<br>print *, "done", irank<br>CALL MPI_FINALIZE(ierr)<br>END PROGRAM calculation<br><br>The results are not printed unless I include this "print done irank" penultimate line.<br>Also, despite seeing that all ranks reach the print statement, the program hangs, as if they have not all reached MPI_FINALIZE.<br><br>Can anyone help me? Why does it do this?<br><br>I also had many times where the program would crash if I didn't include a print statement in a loop. I've been doing Fortran programming for a while, and this is my nightmare debugging scenario since I've never been able to figure out why the simple printing of statements magically fixes the program, and I usually end up having to go back to a serial solution, which is really slow.<br><br>If anyone might be able to help me, I would be really really grateful!!<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Tom<br><br> 		 	   		  </body>
