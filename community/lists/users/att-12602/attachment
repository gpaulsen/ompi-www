<div class="gmail_quote">Hello,<br>I have successfully installed MPE for my existing Open-MPI installation and have been able compile using the compiler wrapper &#39;mpecc&#39;.<br>But, I have some C++ MPI programs which cannot be compiled using mpecc. How do I achieve this,or do I need to make changes to my MPE installation procedure? I used the following command for my current installation.<br>


<br>./configure --prefix=/gpfs/fs3/home/xxx/mybin \<br>MPI_CC=/sw/openmpi/bin/mpicc \<br>--disable-f77 \<br>--with-java=/usr/java/jdk1.6.0_13 <br><br>(Also, I have managed to use mpecc, but not &#39;mpicc -mpilog hello.c&#39; Is this assumption even correct for Open-MPI or is it an option only for MPICH )<br>


<br>Thank you.<br>~ ridZ<br>
