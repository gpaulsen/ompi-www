<br>
Just in case ...<br>
If you&#39;re using a resource manager to start the jobs (Torque, etc),<br>
you need to have them set the limits (for coredump size, stacksize, locked memory size, etc).<br>
This way the jobs will inherit the limits from the<br>
resource manager daemon.<br>
On Torque (which I use) I do this on the pbs_mom daemon<br>
init script (I am still before the systemd era, that lovely POS).<br>
And set the hard/soft limits on /etc/security/limits.conf as well.<br>
<br>
I hope this helps,<br>

I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t know what a .btr file is -- that is not something that is controlled by Open MPI.<br>
<br>
You might want to look into your OS settings to see if it has some kind of alternate corefile mechanism...?<br>

Hello all<br>
<br>
I run MPI jobs (for test purpose only) on two different &#39;clusters&#39;. Both &#39;clusters&#39; have two nodes only, connected back-to-back. The two are very similar, but not identical, both software and hardware wise.<br>
<br>
Both have ulimit -c set to unlimited. However, only one of the two creates core files when an MPI job crashes. The other creates a text file named something like<br>
&lt;program_name_that_crashed&gt;.80s-&lt;a-number-that-looks-like-a-PID&gt;,&lt;hostname-where-the-crash-happened&gt;.btr<br>
<br>
I&#39;d much prefer a core file because that allows me to debug with a lot more options than a static text file with addresses. How do I get a core file in all situations? I am using MPI source from the master branch.<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance<br>
Durga<br>
