<div dir="ltr"><div><div><div>Hi Ralph,<br><br></div>Good to know you&#39;ve reproduced it.  I was experiencing this using both the hostfile and host key.  A simple comm_spawn was working for me as well, but it was only launching locally, and I&#39;m pretty sure each node only has 4 slots given past behavior (the mpirun -np 8 example I gave in my first email launches on both hosts).  Is there a way to specify the hosts I want to launch on without the hostfile or host key so I can test remote launch?<br><br></div>And to the &quot;hostname&quot; response...no wonder it was hanging!  I just constructed that as a basic example.  In my real use I&#39;m launching something that calls MPI_Init.<br><br></div>Evan<br><div><div><div><div><br><br></div></div></div></div></div>
