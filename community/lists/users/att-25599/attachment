      <p>Hello,</p>
      <br>
      After compiling and running a MPI program, it seems to hang at
      MPI_Init(), but it eventually will work after a minute or two. <br>
      <p>While the problem occured on my Notebook it did not on my
        desktop PC. Both run on Win 7, cygwin 64 Bit, OpenMPI version
        1.8.3 r32794 (ompi_info), g++ v 4.8.3. I actually synced the
        cygwin installations later on, and it still didn't work, but it
        did for a short time after a restart...</p>
      <p>When I started a program on my desktop PC my Firewall Comodo
        5.10 notified me about orterun.exe (mpirun is only a symlink to
        orterun) and myprogram.exe. After I (permanently) allowed these
        two programs the started program still didn't resume execution.
        After canceling the program and restarting it, the program ran
        without problems, meaning it ran fast. Because of this, it seems
        to me that OpenMPI maybe has only insufficient error-handling if
        it can't connect instantly. Maybe this is somehow related to the
        problem?</p>
      <p>The problem existed quite some months on my notebook, so I DID
        restart the notebook before without the problem being solved.
        I also have Ubuntu on that notebook and there I can compile and
        run MPI programs just fine.</p>
      <p>I'm using Comodo Firewall 5.10. on my Desktop and absolutely no
        Firewall, not even the Windows Firewall (deactivated) on my
        Notebook. Installing Comodo 5.10 on my notebook didn't help
        either. But everything worked after restarting, so maybe the
        Firewall wasn't completely in place yet? But the Installation
        program didn't prompt me to restart and the Firewall was already
        working, so ...</p>
      <p>A compiled version from my desktop PC did run on my notebook
        with mpirun... Alas I couldn't replicate this and I tried for
        hours now. Because of this I thought the error lay in the
        compiler or OpenMPI-libraries, but it seems it only works at
        complete random times.</p>
      <p>After syncing my cygwin installation on my notebook with the
        one on my desktop, installing a firewall where I allowed all
        affected programs and restarting my notebook it also shortly
        worked, but again after that it didn't, so this "fix" may have
        coincided with a "good" time.</p>
      <p>Other people have stories of their VPN software interfering
        with OpenMPI and causing exactly these problems, but I don't
        have such a software running.</p>
      <p>Things I also fruitlessly tried:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>closing programs which could jam TCP-IP connections</li>
        <li>ping 127.0.0.1 works &lt;1ms</li>
        <li>running bash as administrator</li>
        <li>running orterun/mpirun from windows cmd instead of
          cygwin-bash</li>
        <li>stopping Windows Firewall Service and Windows Defender
          completely</li>
        <li>using MPI_Init(NULL,NULL); instead of
          MPI_Init(&amp;argc,&amp;argv);</li>
        <li>compiling with gcc instead of g++</li>
        <li>the program works fine, if I don't start it with mpirun, but
          it also doesn't work, if I start it with mpirun -n 1</li>
        <li>update Windows</li>
        <li>using safe mode (with network drivers)</li>
        <li>trying to debug it (I can't get a useful backtrace to the
          MPI_init call)</li>
      </ul>
