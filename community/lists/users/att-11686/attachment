<P><FONT SIZE=2>It's complicated, but the short answer is that a &quot;short&quot; message is defined as one where the cost of a memory copy doesn't matter.<BR>
<BR>
You could always use mpi_alloc_mem to get registered memory. But I don't recall offhand if we check to see if the memory is already registered for short messages (because the cost of the memcpy is insignificant).<BR>
<BR>
Yes, the cost of mem reg is one of the main drivers for these kinds of optimizations.<BR>

Subject: [OMPI users] Question about senting short MPI messages using RDMA<BR>
<BR>
Hi, guys.<BR>
As I understand, to send short MPI messages, OpenMPI copies the<BR>
messages to preallocated buffer and then uses RDMA.<BR>
<BR>
I was wondering if we can avoid the overhead of memory copy. If the<BR>
user buffers for short messages are reused a lot, we can just register<BR>
the user buffer instead of using preallocated buffer. Then we can do<BR>
RDMA directly from the user buffer instead of the preallocated buffer.<BR>
But if the user buffers are not reused, we will suffer from the<BR>
overhead of memory registration.<BR>
<BR>
Besides the overhead of memory registration, is there any other reason<BR>
that prevent you to do RDMA directly from the user buffer for short<BR>
messages?<BR>
<BR>
Thank you.<BR>
