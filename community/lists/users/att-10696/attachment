<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thanks for your interest in my problem. However, the points you had raised earlier in your mails, seems to me that, I had already taken care of them. I had enlisted them below pointwise. Your comments are rewritten in <font color="#ff0000"><strong>RED </strong></font><font color="#000000">and my replies in <strong>BLACK.</strong></font></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1) As you have mentioned: "<strong><font color="#ff0000">I would guess you only installed OpenMPI only on ict1, not on ict2</font></strong>". However, I had mentioned initially: "<strong>I had installed openmpi-1.3.3 separately on two of my machines ict1 and ict2</strong>".</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2) Next you said: "<strong><font color="#ff0000">I am guessing this, because you used a prefix under /usr/local</font></strong>". However, I had installed them under: </div>
<div><strong>$ mkdir build<br>$ cd build<br>$ ../configure --prefix=/usr/local/openmpi-1.3.3/<br># make all install</strong> </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>3) Next as you pointed out: "<strong> <font color="#ff0000">...not a typical name of an NFS mounted directory. Using an NFS mounted directory is another way to make OpenMPI visible to all nodes</font> </strong>".</div>

<div>Let me tell you once again, that I am not going for an NFS installation as the first point in this list makes it clear.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>4) In your next mail: " <strong><font color="#ff0000">If you can ssh passwordless from ict1 to ict2 *and* vice versa</font> </strong>". Again as I had mentioned earlier " <strong>As a prerequisite, I can ssh between them without a password or passphrase ( I did not supply the passphrase at all ).</strong> "</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>5) Further as you said: " <strong><font color="#ff0000">If your /etc/hosts file on *both* machines list ict1 and ict2<br>and their IP addresses</font> </strong>".&nbsp;Let me mention here that, these things are already very well taken care of.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>6) Finally as you said: " <strong><font color="#ff0000">In case you have a /home directory on each machine (i.e. /home is not NFS mounted) if your .bashrc files on *both* machines set the PATH<br>and LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the OpenMPI directory.</font> </strong>"</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Again as I had mentioned previously,&nbsp; <strong>Also .bash_profile and .bashrc had the following lines written into them:<br><br>PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/openmpi-1.3.3/bin/<br>LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/openmpi-1.3.3/lib/</strong></div>

<div><strong>***************************************************************************************************************</strong></div>
<div><strong></strong>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As an additional bit of information, (which might assist you in the investigation) I had used <strong>Mandriva 2009.1</strong> on all of my systems.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope, this will help you. Eagerly awaiting a response.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thanks,<br>&nbsp;</div>

Recently, I had installed openmpi-1.3.3 separately on two of my machines ict1 and ict2. These machines are dual-socket quad-core (Intel Xeon E5410) i.e. each having 8 processors and are connected by Gigabit ethernet switch. As a prerequisite, I can ssh between them without a password or passphrase ( I did not supply the passphrase at all ). Thereafter,<br>
