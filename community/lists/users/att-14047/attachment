Hi,<br>I am currently using RAxML 7.0, and recently I got a problem. Even though I Googled  it, I couldn&#39;t find a satisfying answer. <br>I
 got this message from BATCH_ERRORs file &quot; raxmlHPC-MPI: 
topologies.c:179: restoreTL: Assertion `n &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; n &lt; 
rl-&gt;max&#39; failed. &quot;<br>
<br>Any help is appreciated,<br><br>Thanks,<br clear="all"><br>-- <br>Gokhan  <br>
