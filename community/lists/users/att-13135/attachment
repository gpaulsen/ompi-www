When I specify the hosts separately on the commandline, as follows, the process completes as expected. <br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">mpirun -np 8 -host remotehost,localhost myapp<br></div>Output appears for the localhost and a textfile is created on the remotehost<br>
<br>However when I use a hostfile the remote processes never complete. I can see the output from the local processes and by remote login I can see that that processes are being started on the remote machine but never complete.<br>
<br>The is a simple reduce example using boost.mpi (v1.43) I&#39;m using windows 7 x64 pro on both machines and openmpi 1.4.2 the hostfile and athe app are in the same locaion on both machines.<br><br>Any idea why this is happening?<br>
