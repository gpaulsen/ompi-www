<div dir="ltr">Hello,<div>How does mpirun or mpiexec handle Ctrl+C? I noticed when I use Ctrl+C on a running python script (without MPI), this generates a KeyboardInterrupt exception which I can catch and do something with, but when I use mpirun to run the python script, so far as I can tell, no exception is generated; the script just dies. I&#39;d like to be able to catch an exception within my script and do some cleaning up before killing the script, but I can&#39;t figure out how to do this. I&#39;ve already posted on the mpi4py message board (<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mpi4py/x8tloLNGWTk">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mpi4py/x8tloLNGWTk</a>) and was referred here.</div><div>Thanks!</div><div>Seth</div></div>
