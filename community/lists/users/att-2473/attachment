<BR>
Open MPI needs to create a temporary file system &#8211; what we call our &#8220;session directory&#8221; - where it stores things like the shared memory file. From this output, it appears that your /tmp directory is &#8220;locked&#8221; to root access only.<BR>
<BR>
You have three options for resolving this problem:<BR>
<BR>
(a) you could make /tmp accessible to general users;<BR>
<BR>
(b) you could use the &#8212;tmpdir xxx command line option to point Open MPI at another directory that is accessible to the user (for example, you could use a &#8220;tmp&#8221; directory under the user&#8217;s home directory); or<BR>
<BR>
(c) you could set an MCA parameter OMPI_MCA_tmpdir_base to identify a directory we can use instead of /tmp.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;If you select options (b) or (c), the only requirement is that this location must be accessible on every node being used. Let me be clear on this: the tmp directory <B>must not</B> be NSF mounted and therefore shared across all nodes. However, each node must be able to access a location of the given name &#8211; that location should be strictly local to each node.<BR>
<BR>
Hope that helps<BR>

I have recently installed OpenMPI 1.1.2 on a OpenSSI cluster running Fedora core 3. I tested a simple hello world mpi program (attached) and it runs ok as root. However, if I run the same program under normal user, it gives the following error: <BR>

It looks like MPI_INIT failed for some reason; your parallel process is<BR>
likely to abort. &nbsp;There are many reasons that a parallel process can<BR>
fail during MPI_INIT; some of which are due to configuration or environment <BR>
problems. &nbsp;This failure appears to be an internal failure; here's some<BR>
additional information (which may only be relevant to an Open MPI<BR>

Am I need to give certain permission to the user in order to oversubscribe processes?<BR>
<BR>
Thanks in advance,<BR>
