<body class='hmmessage'><div dir='ltr'><br><br>Hallo,<br><br>I am working on a server and run java codes with OpenMPI. I want to know which number of process is the fastest to run my code with?<br>For this reason I wrote a code that multiply two matrices but the differences between the results is not significant. <br><br>Therefore I want to know how can I benchmark my server? Or is there any example which I can run many times on a different number of processes, so that I can see which number of process is the best?<br><br>Or is there examples with results which I can compare with my results?<br><br>Thanx in advance<br>Ibrahim<br> 		 	   		  </div></body>
