Hi,<br><br>Is there any standard way of attaching/retrieving attributes to MPI_Request object?<br><br>Eg. Typically there are dynamic user data created when starting the asynchronous operation and freed when it completes. It would be convenient to associate them with the request object itself to simplify the code.
<br><br>Thanks for your help,<br>Oleg Morajko<br><br><br>
