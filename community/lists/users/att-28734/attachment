Do you see the PSM MTL listed?<br>
<br>
To force the CM MTL, you can run:<br>
<br>
  mpirun --mca pml cm ...<br>
<br>
That won&#39;t let any BTLs be selected (because only ob1 uses the BTLs).<br>

&gt; can you try to add<br>
&gt; --mca mtl psm<br>
&gt; to your mpirun command line ?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; you might also have to blacklist the opening btl<br>

&gt; Hello all<br>
&gt; I have a simple test setup, consisting of two Dell workstation nodes with similar hardware profile.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Both the nodes have (identical)<br>
&gt; 1. Qlogic 4x DDR infiniband<br>
&gt; 2. Chelsio C310 iWARP ethernet.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Both of these cards are connected back to back, without a switch.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; With this setup, I can run OpenMPI over TCP and openib BTL. However, if I try to use the PSM MTL (excluding the Chelsio NIC, of course, since it does not support PSM), I get an error from one of the nodes (details below), which makes me think that a required library or package is not installed, but I can&#39;t figure out what it might be.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Note that the test program is a simple &#39;hello world&#39; program.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The following work:<br>
&gt;   mpirun -np 2 --hostfile ~/hostfile -mca btl tcp,self ./mpitest<br>
&gt; mpirun -np 2 --hostfile ~/hostfile -mca btl self,openib -mca btl_openib_if_exclude cxgb3_0 ./mpitest<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; (I had to exclude the Chelsio card because of this issue:<br>
&gt; <a href="https://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/users/2016/03/28661.php" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/users/2016/03/28661.php</a>  )<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Here is what does NOT work:<br>
&gt; mpirun -np 2 --hostfile ~/hostfile -mca mtl psm -mca btl_openib_if_exclude cxgb3_0 ./mpitest<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The error (from both nodes) is:<br>
&gt;  mca: base: components_open: component pml / cm open function failed<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; However, I still see the &quot;Hello, world&quot; output indicating that the program ran to completion.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Here is also another command that does NOT work:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; mpirun -np 2 --hostfile ~/hostfile -mca pml cm -mca btl_openib_if_exclude cxgb3_0 ./mpitest<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The error is: (from the root node)<br>
&gt; PML cm cannot be selected<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; However, this time, I see no output from the program, indicating it did not run.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The following command also fails in a similar way:<br>
&gt;  mpirun -np 2 --hostfile ~/hostfile -mca pml cm -mca mtl psm -mca btl_openib_if_exclude cxgb3_0 ./mpitest<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I have verified that infinipath-psm is installed on both nodes. Both nodes run identical CentOS 7 and the libraries were installed from the CentOS repositories (i.e. were not compiled from source)<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Both nodes run OMPI 1.10.2, compiled from the source RPM.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; What am I doing wrong?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Thanks<br>
&gt; Durga<br>
