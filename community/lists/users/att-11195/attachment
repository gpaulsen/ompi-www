I&#39;m confused about the required behavior of MPI_Send() using TCP sockets.  Does a call to MPI_Send() block until the receiving process actually receives the message, or does MPI_Send() only block until the send operation completes locally?  In other words, does the sender actually have to wait for an ACK from the receiver to proceed?<br>
