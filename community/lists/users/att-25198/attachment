I understand how using the --cpuset option would help me in the example I described. However, suppose I have multiple users submitting MPI jobs of various sizes? I wouldn't know a priori which cores were in use and which weren't. I always assumed that this is what these various schedulers did. Is there a way to map-by socket but not allow a single core to be used by more than one process. At first glance, I thought that --map-by socket and --bind-to core would do this. Would one of these "NOOVERSUBSCRIBE" options help?<br></div></blockquote><div><br></div>I'm afraid not - the issue here is that the mpirun's don't know about each other. What you'd need to do is have your scheduler assign cores for our use - we'll pick that up and stay inside that envelope. The exact scheduler command depends on the scheduler, of course, but the scheduler would then have the more global picture and could keep things separated.</div><div><br><blockquote type="cite"><div style="font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><br>Also, in my test case, I have exactly the right amount of cores (240) to run 15 jobs using 16 MPI processes.

If you try to run as you described, with 2ppn for each mpirun and 12 cores/node, you can run a maximum of 6 mpirun's at a time across a given set of nodes. So you'd need to stage your allocations correctly to make it work.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br><blockquote type="cite"><div style="font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;"><br>------------------------------<br><br>Date: Thu, 28 Aug 2014 13:27:12 -0700<br>From: Ralph Castain &lt;<a href="mailto:rhc@open-mpi.org">rhc@open-mpi.org</a>&gt;<br>To: Open MPI Users &lt;<a href="mailto:users@open-mpi.org">users@open-mpi.org</a>&gt;<br>Subject: Re: [OMPI users] How does binding option affect network<br><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;">	</span>traffic?<br>Message-ID: &lt;<a href="mailto:637CAEF5-BBB3-46C2-9387-DECDF8CBDDD6@open-mpi.org">637CAEF5-BBB3-46C2-9387-DECDF8CBDDD6@open-mpi.org</a>&gt;<br>Content-Type: text/plain; charset="windows-1252"<br><br><br>On Aug 28, 2014, at 11:50 AM, McGrattan, Kevin B.

The problem is that each mpirun execution has no idea what the others are doing, or even that they exist. Thus, they will each independently bind to core zero and core 6, as you observe. You can get around this by submitting each with a separate --cpuset argument telling it which cpus it is allowed to use - something like this (note that there is no value to having pe=1 as that is automatically what happens with bind-to core):<br><br>mpirun --cpuset 0,6 --bind-to core &nbsp;....<br>mpirun --cpuset 1,7 --bind-to core &nbsp;...<br><br>etc. You specified only two procs/node with your PBS request, so we'll only map two on each node. This command line tells the first mpirun to only use cores 0 and 6, and to bind each proc to one of those cores. The second uses only cores 1 and 7, and thus is separated from the first command.<br><br>However, you should note that you can't run 15 jobs at the same time in the manner you describe without overloading some cores as you only have 12 cores/node.
