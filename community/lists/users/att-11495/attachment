What is the difference between connectivity_c and ring_c or hello_c? Under what circumstances should one fail and not the others...<br><br>I am having a huge problem with openMPI, and trying to get to the bottom of it by understanding the differences between the example files, connectivity, hello, and ring.<br>

<br>1st off, ring_c and hello_c seem to work fine with up to -np 250<br><br>connectivity_c works reliably when -np &lt;5, but less that 30% of the time when -np &gt;6.  When it does not work, it just hangs.. no output..  here is a screenshot of TOP with mpirun -np 8 connectivity_c hanging..<br>

<br>I am using Ubuntu 9.10, kernel 2.6.31-16, Nehelem processors.  Hyperthreading is enabled. <br><br>Thanks!<br clear="all">_________________________________<br>Matthew MacManes<br>PhD Candidate<br>University of California- Berkeley<br>
