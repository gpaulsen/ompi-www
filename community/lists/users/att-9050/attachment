Hi <br />Thanks for your response. <br />However, I am running <br />mpiexec  .... -ppn 24 -n 192 /opt/IMB-MPI1 alltaoll -msglen /root/temp <br /><br />And file /root/temp contains entry upto 65535 size only. That means alltoall test will run upto 65K size only<br /><br />So, in that case I will require very less memory but then in that case also test is running out-of-memory. Please help someone to understand the scenario.<br />Or do I need to switch to some algorithm or do I need to set some other environment variables ? or anything like that ?<br /><br />On Apr 22, 2009 6:43pm, Ashley Pittman &lt;ashley@pittman.co.uk&gt; wrote:<br />&gt; On Wed, 2009-04-22 at 12:40 +0530, vkm wrote:<br />&gt; <br />&gt; <br />&gt; <br />&gt; &gt; The same amount of memory required for recvbuf.

Please correct.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; <br />&gt; <br />&gt; Your calculation looks correct, the conclusion is slightly wrong<br />&gt; <br />&gt; however.  The Application buffers will consume 36Gb of memory, the rest<br />&gt; <br />&gt; of the application, any comms buffers and the usual OS overhead will be<br />&gt; <br />&gt; on top of this so putting only 36Gb of ram in your nodes will still<br />&gt; <br />&gt; leave you short.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; <br />&gt; <br />&gt; Ashley,<br />&gt; <br />&gt; <br />&gt;
