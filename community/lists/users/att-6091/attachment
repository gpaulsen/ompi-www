<div dir="ltr">Hi,<br><br>Sorry about my previous message, it was sent before I&#39;d finished composing it.<br><br>Whenever I use MPI_File_write_ordered(), all but one process send the following message to stderr.<br>ADIOI_GEN_DELETE (line 22): **io No such file or directory<br>

<br>I have read<br><a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/users/2008/01/4936.php" target="_blank">http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/users/2008/01/4936.php</a><br>which suggests that this message appears because my program is trying to delete a file that does not exist, but my program does not explicitly delete any files. I&#39;ve included a test program to demonstrate the message. <br>

<br>Is there anything I can do to avoid or suppress this message?<br>The message I referred to before says that I could &quot;ignore errors from
MPI_File_delete&quot;.&nbsp; How do I do that?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Brian<br><br>int<br>main( int argc, char *argv[]){<br><br>&nbsp; char buff[2] = &quot;a&quot;;<br>&nbsp; MPI_File fh;<br>&nbsp; MPI_Status status;<br><br>&nbsp; MPI_Init( &amp;argc, &amp;argv );<br>

<br>&nbsp; MPI_File_open( MPI_COMM_WORLD, &quot;foo.txt&quot;, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;MPI_MODE_CREATE | MPI_MODE_WRONLY, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;MPI_INFO_NULL, &amp;fh );<br><br>&nbsp; MPI_File_write_ordered( fh, buff, 1, MPI_BYTE, &amp;status );<br><br>
