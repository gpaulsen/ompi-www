<br>
Ralph&#39;s point on the call today is that it doesn&#39;t matter *how* this problem is happening.  It *is* happening to real users, and so we need to account for it.<br>
<br>
But it really bothers me that we don&#39;t understand *how/why* this is happening (e.g., is this OMPI&#39;s fault somehow?  I don&#39;t think so, but then again, we don&#39;t understand how it&#39;s happening).  *Somewhere* in there, a shell is getting invoked.  But &quot;srun&quot; shouldn&#39;t be invoking a shell on the remote side -- it should be directly fork/exec&#39;ing the tokens with no shell interpretation at all.<br>

It seems to be a wrapper around the regular srun that runs a --task-prolog. What it does...that&#39;s beyond my ken, but I could ask. My guess is that it probably does something that helps keep our old PBS scripts running (sets $PBS_NODEFILE, say). We used to run PBS but switched to SLURM recently. The admins would, of course, prefer all future scripts be SLURM-native scripts, but there are a lot of production runs that uses many, many PBS scripts. Converting that would need slow, careful QC to make sure any &quot;pure SLURM&quot; versions act as expected.</div>
