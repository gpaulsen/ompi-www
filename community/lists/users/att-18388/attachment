<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I have a process that creates other processes at different times (using MPI_Comm_spawn). After, the initial process (creator of other processes) must receive mesagens of created processes. However, there are one intercommunicator for each created process. <BR>The question is: how to unite all the intercommunicator in a single&nbsp; communicator and receive the mesagens from this single comunicator?</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Thanks</DIV></td></tr></table>
