<body class='hmmessage'><div dir='ltr'>Hello Everyone,<br><br>I have attempted to upgrade my Open MPI to version 1.10.2 however after following the build steps on the FAQ page (https://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=building) I receive the following error at the top of every terminal I open, "mpicc: error while loading shared libraries: libopen-pal.so.13: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory". I have attached a compressed folder (.zip) that helps explain step-by-step what I did during installation. If anyone could spot what I did wrong or what I should try next to fix this problem I would greatly appreciate the help. Thank you to everyone in advance.<br><br>All the best,<br>Blair<br> 		 	   		  </div></body>
