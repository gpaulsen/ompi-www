<p>Hi all -</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been looking at the dynamic process features of mpi-2.  I have managed to actually launch processes using spawn, but haven&#39;t seen examples for actually communicating once these processes are launched.  I am additionally interested in how processes created through multiple spawn calls can communicate.</p>

<p>Does anyone know of resources that describe these topics?  My google-fu must not be up to par :)</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
