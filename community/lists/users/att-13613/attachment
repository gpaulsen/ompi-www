Cool.&nbsp; If you're building OpenMPI on 32-bit Windows as well, you won't
have any 64-bit switches to sort out.&nbsp; This part of my instructions:<br>
<br>
Visual Studio command prompt: "Start, All Programs, Visual
Studio 2008, Visual Studio Tools, Visual Studio 2008 Win64 x64 Command
Prompt" is slightly wrong for 32-bit Windows, there won't be a Win64
x64 prompt.&nbsp; There will be only one command prompt option on a 32-bit
install (use that), and CMake will have set you up with a 32-bit build
by default, so you'll be fine.&nbsp; Post back if you need help.<br>

You don't need to check anything alse in the red window, OpenMPI
doesn't know it's in a virtual machine.&nbsp; If you're running Windows in a
virtual cluster, are you running as 32-bit or 64-bit?&nbsp; <br>

That red window is what you should see after the first Configure step
in CMake. &nbsp;You need to do the next few steps in CMake and Visual Studio
to get a Windows OpenMPI build done. &nbsp;That's how CMake works. &nbsp;It's
complicated because CMake has to be able to build on multiple OSes so
what you do on each OS is different. &nbsp;Here's what to do:<br>
        <br>
As part of your original CMake setup, it will have asked you where to
put the CMake binaries. &nbsp;That's in "Where to build the binaries" line
in the main CMake window, at the top. &nbsp;Note that these binaries aren't
the OpenMPI binaries, they're the Visual Studio project files that
Visual Studio uses to build the OpenMPI binaries.<br>
        <br>
See the CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE line? &nbsp;It says Debug. &nbsp;Change Debug to Release
if you want a Release build (you probably do). &nbsp;Press the Configure
button again and let it run. &nbsp;That should be all clean. &nbsp;Now press the
Generate button. &nbsp;That will build the Visual Studio project files for
you. &nbsp;They'll go to the "Where to build the binaries" directory. &nbsp;From
here you're done with CMake.<br>
        <br>
Next you have two options. &nbsp;You can build from a command line, or from
within Visual Studio itself. &nbsp;For command-line instructions, read this:<br>
        <br>

 target="_blank">https://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/users/2010/02/12013.php</a><br>
        <br>
Note that you need to execute the devenv commands in that post from
within a Visual Studio command prompt: Start, All Programs, Visual
Studio 2008, Visual Studio Tools, Visual Studio 2008 Win64 x64 Command
Prompt. &nbsp;I'm assuming you want a 64-bit build. &nbsp;You need to be in that
"Where to build the binaries" directory as well.<br>
        <br>
To use Visual Studio directly, start Visual Studio, and open the
OpenMPI.sln project file that's in your "Where to build the binaries"
directory. &nbsp;In the Solution Explorer you'll see a list of sub-projects.
&nbsp;Right-click the top heading: Solution 'Open MPI' and select
Configuration Manager. &nbsp;You should get a window that says at the top
Active Solution Configuration, with Release below it. &nbsp;If it says
Debug, just change that to Release and it will flip all the
sub-projects over as well. &nbsp;Note on the the list of projects the
INSTALL project will not be checked. &nbsp;Check that now and close the
window. &nbsp; Now right-click Solution 'Open MPI' again and hit Build
Solution. &nbsp;It takes a while to compile everything. &nbsp;If you get errors
about error code -31 and mt.exe at the end of the build, that's your
virus scanner locking the new exe/dll files and the install project
complains. &nbsp;Keep right-clicking and Build Solution until it goes
through. &nbsp;The final Open MPI include files and binaries are in the
C:\Users\Alex's\Downloads......\installed directory.<br>

PS OpenMPI 1.4.2 doesn't have Fortran support on Windows. &nbsp;You need the
dev 1.5 series for that and a Fortran compiler.

I installed a 90 day trial of Visual Studio 2008, and I am pretty sure
I am getting the exact same thing. The log and the picture are attached
