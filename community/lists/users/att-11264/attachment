Hi,<br><br>I am new to Open MPI ( which is part of OFED-1.4 packege ). I have few basic queries about<br>Open MPI :<br><br>1) I am using openmpi-1.2.8 ( it is part of OFED-1.4 ). Is has two examples i) hello_c ii) ring_c<br>
    Does those examples work on Multiple machines or meant for a single node (i.e. localhost) ?<br>2) Does MPI_Send() and MPI_Recv() calls send message from process on one machine to <br>   process on another machine ? If yes, then how can I achieve this ?<br>
3) Does MPI APIs are implemented on the top of Infiniband ? Does MPI APIs uses Infiniband<br>   hardware and its module for sending and receiving data ?<br><br>Thanks in advance.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Vivek<br>
