Hi, <br><br>I have a Open MPI program, which works well on a Linux shared memory multicore (2 x 6 cores) machine.<br><br>But, it does not work well on a distributed cluster with Linux Open MPI.<br><br>I found that the the process sends out some messages to other processes, which can not receive them. <br><br>What is the possible reason ? <br><br>I do not change anything of the program. <br><br>Any help is really appreciated. <br><br>Thanks<br><br><br><br><br> 		 	   		  </div></body>
