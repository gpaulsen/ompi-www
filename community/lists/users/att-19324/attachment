    I think I found the answer to my question on Jeff Squyres&nbsp; blog:<br>

    However now I have a new question, how do I know if my machine uses
    the copyin/copyout mechanism or the direct mapping? <br>
    <br>
    Assuming that I am running on OpenMPI 1.5.x installed on top of a
    linux Kernel 2.6.32? <br>

      I would like to have a confirmation on the assumptions I have on
      how OpenMPI implements the rendezvous protocol for shared memory.
      <br>
      <br>
      If process A sends a message to process B and the eager protocol
      is used then I assume that the message is written into a shared
      memory area and picked up by the receiver when the receive
      operation is posted.
      <br>
      <br>
      When the rendezvous is utilized however the message still need to
      end up in the shared memory area somehow. I don't think any
      RDMA-like transfer exists for shared memory communications.
      Therefore you need to buffer this message somehow, however I
      assume that you don't buffer the whole thing but use some type of
      pipelined protocol so that you reduce the size of the buffer you
      need to keep in the shared memory.
      <br>
      <br>
      Is it completely wrong? It would be nice if someone could point me
      somewhere I can find more details about this. In the OpenMPI
      tuning page there are several details regarding the protocol
      utilized for IB but very little for SM.
      <br>

      thanks in advance,
      <br>
