<div>First of all, pardon me if this is a stupid comment; I am learning the nuts-and-bolts of parallel programming; but my comment is as follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Why can't this be done *outside* openMPI, by calling Linux's processor affinity APIs directly? I work with a blade server kind of archirecture, where each blade has 12 CPUs. I use pthread within each blade and MPI to talk across blades. I use the Linux system calls to attach a thread to a specific CPU and it seems to work fine. The only drawback is: it makes the code unportable to a different OS. But even if you implemented paffinity within openMPI, the code will still be unportable to a different implementation of MPI, which, as is, it is not.

<div>Hope this helps to the original poster.</div>
