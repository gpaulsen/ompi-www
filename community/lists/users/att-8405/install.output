    I am trying to install and test openmpi-1.2.9. I found that I could not use the Intel 11.0/.081 C++
and Fortran compilers although I think the problem is with these compilers not openmpi.  The openmpi-
1.2.9 did compile successfully with the internal compilers of SuSE 10.2.  However, at the end of the
"make all install" command output I noted that some of the make commands did not run  properly as
shown below.
    I tried to run some of the simple examples and was not successful.  For hello_c.c I received the
message "mpicc not found".  Is there a simple workaround?

    Any help would be appreciated.
