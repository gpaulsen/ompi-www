Hi all,<br><br>We have set up OpenMPI over a set of 5 machines (2 dual CPU) and get this error when trying to start an MPI application with more than 5 processes:<br><br>[0,1,2][btl_tcp_endpoint.c:572:mca_btl_tcp_endpoint_complete_connect] connect() failed with errno=113
<br><br>Anything below 5 proc. works great. We have set the btl_tcp_if_include and and the oob_tcp_include to the correct interface to use on each machine. Anything else we can try / diagnostics to run to provide more info about the problem?
<br><br>Thanks, Gunnar Johansson<br><br>
