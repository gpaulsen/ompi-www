<div>Hi all. I&#39;m a new open-mpi user. I&#39;ve downloaded the OpenMPI_v1.5.5-1_win32.exe file to install open-mpi on my dual-core windows 7 machine. I installed the file but now i can&#39;t compile my mpi programs. I use command below (in command prompt window) to compile my &#39;test.cpp&#39; program:</div>

<div> </div>
<div>&gt;&gt; mpic++ -o test test.cpp</div>
<div> </div>
<div>but i get error as follows:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>&gt;&gt; The open mpi wrapper compiler was unable to find the specified compiler cl.exe in your path.</div>
<div>     Note that this compiler was either specified at configure time or in one several possible environment variables.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>What is the problem? Is my compilation command right? Is there any remained necessary steps to complete my open-mpi installation?</div>
<div>Is it necessary to specify some environment variables?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks in advanced.</div>
