Dear all,<br><br>I am trying to run a C++ program which uses dynamic libraries under mpi.<br><br>The compilation command looks like:<br><br> mpiCC `pkg-config --cflags itpp`  -o montecarlo  montecarlo.cpp `pkg-config --libs itpp`<br>
<br>And it works if I executed it in one machine:<br><br>mpirun -np 2 -H localhost montecarlo<br><br>I tested this both in the &quot;master node&quot; and in the &quot;compute nodes&quot; and it works. However, when I try to run it with two different machines:<br>
<br>mpirun -np 2 -H localhost,hpcnode1 montecarlo<br><br>The program claims that it can&#39;t find the shared libraries:<br><br>montecarlo: error while loading shared libraries: libitpp.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory<br>
<br>The LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set properly at every machine, any idea where the problem is? I attached you the config.log and the result of the omp-info --all<br><br>Thank you in advance,<br><br>Miguel<br>
