Hi,<br><br>Thanks -- I downloaded the latest 1.4 snapshot after I saw your message and verified that this issue does not seem to occur in it. However, I ran into other stability issues (not necessarily surprising for a development snapshot). Is there any idea on when 1.3.4 will be out and if this fix will be migrated in?<br>
<br>Thanks again very much for your help.<br><br>Regards,<br>Tim<br><br><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Wed, Aug 26, 2009 at 6:07 PM, Ralph Castain <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:rhc@open-mpi.org">rhc@open-mpi.org</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br>

We know the problem does not exist in our devel trunk, but I don&#39;t know if the fix propagated to the 1.3 branch.<div>

Hello Everyone,<br>
<br>
I have a problem that I can&#39;t seem to figure out from searching the mailing list archive. I have a code that repeatedly spawns (via MPI_COMM_SPAWN) a group of 8 processes and then waits for them to finish. The problem is that OpenMPI (I&#39;ve tried 1.3.1 and 1.3.3) opens a pipe each time MPI_COMM_SPAWN is called, but this pipe never gets closed (even if I call MPI_COMM_FREE on both the parent and child). Therefore, eventually my master process hits the limit of open file descriptors and cannot spawn any more. I cannot figure out why this is happening since I am only spawning 8 jobs at a time.<br>

<br>
I should note that I don&#39;t exchange any data over the child intercommunicators -- they exist solely so I can call MPI_BARRIER on them (the spawned processes are programed to call MPI_BARRIER directly before they call MPI_FINALIZE, thus indicating that they are done doing their work).<br>

<br>
I&#39;d appreciate any suggestions as to what I might be doing wrong with this that is causing OpenMPI to hold the pipes open.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
Tim M.<br></div></div>
