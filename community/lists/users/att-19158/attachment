Hi, <br>
<br>
I am trying to execute OpenMPI and CUDA code on a cluster. The code works 
fine on single machine but when I try to execute it on cluster I get 
error: <br>
<br>
  error while loading shared libraries: libcudart.so.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory<br>
<br>
I checked my PATH and LD_PATH and it looks ok. I have a .bashrc file which contains following entries -<br>
  <br>
   export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/lib/:/usr/local/lib/openmpi:/usr/local/
cuda/bin<br>
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib:/usr/local/
lib/openmpi/:/usr/local/cuda/lib/:<br>
 <br>
All the machines haves same installation of CUDA and OpenMPI. <br>
<br>
Can anyone help me with this. <br><br>This problem is really annoying.<br>
<br>
Thanks.
