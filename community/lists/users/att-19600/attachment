Hi,<div><br></div><div>I would like to start a single process without mpirun and then use MPI_Comm_spawn to start up as many processes as required. I don&#39;t want the parent process to take up any resources, so I tried to disconnect the inter communicator and then finalize mpi and exit the parent. But as soon as I do that the children exit too. Why is that? Can I somehow change that behavior? Or can I wait on the children to exit without the waiting taking up CPU time?</div>

<div><br></div><div>The reason I don&#39;t need the parent as soon as the children are spawned, is that I need one intra-communicator over all processes. And as far as I know I cannot join the parent and children to one intra-communicator. </div>

<div><br></div><div>The purpose of the whole exercise is that I want that my program to use all cores of a node by default when executed without mpirun.</div><div><br></div><div>I have tested this with OpenMPI 1.4.5. A sample program is here: <a href="http://pastebin.com/g2XSZwvY">http://pastebin.com/g2XSZwvY</a> . &quot;Child finalized&quot; is only printed with the sleep(2) in the parent not commented out.</div>
