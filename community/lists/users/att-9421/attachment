I am very new to the concept of MPI, and have only recently begun researching it.  I have a very basic question about the way MPI works.  <br><br>How exactly does MPI distribute user-created applications (binary code) over a network?  Does it actually copy the binary into the local memory of each node, and execute it?  If so, doesn&#39;t this put serious restrictions on the heterogeneity of the network?  For example, in order to run a distributed application (compiled with gcc) over a typical Linux cluster, you&#39;d need to make sure that each node has the same version of glibc, or there could be issues running the binary.  <br>
<br>Any information would be greatly appreciated.<br>
