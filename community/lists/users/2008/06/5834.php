Jeff,
<br>
<p>I believe that with quicktime-pro you can export the videos in  
<br>
several formats.

<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I've never really dig into Open MPI's guts, not because I wasn't
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; interested, but mainly because the time required to get my bearings
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; seemed just too much. Until now. I've watched a couple of the videos
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; while coding and it was pretty awesome. Easy to understand,  
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; structured
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and well spoken.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; Good!  I'm glad you've found them useful.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; - Do you like the format?
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;     - Is the (slides+narration) format useful?
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Yes, I like it a lot. I guess a pure podcast would be insufficient  
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; for
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; complex issues where you simply need diagrams.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; That was definitely my thought here -- pictures can be worth a million
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; words, etc.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Maybe a small
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; suggestion: maybe it's just me, but I'd actually prefer (even) leaner
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; slides. Currently you're basically duplicating on screen what you're
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; saying, which is good when you're a nervous, moumbling college  
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; student
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and might lose your audience somewhere. But when you're an experenced
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; speaker (which you obviously are), the audience does rarely need this
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; redundancy and might rather get confused when trying to digest both
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; streams of information (visual and auditory) simultaneously. But this
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is of course a question of personal preference.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; Thanks for the compliment snuggled in there.  :-)
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, this might be a style thing -- I have found that at least some
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; people like to have slides that are more-or-less what the speaker
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; actually said for two reasons:
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; - so that the visuals and audio agree with each other -- it's not two
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; different through processes while you're trying to absorb the
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; information.  Sure, some people read ahead on the slide and get bored
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; because the speaker eventually catches up, but at least in my
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; experience, these people are a minority.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; - more importantly, however, the audience likes to take the slides
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; away and when they actually look at them 6 weeks after the lecture,
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; they might actually remember the content better because they received
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; the same information via two forms of sensory input (audio + visual).
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;     - Would terminal screen-scrape sessions be useful?
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I'd prefer how-to pages for this, as you can copy&amp;paste the commands
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; directly into your own shell.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; Good point.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;     - ...other [low-budget] suggestions?
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Maybe an a tad higher audio bitrate. And some people don't like the
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; .mov format, but that isn't really important.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; Ok, I can bump up the audio rate and see what happens to the filesize
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; (that was my prime concern, actually).  Plus it *is* just the builtin
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; microphone on my Mac, so it may not be the greatest sound quality to
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; begin with.  :-)
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; As for .mov, yes, this is definitely a compromise.  I tried uploading
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; the videos to YouTube and Google Video and a few others, but a) most
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; have a time or file size restriction (e.g., 10 mins max) -- I was not
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; willing to spend the extra work to split up the videos into multiple
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; segments, and b) they down-res'ed the videos so much as to make the
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; slides look crappy and/or unreadable.  So I had to go with the video
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; encoder that I could get for darn little money (Cisco's a big company,
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; but my budget is still tiny :-) ).  That turned out to be a fun little
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; program called iShowU for OS X that does screen scraping + audio
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; capture.  It outputs Quicktime movies, so that was really my only
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; choice.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; Is it a real hardship for people to install the QT player?  Are there
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; easy-to-install convertors?  I'm not opposed to hosting it in multiple
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; formats if it's easy and free to convert them.
