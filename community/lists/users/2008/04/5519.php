<p><p>I understand and agree (my text was mainly trying to give  
<br>
justification of why we are where we are in terms of the existing  
<br>
README file -- not necessarily that I disagree with what you are  
<br>
saying).
<br>
<p>I was trying to ask if you had a few concrete examples in mind, since  
<br>
you're our most recent newbie -- most of us have been doing this for  
<br>
so long that it's all &quot;obvious&quot; to us, which puts us in a bad position  
<br>
to try to write documentation for those who are new to the concepts,  
<br>
etc.  Another issue that I have seen is that &quot;common&quot; configurations  
<br>
are a misnomer -- what is &quot;common&quot; for one user is not for another.  :-(
<br>
<p>My point: can you think of a few concrete examples of configure lines  
<br>
that would have been helpful for you to see in the README?  What  
<br>
concepts would you wanted to have seen as a newbie?
