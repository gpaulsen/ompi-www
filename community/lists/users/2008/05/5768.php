I've never really dig into Open MPI's guts, not because I wasn't
<br>
interested, but mainly because the time required to get my bearings
<br>
seemed just too much. Until now. I've watched a couple of the videos
<br>
while coding and it was pretty awesome. Easy to understand, structured
<br>
and well spoken.

<p>Yes, I like it a lot. I guess a pure podcast would be insufficient for
<br>
complex issues where you simply need diagrams. Maybe a small
<br>
suggestion: maybe it's just me, but I'd actually prefer (even) leaner
<br>
slides. Currently you're basically duplicating on screen what you're
<br>
saying, which is good when you're a nervous, moumbling college student
<br>
and might lose your audience somewhere. But when you're an experenced
<br>
speaker (which you obviously are), the audience does rarely need this
<br>
redundancy and might rather get confused when trying to digest both
<br>
streams of information (visual and auditory) simultaneously. But this
<br>
is of course a question of personal preference.
<br>

</span><br>
<p>I'd prefer how-to pages for this, as you can copy&amp;paste the commands
<br>
directly into your own shell.
<br>
<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt;      - ...other [low-budget] suggestions?
</span><br>
<p>Maybe an a tad higher audio bitrate. And some people don't like the
<br>
.mov format, but that isn't really important. 
<br>
<p>Thanks!
