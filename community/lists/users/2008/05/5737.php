<p>
Over the past year or two, I have been slowly creating a large set of  
<br>
Open MPI training material that I've used to present to my company's  
<br>
customers and partners.  I have just recently received permission to  
<br>
release all of my slides to the greater HPC community.  Woo hoo!
<br>
<p>Note that &quot;receiving permission&quot; is very different than receiving  
<br>
funding or additional staff to publish said training material.  :-)   
<br>
So I chose a very low-budget method to publish this material:  
<br>
recording video+audio of me talking through my training slides (screen- 
<br>
scraping the slides from my laptop's screen).  Each video is me  
<br>
narrating a [relatively] small chunk of slides on a specific sub-topic:
<br>
<p>1. What is MPI? What is Open MPI?
<br>
2. Basic Architecture and Tuning
<br>
3. OpenFabrics Concepts
<br>
4. Open MPI OpenFabrics Protocols (v1.2 series)
<br>
5. Tuning the Openib BTL (v1.2 series)
<br>
6. Openib BTL v1.3 Sneak Peak
<br>
<p>Hopefully you'll find this information useful.
<br>
<p>These videos are somewhat of a test.  Do users find them useful?  I  
<br>
have other material that I could cover (i.e., more slides), and ideas  
<br>
for additonal formats (e.g., terminal screen-scrapes showing actual  
<br>
OMPI usage, demonstrating specific concepts), and others in the OMPI  
<br>
group may be motivated to make some of these if users find them  
<br>
useful.  We'd love to hear some feedback on the Open MPI users'  
<br>
mailing list (keeping in mind that these are [very] low-budget  
<br>
productions):
<br>
<p>- Do you like these videos / are they useful to you?
<br>
- Do you like the format?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Is the (slides+narration) format useful?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Would terminal screen-scrape sessions be useful?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- ...other [low-budget] suggestions?
<br>
- Do you have recommendations for specific topics that you would like  
<br>
to see?
