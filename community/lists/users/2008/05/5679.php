Hello Everybody,
<br>
<p>i got a little bit annoying situation with OMPI error messages
<br>
on a RHEL 4-something box. Every time i should see a error
<br>
message i recieve something like:
<br>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------
<br>
Sorry!  You were supposed to get help about:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;orterun:init-failure
<br>
from the file:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;help-orterun.txt
<br>
But I couldn't find any file matching that name.  Sorry!
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>i know that the help-files (and only the help-files not
<br>
the whole installation) are located in:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;/usr/share/openmpi/1.2.3-gcc/help64/openmpi/*
<br>
<p>Is it possible to tell OMPI to look for the help files
<br>
in this direcotry ? Some ENV variable or a --option ?
<br>
<p>Thank you in advance, Alex
<br>
