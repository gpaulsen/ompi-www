CALL FOR PAPERS
<br>
<p>3rd Workshop on Virtualization in High-Performance Cluster
<br>
and Grid Computing (VHPC'08)
<br>
<p>as part of Euro-Par 2008, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Canary Island,
<br>
Spain
<br>
<p>===============================================================
<br>
<p><p>Date: August 26-29, 2008
<br>
<p>Euro-Par 2008: <a href="http://europar2008.caos.uab.es/">http://europar2008.caos.uab.es/</a>
<br>
Workshop URL: <a href="http://xhpc.wu-wien.ac.at/">http://xhpc.wu-wien.ac.at/</a>
<br>
<p><p>SUBMISSION DEADLINE:
<br>
Abstracts: February 4, 2008
<br>
Full Paper: April 14, 2008
<br>
<p><p>Scope:
<br>
Virtual machine monitors (VMMs) are becoming tightly integrated with
<br>
standard OS distributions, leading to increased adoption in many
<br>
application areas including scientific educational and high-performance
<br>
computing (HPC). VMMs allow for the concurrent execution of potentially
<br>
large numbers of virtual machines, providing encapsulation, isolation,
<br>
and the possibility for migrating VMs between physical hosts. These
<br>
features enable physical clusters to be treated as &quot;computation pools&quot;,
<br>
where a variety of execution environments can be dynamically
<br>
instantiated on the underlying hardware. VM technology is therefore
<br>
opening up new architectures and services for HPC in cluster and grid
<br>
environments, but consensus has not yet emerged on the best models
<br>
and tools. This workshop aims to bring together researchers and
<br>
practitioners working on virtualization in HPC environments, with the
<br>
goal of sharing experience and promoting the development of a
<br>
research community in this emerging area.
<br>
<p>The workshop will be one day in length, composed of 20 min paper
<br>
presentations, each followed by 10 min discussion sections.
<br>
Presentations may be accompanied by interactive demonstrations.
<br>
The workshop will also include a 30 min panel discussion by presenters.
<br>
<p><p><p><p>TOPICS
<br>

<br>
<p><p>PAPER SUBMISSION
<br>
<p>Papers submitted to each workshop will be reviewed by at least two
<br>
members of the program committee and external reviewers. Submissions
<br>
should include abstract, key words, the e-mail address of the
<br>
corresponding author, and must not exceed 10 pages, including tables
<br>
and figures at a main font size no smaller than 11 point. Submission
<br>
of a paper should be regarded as a commitment that, should the paper be
<br>
accepted, at least one of the authors will register and attend the
<br>
conference to present the work.
<br>
<p>Accepted papers will be published in the Springer LNCS series - the
<br>
format must be according to the Springer LNCS Style. Initial
<br>
submissions are in PDF, accepted papers will be requested to
<br>
provided source files.
