    Hi,<br>
    <br>
    I am trying to use gprof with my mpi code. I googled and saw this
    msg:<br>
    <br>
    Open-MPI and gprof:<br>
    <br>
    <i>Yes you can profile MPI applications by compiling with -pg.
      However, by <br>
    </i>
    <p><i>
        default each process will produce an output file called
        "gmon.out", <br>
        which is a problem if all processes are writing to the same
        global file <br>
        system (i.e. all processes will try to write to the same file).
        <br>
      </i>
    </p>
    <p><i>There is an undocumented feature of gprof that allows you to
        specify the <br>
        filename for profiling output via the environment variable <br>
        GMON_OUT_PREFIX. For example, one can set this variable in the
        .bashrc <br>
        file for every node to insure unique profile filenames, i.e.:
        <br>
      </i>
    </p>
    <p><i>export GMON_OUT_PREFIX='gmon.out-'`/bin/uname -n`
        <br>
      </i>
    </p>
    <p><i>The filename will appear as GMON_OUT_PREFIX.pid, where pid is
        the <br>
        process id on a given node (so this will work when multiple
        nodes are <br>
        contained in a single host).
      </i><br>
    </p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>However, this msg was written in 2009. I wonder if it is still
      the same method. Also, in that case, if i run on 10 cpus, I will
      have 10 such outputs. Is it possible to get an average result
      instead of individual results?<br>
    </p>
    <p>I run the mpi code but without using the above instructions and
      got just 1 file - gmon.out. Does it mean that this result is for
      the current node?<br>
    </p>
    Thank you!<br>
