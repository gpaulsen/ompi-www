Hi all -<br><br>I have been using OpenMPI for quite a while now, and its working out great.&nbsp; I was looking at the FAQ and trying to figure out how to configure OpenMPI with infiniband.&nbsp; It shows how to enable IB pointing to the OFED directory.
<br><br>I have infiniband built into the kernel, along with IP over IB and with the Mellanox drivers.&nbsp; What would I still need to install, and how would I configure OpenMPI to work with this?<br><br>Thanks,<br>&nbsp; Brian<br>
