I run my openmpi-based application in a multi-node cluster.&nbsp; There is also a sniffer computer (installed with wireshark) attached to a listener port on the switch to sniff any packets.<br><br>However I would like to know the protocol (UDP or TCP) as well as the ports used by openmpi for interprocess communication so that wireshark can only capture these packets.
<br><br>Thanks!<br>
