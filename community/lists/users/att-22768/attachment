<div dir="ltr"><div><div><p>Hi,<br></p><p>I&#39;m facing a  performance issue with a scientific 
application(Fortran). The issue is, it runs faster on single node but 
runs very slow on multiple nodes. For example, a 16 core job on single node
 finishes in 1hr 2mins, but the same job on two nodes (i.e. 8 cores per 
node &amp; remaining 8 cores kept free) takes 3hr 20mins. The code is 
compiled with ifort-13.1.1, openmpi-1.4.5 and intel MKL libraries - 
lapack, blas, scalapack, blacs &amp; fftw. What could be the problem 
here with?</p>Is it possible to do any tuning in OpenMPI? FY More info: The cluster has Intel Sandybridge processor (E5-2670), 
infiniband and Hyperthreading is Enabled. Jobs are submitted thru LSF 
scheduler.<br><br></div>Does HyperThreading causing any problem here?<br><br><br></div><div>Thanks</div></div>
