Ok. <br>
So it is only useful to use compression in narrow special cases.<br>
Thanks for info.<br>

    <pre wrap="">Actually, even in this particular condition (over internet)1  
compression make sense only for very specific data. The problem is  
that usually the compression algorithm is very expensive if you want  
to really get a interesting factor of size reduction. And there is  
the tradeoff, what you save in terms of data transfer you lose in  
terms of compression time. In other terms, the compression became  
interesting in only 2 scenarios: you have a very congested network  
(really very very congested) or you have a network with a limited  
bandwidth.

The algorithm use in the paper you cited is fast, but unfortunately  
very specific for MPI_DOUBLE and only works if the data exhibit the  
properties I cited in my previous email. The generic compression  
algorithms are at least one order of magnitude slower. And then  
again, one needs a very slow network in order to get any benefits  
from doing the compression ... And of course slow networks is not  
exactly the most common place where you will find MPI applications.

But as Jeff stated in his email, contributions are always welcomed :)

Now of course, if one limit itself to very regular applications  
(such as the one presented in the paper), where the matrices  
involved in the computation are well conditioned (such as in the  
paper), and if you only use MPI_DOUBLE (\cite{same_paper}), and  
finally if you only expect to run over slow Ethernet (1Gbs)  
(\cite{same_paper_again})... then yes one might get some benefit.

      <pre wrap="">Yes, you are probably right that its not worth the effort in  
general and
especially not in HPC environments where you have very fast network.

But I can think of (rather important) special cases where it is  
important

- non HPC environments with slow network: beowulf clusters and/or
 internet + normal PCs where you use existing workstations and  
network
 for computations.
- communication/io-bound computations where you transfer
 large redundant datasets between nodes

So it would be nice to be able to turn on the compression (for spefic
communicators and/or data transfers) when you need it.

I read from somewhere that OpenMPI supports
some kind of data compression but I couldn't find
any information about it.

Is this true and how it can be used?

Does anyone have any experiences about using it?

Is it possible to use compression in just some
subset of communications (communicator
specific compression settings)?

In our MPI application we are transferring large
amounts of sparse/redundant data that compresses
very well. Also my initial tests showed significant
improvements in performance.

There are also articles that suggest that compression
should be used [1].
