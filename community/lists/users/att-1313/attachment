<HTML><BODY style="word-wrap: break-word; -khtml-nbsp-mode: space; -khtml-line-break: after-white-space; ">Actually there was further output.

Meanwhile I'm going to try using fink as someone suggested g9 from that route might work.<DIV><BR class="khtml-block-placeholder"></DIV><DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
