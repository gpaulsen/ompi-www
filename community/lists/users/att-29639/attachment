<div dir="ltr">IBM will be helping to support the LSF functionality in Open MPI. We don&#39;t have any detailed documentation just yet, other than the FAQ on the Open MPI site. However, the LSF components in Open MPI should be functional in the latest releases. I&#39;ve tested recently with LSF 9.1.3 and 10.1.<div><br></div><div>I pushed some changes to the Open MPI 1.10.3 release (and 2.0.0 pre-release) for affinity support in MPMD configurations. That was tested on machine with LSF 9.1.3. This is using the the &quot;-R&quot; affinity options to bsub - so the affinity specification mechanism built into LSF. It worked as I expected it to for the few configurations I tried.</div><div><br></div><div>I have not tested with v1.8 series since it&#39;s an older series. I would suggest trying the 1.10.3 release (and the soon to be released 2.0.0) on your system.</div><div><br></div></div><div class="gmail_extra"><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Fri, Jul 8, 2016 at 1:20 PM, Gang Chen <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:gchengordon@gmail.com" target="_blank">gchengordon@gmail.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex"><div dir="ltr">Hi,<div><br></div><div>I am wondering if there&#39;s integration test conducted with v1.8.8 and IBM LSF 9.1.3 or 10.1, especially the cpu affinity parts.
