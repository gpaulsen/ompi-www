&gt; I understand that using Portland compiler isn&#39;t &quot;advised&quot; by Open Mpi, i was just wondering if there&#39;s a way of doing it, since i need Open Mpi compiled with PG fortran and not gfortran for example.<br>
<br>
A further clarification: the Portland compiler is a fine compiler; we certainly support it.  The only thing we recommend is avoiding mixing compiler suites whenever possible (e.g., using one compiler for C and another for Fortran).  It leads to complications like this.<br>
<br>
That being said, it looks like you have a Portland Fortran license, and no corresponding Portland C license, and therefore you&#39;re somewhat forced into this situation.<br>
<br>
&gt; The name of the binary is correct: pgf90 the name of the file is also correct .pgf90.rc i do have some doubts about the content of the file. Is this enough?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; switch -pthread is replace(-lpthread) positional(linker)<br>
<br>
I&#39;m not a Portland customer -- I don&#39;t know.  You&#39;ll need to check their documentation.<br>
<br>
&gt; If i do a source .pgf90.rc i do get errors:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; -bash: ./.pgf90.rc: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token `(&#39;<br>
&gt; -bash: ./.pgf90.rc: line 1: `switch -pthread is replace(-lpthread) positional(linker)&#39;<br>
<br>
I&#39;m guessing that this file is not intended to be sourced by the shell, but rather noticed and read/used by the pgf90 compiler when it is invoked.<br>
<br>
Sidenote: isn&#39;t there a pgfortran compiler executable that is supposed to be preferred over &quot;pgf90&quot; these days?  (remember my disclaimer: I&#39;m not a Portland customer, so I could be totally off base here...)  Have you tried pgfortran to see if it accepts the -pthread option?  Sometimes the different compiler executable entry points behave slightly differently...<br>
<br>
&gt; Besides that i tried what you mentioned: pgf90 -pthread somefile.f90 , and that gives the expected error:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; pgf90 -pthread helloworld.f90<br>
&gt; pgf90-Error-Unknown switch: -pthread<br>
<br>
Sounds like this file is somehow not yet correct, or you have a version of the Portland compiler that does not use this config file.  You should check the Portland Fortran compiler documentation.<br>
<br>
If you can&#39;t get this Portland config file workaround to work, you can also make your own &quot;my_fortran_compiler&quot; script that simply strips out the -pthread argv token and then invokes pgf90 (or pgfortran) with the rest of the argv.  Then you can:<br>
<br>
./configure FC=my_fortran_compiler ...<br>
<br>
I.e., you&#39;re just intercepting Open MPI&#39;s invocation of the Fortran compiler, removing the CLI option that pgf90(pgfortran) won&#39;t understand, and then invoking pgf90(pgfortran).  Make sense?<br>
<br>
&gt; My real question is, can i change Open Mpi configuration, to not use -pthread flag on fortran compiler?<br>
<br>
I&#39;m sorry, no -- Open MPI requires threading support.<br>
