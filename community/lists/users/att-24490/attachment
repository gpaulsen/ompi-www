However, I'm a little concerned about the use of the prerelease version of Slurm as we know that PMI is having some problems over there.<div><br></div><div>So out of curiosity - how was this job launched? Via mpirun or directly using srun?</div><div><br></div><div><br><div><div>On May 27, 2014, at 1:22 AM, Filippo Spiga &lt;<a href="mailto:spiga.filippo@gmail.com">spiga.filippo@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:</div><br class="Apple-interchange-newline"><blockquote type="cite"><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html charset=iso-8859-1"><div style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">Dear all,<div><br></div>I am using Open MPI v1.8.2 night snapshot compiled with SLURM support (version 14.03pre5).&nbsp;These two messages below appeared during a job of 2048 MPI that died after 24 hours!&nbsp;<div><br></div><div><font face="Andale Mono">[warn] Epoll ADD(1) on fd 0 failed. &nbsp;Old events were 0; read change was 1 (add); write change was 0 (none): Operation not permitted<br><br></font></div><div><font face="Andale Mono">[warn] Epoll ADD(4) on fd 2 failed. &nbsp;Old events were 0; read change was 0 (none); write change was 1 (add): Operation not permitted</font><br><br><div><br class="webkit-block-placeholder"></div><div>The first one, appeared immediately at the beginning had no effect. The application started to compute and it successfully called a big parallel eigensolver. The second message appeared after 18~19 hours of non-stop computation and the application crashed without showing any other error message! Regularly I was checking that MPI processes were not stuck, after this message the processes were all aborted without dumping anything on stdout/stderr. It is quite weird.</div><div><br></div><div>I believe these messages come from Open MPI (but correct me if I am wrong!). I am going to look at the application and the various libraries to find out if something is wrong.
