<div dir="ltr">Hi guys,<br><br>&nbsp; I was hoping someone here could shed some light on OpenMPI&#39;s use of /tmp (or, I guess, TMPDIR) and save me from diving into the source.. ;)<br><br>&nbsp; The background is that I&#39;m trying to run some applications on a system which has a flaky parallel file system which TMPDIR is mapped to - so, on start up, OpenMPI creates it&#39;s &#39;openmpi-sessions-&lt;user&gt;&#39; directory there, and under that, a few files.&nbsp; Sometimes I see 1 subdirectory (usually a 0), sometimes a 0 and a 1, etc.&nbsp; In one of these, sometimes I see files such as &#39;shared_memory_pool.&lt;host&gt;&#39;, and &#39;shared_memory_module.&lt;host&gt;&#39;.<br>
<br>&nbsp; My questions are, one, what are the various numbers / files for?&nbsp; (If there&#39;s a write-up on this somewhere, just point me towards it!)<br><br>&nbsp; And two, the real question, are these &#39;files&#39; used during runtime, or only upon startup / shutdown?&nbsp; I&#39;m having issues with various codes, especially those heavy on messages and I/O, failing to complete a run, and haven&#39;t resorted to sifting through strace&#39;s output yet.&nbsp; This doesn&#39;t happen all the time, but I&#39;ve seen it happen reliably now with one particular code - it&#39;s success rate (it DOES succeed sometimes) is about 25% right now.&nbsp; My best guess is that this is because the file system is overloaded, thus not allowing timely I/O or access to OpenMPI&#39;s files, but I wanted to get a quick understanding of how these files are used by OpenMPI and whether the FS does indeed seem a likely culprit before going with that theory for sure.<br>
<br>&nbsp; Thanks very much,<br>&nbsp; - Brian<br><br><br>Brian Dobbins<br>Yale Engineering HPC<br></div>
