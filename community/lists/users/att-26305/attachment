<div dir="ltr">I have two systems A (aka Host) and B (aka Target). On A a compiler suite is installed (intel 14.0.2), on B there is no compiler. I want to compile openmpi on A for running it on system B (in particular, I want to use mpirun and mpif90), so I want to have static linking to the intel libraries.
