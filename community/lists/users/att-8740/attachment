OpenMPI has had that since the 1.2 line. </small></small><br>

George, you should have thought about that.&nbsp; I understand your
eagerness to share this exciting news, but perhaps an April-1st
announcement detracted from the seriousness of this grand development.

  <br>
Here's another desirable MPI feature.&nbsp; People talk about "error
detection/correction".&nbsp; We should do that in MPI.&nbsp; Decide what the user
*meant* to do, and do that "under the hood" rather than what they
actually programmed.&nbsp; Now, *that* would be a competitive advantage!&nbsp;
(E.g., I'm spending a lot of time trying to get good latency
measurements... why can't OMPI just detect that and give me good
latency measurements!)

release of the "unbreakable" / bug-free version Open MPI 2009,

(expected to be available by mid-2011).&nbsp; This release is essentially a

complete rewrite of Open MPI based on new technologies such as C#,

Java, and object-oriented Cobol (so say we all!).&nbsp; Buffer overflows
      <br>
and memory leaks are now things of the past.&nbsp; We strongly recommend

that all users upgrade to Windows 7 to fully take advantage of the new

powers embedded in Open MPI.
