<div id=":1xh">Can anyone tell me whether it is legal to pass zero values for some of the send count elements in an MPI_AlltoallV() call? I want to perform an all-to-all operation but for performance reasons do not want to send data to various ranks who don't need to receive any useful values. If it is legal, can I assume the implementation is smart enough to not send messages when the send count is 0?<br>

FYI: my tests show that AlltoallV operations with various send count values set to 0...hangs.<br></div></blockquote></div><br><div>This is allowed by the standard, but be warned that it is likely to perform poorly compared to what could be done with point-to-point or one-sided operations if most links are empty.</div>
