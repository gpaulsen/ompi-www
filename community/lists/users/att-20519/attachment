Hi all,<br><br>I am having issue running ompi-clean which clean up (this is normal) session associated to a user which means it kills all running jobs assoicated to this session (this is also normal). But I would like to be able to clean up session associated to a job (a not user).<br>
<br>Here is my point:<br><br>I am running two executable :<br><br> % mpirun -np 2 myexec1<br>       --&gt; run with PID 2399 ...<br> % mpirun -np 2 myexec2<br>       --&gt; run with PID 2402 ...<br><br>When I run orte-clean I got this result :<br>
 % orte-clean -v<br> orte-clean: cleaning session dir tree openmpi-sessions-ndelader@myhost_0<br> orte-clean: killing any lingering procs<br> orte-clean: found potential rogue orterun process (pid=2399,user=ndelader), sending SIGKILL...<br>
 orte-clean: found potential rogue orterun process (pid=2402,user=ndelader), sending SIGKILL...<br><br>Which means that both jobs have been killed :-(<br>Basically I would like to perform orte-clean using executable name or PID or whatever that identify which job I want to stop an clean. It seems I would need to create an openmpi session per job. Does it make sense ? And I would like to be able to do something like following command and get following result :<br>
<br>  % orte-clean -v myexec1<br>
 orte-clean: cleaning session dir tree openmpi-sessions-ndelader@myhost_0<br>
 orte-clean: killing any lingering procs<br>
 orte-clean: found potential rogue orterun process (pid=2399,user=ndelader), sending SIGKILL...<br><br><br>Does it make sense ? Is there a way to perform this kind of selection in cleaning process ?<br><br>Regards,<br>Nicolas<br>
