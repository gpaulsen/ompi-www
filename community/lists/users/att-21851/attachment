<div dir="ltr">Hi everyone,<div><br></div><div style>I want to install OpenMPI on LSF cluster in our organization. I am not proficient with Linux/LSF, and some of my questions might be from lack of understanding of the system, and not related to OpenMPI directly.</div>
<div style><br></div><div style>So far I found these bits of information on the site of OpenMPI</div><div style><br></div><div style><b>1.</b> <b>OpenMPI support for 1.6 seems to be broken, and was fixed maybe in 1.7?</b></div>

<div style><b><br></b></div><div style><b>1</b>. What is the latest stable version that is known to integrate in a native way with LSF?</div><div style><b>2</b>. When building with LSF support, in what directory should I run the ./configure and makes scripts from? Should I be logined into one of the hosts of LSF cluster? </div>
<div style><b>3</b>. Will these scripts copy openmpi shared libraries into each host on the cluster? </div><div style><b>4</b>. Where will the mpi compiler be after the installation? What include pathes and libraries should I add to my C++ project to compile a simple MPI program?</div>
