Dear all,<div><br></div><div>I want to automatically checkpoint an MPI program with OpenMPI ( I&#39;m currently using 1.4.2 version with BLCR 0.8.2), </div><div>not by manually typing ompi-checkpoint command line from another terminal.</div>

<div>So I would like to know if there is a way to call checkpoint function from inside an MPI program </div><div>with OpenMPI or how to do that.</div><div>Any ideas are very appreciated.</div><div><br></div><div>Regards,</div>
