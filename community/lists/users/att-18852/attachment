<br clear="all">Hi Edgar.<br><br>Thanks for the response. I just did not understand why the Barrier works before I remove one of the client processes.<br><br>I tryed it with 1 server and 3 clients and it worked properly. After I removed 1 of the clients, it stops working. So, the removal is affecting the functionality of Barrier, I guess.<br>
<br>Anyone has an idea?<br>
