<br>
I tested a simple hello world program on 5 nodes each with dual<br>
quad-core processors. I noticed that openmpi does not always follow<br>
the order of the processors indicated in the machinefile. Depending<br>
upon the number of processors requested, openmpi does some type of<br>
sorting to find the best node fit for a particular job and runs on<br>
them.  Is there a way to make openmpi to turn off this sorting and<br>
strictly follow the order indicated in the machinefile?<br>
<br>
mpiexec supports three options to specify the machinefile -<br>
default-machinefile, hostfile, and machinefile. Can anyone tell what<br>
is the difference between these three options?<br>
<br>
Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
Rajesh<br>
