I&#39;ve tried on my home Ubuntu 10.04, 64 bit version. It crashes with number of ranks 5-7, 9 and greater. I simply downloaded 1.4.3 version (<a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v1.4/downloads/openmpi-1.4.3.tar.gz">http://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v1.4/downloads/openmpi-1.4.3.tar.gz</a>):<br>
<br>- configure --prefix=`pwd`/install &amp;&amp; make install<br>- cd ~/projects/gather<br>- ~/projects/distribs/openmpi-1.4.3/install/bin/mpicc -o gather ./gather.c<br>- ~/projects/distribs/openmpi-1.4.3/install/bin/mpirun -n 9 ./gather<br>
- crash!<br><br>-Andrew<br><br><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Wed, May 25, 2011 at 10:48 PM, Andrew Senin <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:andrew.senin@itseez.com">andrew.senin@itseez.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); padding-left: 1ex;">
Not exactly. I have 16 core nodes. Even if I run all 9 ranks on the same<br>
node it fails (with --mca btl sm,self). I also tried running on different<br>
nodes (3 nodes, 3 ranks each on each node) with openib and tcp - the same<br>
effect. Also as I wrote in another message I could see this effect on vbox<br>
with CentOS 5.3 (1 cores on guest, 4 cores on host, no network). So possibly<br>
this is something OS specific? Will try on Ubuntu and share the results.<br>
