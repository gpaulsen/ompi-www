Hi,<br><br>I am using Openmpi (version 1.2.2) for MPI data transfer
using non-blocking MPI calls like MPI_Isend, MPI_Irecv etc. I am using
&quot;--mca btl_tcp_if_include eth0,eth1&quot; to use both the eth link for data
transfer within 48 nodes.  Now I have added eth2 and eth3 links on the
32 compute nodes. My aim is to share the high speed data within 32
compute nodes through eth2 and eth3. But I can&#39;t include this as part
of &quot;mca&quot; as the rest of 16 nodes do not have these additional
interfaces. In MPI/Openmp can one specify explicit routing table within
a set of nodes? Such that I can edit /etc/host for additional hostname
with these new interfaces and add these hosts in the mpi hostfile. <br>
