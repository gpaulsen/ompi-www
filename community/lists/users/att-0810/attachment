Attached are output files from a build with the adjustments you
suggested.<br>

setenv FC pgf90<br>
setenv F77 pgf90<br>
setenv CCPFLAGS -I/usr/include/gm&nbsp; <br>
<br>
./configure&nbsp; --prefix=/users/rosmond/ompi&nbsp; --with-gm<br>
<br>
The results are the same.<br>
<br>
P.S.&nbsp; I understand that the mpi2 option is just a dummy.&nbsp; I use it
because I am <br>
porting a code from an SGI Origin, which has full mpi2 one-sided
support.&nbsp; This<br>
options makes it unnecessary to add my own dummy MPI2 routines to my
source.<br>
My code has both MPI1 and MPI2 message passing options, so it's one of
the <br>
reasons I like OPENMPI over MPICH.<br>

Can you try configuring with --with-gm (no argument) and send the  
output from configure and make again?  The --with-gm flag takes as an  
argument the installation prefix, not the library prefix.  So in this  
case, it would be --with-gm=/usr, which is kind of pointless, as  
that's a default search location anyway.  Open MPI's configure script  
should automatically look in /usr/lib64.  In fact, it looks like  
configure looked there and found the right libgm, but something went  
amuck later in the process.

Also, you really don't want to configure with the --enable-mpi2-one- 
sided flag.  It will not do anything useful and will likely cause  
very bad things to happen.  Open MPI 1.0.x does not have any MPI-2  
onesided support.  Open MPI 1.1 should have a complete implementation  
of the onesided chapter.

I assume you mean CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/include/gm, which shouldn't cause  
any problems.

    <pre wrap="">The configure seemed to go OK, but the make failed.  As you see at  
the end of the
make output, it doesn't like the format of libgm.so.  It looks to  
me that it is using
a path (/usr/lib/.....) to 32 bit libraries, rather than 64 bit (/ 
usr/lib64/....).   Is this
correct?  What's the solution?

I'm not sure at this point, but I need a build without the incorrect  
flag to be able to determine what went wrong.  We've built Open MPI  
with 64 bit builds of GM before, so I'm surprised there were any  
problems...

Thanks,

Brian
