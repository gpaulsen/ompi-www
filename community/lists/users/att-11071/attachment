Dear Open-mpi users,<br><br>I have installed openmpi on 2 different
machines with different architectures (INTEL and x86_64) separately
(command: ./configure --enable-heterogeneous). Compiled executables of
the same code for these 2 arch. Kept these executables on individual
machines. Prepared a hostfile containing the names of those 2 machines.<br>
Now, when I want to execute the code (giving command - ./mpirun
-hostfile machines executable), it doesn&#39;t work, giving error message:<br><br>MPI_ABORT was invoked on rank 2 in communicator MPI_COMM_WORLD<br>with errorcode 1.<br><br>NOTE: invoking MPI_ABORT causes Open MPI to kill all MPI processes.<br>
You may or may not see output from other processes, depending on<br>exactly when Open MPI kills them.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
mpirun has exited due to process rank 2 with PID 1712 on<br>node studpc1.xxx.xxxx.xx exiting without calling &quot;finalize&quot;. This may<br>have caused other processes in the application to be<br>terminated by signals sent by mpirun (as reported here)<br>
<br>When I keep only one machine-name in the hostfile, then the execution works perfect.<br><br>Will anybody please guide me to run the program on heterogeneous environment using mpirun!<br><br>Thanking you,<br><br>Sincerely,<br>
Yogesh<br>
