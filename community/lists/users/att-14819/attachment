When I submit my job through a batch file, the job exits with the message that the executable could not be found on the machines. I have tried a lot of options such as PBS -V and so on on but the problem persists. If someone is interested, I can send the full info on the cluster, the compiler and openmpi settings and other stuff. BTW the launcher is torque (which you might have guessed). The code does not have a forum so I am in a deep mire.</div>
