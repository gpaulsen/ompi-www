I am a project written in C/C++ but used 3rd-party libraries written in Fortran. In the linking stage, I use mpic++ andl need to put -lmpi_f90 -lmpi_f77 into the link flags. <br>I am wondering if anyone has already had a way to identify openmpi in configure script using autoconf macro. By identifying openmpi in the configure, I will be able to handle those libraries. Thanks.
