Hi All,<br><br><br>I am experimenting with the  openMPI checkpoint and restart mechanism.<br>I have installed blcr-0.8.2 in /usr directory of  Redhat linux system,RHEL 5 (2.6..18-164.el5).<br>I have unpacked  openmpi-1.4.2 to /usr and installed.<br>

<br>while configuring openMPI I used the following commands<br>#./configure --with-blcr=cr --enable-ft-thread --enable-mpi-threads --with-blcr=/usr/local --with-blcr-libdir=/usr/local/lib<br>#make<br>#make install<br><br>

after this i tried to run my application<br>using <br>#mpirun -np 4 -am ft-enable-cr a.out<br><br>then I got the following error<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br>It lools like MPI_INIT failed for some reason; your parallel process is likely to abort. There are many <br>

reasons that a parallel process can fail during MPI_INIT; some of due to configuration or<br>environment problems. This failure appears to be internal failure; here is some additionan information(which may only relevant to an openMPI developer);<br>

<br> ompi-mpi_ini:orte_init failed<br>--&gt;Returned &quot;Error&quot; (-1) instead of &quot;Success&quot;(0)<br>[localhost.localdomain:28655][[INVALID,INVALID] ORTE_ERROR_LOG:Errorin file runtime/orte_init.c at line 77<br>

<br>***The MPI-Init() function was called before MPI_INIT was invoked.<br>***This is disallowed by MPI standard.<br>***Your MPI job will now abort<br>[localhost.localdomain]Abort before MPI_INIT completed successfully; not able to guarantee that all other process are killed!<br>

<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>section 1 of the error mesage was repeated many times..<br><br>What may went wrong with this?<br>How can I resolve this?<br><br><br><br clear="all">
