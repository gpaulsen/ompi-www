(such as<br>&gt; &gt; length, package tag).<br>&gt; &gt;  <br>&gt; &gt; The third worker can get its head information message from master but<br>&gt; &gt; cannot get its correct <br>&gt; &gt; data package. <br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; It got the data that should be received by first worker, which get its<br>&gt; &gt; correct data. <br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; Jack,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Providing the relevant sections of code here would be very helpful.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; &lt;inside joke&gt;<br>&gt; I would tell you to add some printf statements to your code to see what<br>&gt; data is stored in your variables on the master before it sends them to<br>&gt; each node, but Jeff Squyres and I agreed to disagree in a civil manner<br>&gt; on that debugging technique earlier this week, and I'd hate to re-open<br>&gt; those old wounds by suggesting that technique here. ;)<br>&gt; &lt;/inside joke&gt;<br>&gt; <br>&gt; -- <br>&gt; Prentice<br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; users mailing list<br>&gt; users@open-mpi.org<br>&gt; http://www.open-mpi.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/users<br></div> 		 	   		  </body>
