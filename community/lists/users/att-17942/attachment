Hi All, <br><br>I have installed openmpi for gfortran, but am now attempting to install openmpi as ifort. <br><br>I have run the following configuration: <br>./configure --prefix=/opt/openmpi/intel CC=gcc CXX=g++ F77=ifort FC=ifort<br>
<br>The install works successfully, but when I run /opt/openmpi/intel/bin/mpif90, it runs as gfortran. <br>Oddly, when I am user: root, the same mpif90 runs as ifort. <br><br>Can someone please alleviate my confusion as to why I mpif90 is not running as ifort? <br>
<br>Thank you for your suggestions, <br clear="all"><br>-- <br>Micah<br><br><br>
