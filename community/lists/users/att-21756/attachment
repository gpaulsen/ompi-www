<div dir="ltr"><div><div><div>Hi,<br><br></div>When I copy my OpenMPI installed directory to another computer (the runtime files), and point PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH to this installed folder (to make mpirun point to the copied folder&#39;s bin), it does not seem to run (it&#39;s not supposed to run because I compiled it on a different machine with a different prefix and just copying the runtimes). <br>
<br></div>Is there a way to compile the libraries such that it could be copied to a different machine and be used? <br><br></div>Thanks<br>MM<br></div>
