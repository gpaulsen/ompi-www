<br>&nbsp; As a quick follow-up to my own post, I just tried this on a few other systems:<br><br>1) One system, on which the nodes have only one ethernet device, running the code with the split &quot;-np&quot; arguments works fine.
<br>2) Another system, which has IB links (as default), runs the code fine.<br>3) Two very similar systems, each with two ethernet devices on each node (hence the mca parameters), and on both of these systems the code does 
<i>not</i> work, giving the connection errors shown earlier.<br><br>&nbsp; I&#39;ll try a few more things tomorrow, but I have to imagine other people have seen this, or I&#39;m just missing a crucial mca parameter?<br><br>&nbsp; Thanks very much,
