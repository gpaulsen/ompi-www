<div dir="ltr"><div><div><div><div><div>Hi All,<br> <br></div>I, for the life of me, can&#39;t understand the difference between these two init_thread modes. <br><br>MPI_THREAD_SINGLE states that &quot;only one thread will execute&quot;, but MPI_THREAD_FUNNELED states &quot;The process may be multi-threaded, but only the main 
thread will make MPI calls (all MPI calls are funneled to the 
main thread).&quot;<br><br></div>If I use MPI_THREAD_SINGLE, and just create a bunch of pthreads that dumbly loop in the background, the MPI library will have no way of detecting this, nor should this have any affects on the machine. <br>

<br></div>This is exactly the same as MPI_THREAD_FUNNELED. What exactly does it mean with &quot;only one thread will execute?&quot; The openmpi library has absolutely zero way of knowng I&#39;ve spawned other pthreads, and since these pthreads aren&#39;t actually doing MPI communication, I fail to see how this would interfere. <br>

<br>I&#39;m asking because I&#39;m using an open_mpi build ontop of infiniband, and the maximum thread mode is MPI_THREAD_SINGLE.<br><br></div>What am I misunderstanding?<br><br>Thanks,<br></div>Jai<br></div>
