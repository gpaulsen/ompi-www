                        MPI_THREAD_SINGLE states that "only one thread

                        "The process may be multi-threaded, but only the
                        main thread will make MPI calls (all MPI calls
                        are funneled to the main thread)."<br>

                      If I use MPI_THREAD_SINGLE, and just create a
                      bunch of pthreads that dumbly loop in the
                      background, the MPI library will have no way of
                      detecting this, nor should this have any affects
                      on the machine.

                    This is exactly the same as MPI_THREAD_FUNNELED.
                    What exactly does it mean with "only one thread will
                    execute?" The openmpi library has absolutely zero
                    way of knowng I've spawned other pthreads, and since
                    these pthreads aren't actually doing MPI
                    communication, I fail to see how this would
                    interfere. </div>

      <div>Technically, if you call MPI_INIT_THREAD with
        MPI_THREAD_SINGLE, you have made a promise that you will not
        create any other threads in your application. &nbsp;There was a time
        where OSes shipped threaded and non-threaded malloc, for
        example, so knowing that might be important for that last bit of
        performance. &nbsp;There are also some obscure corner cases of the
        memory model of some architectures where you might get
        unexpected results if you made an MPI Receive call in an thread
        and accessed that buffer later from another thread, which may
        require memory barriers inside the implementation, so there
        could be some differences between SINGLE and FUNNELED due to
        those barriers.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>In Open MPI, we'll handle those corner cases whether you init
        for SINGLE or FUNNELED, so there's really no practical
        difference for Open MPI, but you're then slightly less portable.</div>

    As Brian said, you aren't likely to be running on a system like
    Windows 98 where non-thread-safe libraries were preferred.&nbsp; My
    colleagues at NASA insist that any properly built MPI will support
    MPI_THREAD_FUNNELED by default, even when the documentation says
    explicit setting in MPI_Init_thread() is mandatory.&nbsp; The statement
    which I see in OpenMPI doc says all MPI calls must be made by the
    thread which calls MPI_Init_thread.&nbsp; Apparently it will work if
    plain MPI_Init is used instead.&nbsp; This theory appears to hold up for
    all the MPI implementations of interest.&nbsp; The additional threads
    referred to are "inside the MPI rank," although I suppose additional
    application threads not involved with MPI are possible.<br>
