Hello,<br>
<br>
I&#39;m a newbie on MPI, just playing around with the things.<br>
I&#39;ve searched through the internet but couldn&#39;t find an appropriate code example for my problem.<br>
<br>
I&#39;m making comparisons, correlations on my cluster, and gaining the results like this:<br>
vector&lt;ComparisonResult&gt; results;<br>
<br>
In every node, they calculate and create the results array, in their local storage.<br>
And then I&#39;d like to collect these vectors in my server node, rank (0).<br>
<br>
I had done this with MPI gather but just for double arrays, not with objects or vectors.<br>
<br>
I have some guess about MPI::Create_contiguous, or MPI::Create_vector functions,<br>
but all these ask for another associated MPI type, such as CHAR or INT or etc.<br>
And I don&#39;t know if I should use packing somehow...<br>
<br>
is there a way to collect these vectors in my server node with Gather function?<br>
or even with send &amp; recv?<br>
<br>
Thanks a lot, <br clear="all"><br>-- <br>Saygin
