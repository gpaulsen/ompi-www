<div dir="ltr"><div><div><div><div>Hello OpenMPI,<br><br></div>I am wondering what level of support is there for CUDA and GPUdirect on OpenMPI 1.6.5 and 1.7.2.<br><br></div>I saw the ./configure --with-cuda=CUDA_DIR option in the FAQ. However, it seems that with configure v1.6.5 it was ignored.<br>
<br></div>Can you identify GPU memory and send messages from it directly without copying to host memory first? <br><br><br></div><div>Or in general, what level of CUDA support is there on 1.6.5 and 1.7.2 ? Do you support SDK 5.0 and above?<br>
