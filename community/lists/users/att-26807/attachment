      Can you build hwloc and run lstopo on these nodes to check that
      everything looks similar?<br>
      You have hyperthreading enabled on all nodes, and you're trying to
      bind processes to entire cores, right?<br>
      Does 0,16 correspond to two hyperthreads within a single core on
      these nodes? (lstopo -p should show PU#0 and PU#16 inside the
      first core).<br>
      thanks<br>

      <pre wrap="">Hi all - we’re having a new error, despite the fact that as far as I can tell we haven’t changed anything recently, and I was wondering if anyone had any ideas as to what might be going on. 

The symptom is that we sometimes get an error when starting a new mpi job:
Open MPI tried to bind a new process, but something went wrong.  The
process was killed without launching the target application.  Your job
will now abort.

  Local host:        compute-1-19
  Application name:  XXXXXXXXX
  Error message:     hwloc_set_cpubind returned "Error" for bitmap "0,16"
  Location:          odls_default_module.c:499
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
16 total processes failed to start

This started happening with one particular node, although there’s nothing obviously wrong with it.  Now it’s happening with another, and again nothing is obviously wrong. I haven’t quite determined whether it always happens on those nodes, but it doesn’t seem to happen much at all on other nodes.

We’re running openmpi 1.7.4, which I know isn’t the newest, but it’s been working fine for months.  The kernel is 2.6.32-504.8.1.el6.x86_64 from RHEL6, and the CPUs are 
    model name	: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2670 0 @ 2.60GHz

If anyone has any ideas, I’d appreciate it.

									thanks,
									Noam
