<div>Thanks alot for your reply,</div>

<div>I&#39;m using blocking Send and Receive. All the clients are sending data and the server is receive the messages from the clients with MPI_ANY_SOURCE as the sender. Do you think there is a race condition near this pattern? </div>

<div> </div>
<div>I searched a lot and used totalview but I couldn&#39;t detect such case. I really appreciate if you send me a link or give an example of a possible race condition in that scenario . </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Also, when I partition the message into smaller parts (send in sequence - all the other clients wait until the send finish) it works fine. is that exclude the race condition?</div>

<div>&gt;&gt;We&#39;ve seen similar things in our code. In our case it is probably due to a <br>&gt;&gt;race condition. Try running the segv&#39;ing process in a debugger, and it will <br>&gt;&gt;likely show you a bug in your code <br>

<p>&gt;&gt;Hi All, <br>
<p>&gt;&gt;I&#39;m facing a strange problem with OpenMPI. <br>
<p>&gt;&gt;I&#39;m developing an application which is required to send a message from each <br>&gt;&gt;client (1 MB each) to a server node for around 10 times per second (it&#39;s a <br>&gt;&gt;distributed render application and I&#39;m trying to reach a higher frame rate <br>
&gt;&gt;). The problem is that OpenMPI crash in that case and only works if I <br>&gt;&gt;partition this messages into a set of 20 k sub-messages with a sleep between <br>&gt;&gt;each one of them for around 1 to 10 ms!! This solution is very expensive in <br>
&gt;&gt;term of time needed to send the data. Is there any other solutions? <br>
<p>&gt;&gt;The error i got now is: <br>&gt;&gt;Signal: Segmentation fault (11) <br>&gt;&gt;Signal code: Address not mapped (1) <br>&gt;&gt;Failing at address: xxxxxxxxxxxxx <br>
<p>&gt;&gt;The OS is Linux CentOS. I&#39;m using the latest version of OpenMPI. <br>
<p>&gt;&gt;I appreciate any help regarding that. <br>
<p> &gt;&gt;Regards, <br>&gt;&gt;Amr <br></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>
