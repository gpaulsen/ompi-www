Hi,<br>
<br>
To optimize our network throughput we set jumbo frame=8000. The
transfers are going smoothly. But after few minitues we are seeing
drastic drop in network throughput, looks like a problem of deadlock in
network transfer speed (slow down by a factor of 100!). This situation
is not happening if one run with jumbo frame=1500. Can this deadlock
situation be explainable in terms of packet size?<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
