<p>=====================================================
<br>
EVGM 2007
<br>
1st IEEE/IFIP International Workshop on End-to-end Virtualization and
<br>
Grid Management
<br>
San Jos&#233;, California, USA - held as part of Manweek 2007
<br>
October 29 - November 2, 2007
<br>
=====================================================
<br>
<p>Virtualization allows layer n (upper layer) to function independently
<br>
and effectively without being intrinsically tied to layer n-1 (lower
<br>
layer). In OS virtualization, guest operating systems are isolated from
<br>
physical computational resources. In server virtualization, application
<br>
servers are isolated from physical server resources. In network
<br>
virtualization, network services or applications are isolated from
<br>
physical network resources. One of the major features of Grids is the
<br>
sharing of heterogeneous resources, which can be facilitated by various
<br>
levels of virtualization. In other words, Grids should provide holistic
<br>
or end-to-end virtualization. It is obvious that proper resource
<br>
management is key to providing effective virtualization. However,
<br>
resource management for virtualization is a challenge (as opposed to
<br>
typical resource management) in that there is no trivial way of
<br>
virtualizing resources and presenting virtualized resources to the upper
<br>
layers. It is even a bigger challenge when end-to-end (E2E)
<br>
virtualization is considered, for example, when OS and server
<br>
virtualization interplay with storage and network virtualization for
<br>
providing an effective E2E virtualized environment.
<br>
<p>This workshop will offer a unique opportunity for researchers and
<br>
practitioners to exchange ideas and experiences on problems, challenges,
<br>
solutions and potential future research, as well as development issues,
<br>
in this new field of E2E Virtualization and Grid Management. In addition
<br>
to paper presentations, the workshop provides an intimate setting for
<br>
discussion and debate through panels and group work.
<br>
<p>The authors are encouraged to submit original papers on topics related
<br>
to the concepts described above, including, but not limited to:
<br>
# OS resource management for virtualization (OS Virtualization)
<br>
# Server resource management for virtualization (Server
<br>
Virtualization)
<br>
# Application resource management for virtualization (Application
<br>
Virtualization)
<br>
# Storage resource management for virtualization (Storage
<br>
Virtualization)
<br>
# Network resource management for virtualization (Network
<br>
Virtualization)
<br>
# Network Management resource management for virtualization (NM
<br>
Virtualization)
<br>
# Heterogeneous Grid VO resource management for virtualization (Grid
<br>
Virtualization)
<br>
# Interplay of various virtualization layers
<br>
# Virtual resource scheduling
<br>
# Virtual resource discovery
<br>
# Virtual resource monitoring
<br>
# Virtualization in clusters and high-performance computing
<br>
environments
<br>
# Virtualization for ERP, CRM, Healthcare, Financial applications
