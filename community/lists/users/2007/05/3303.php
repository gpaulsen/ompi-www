<p><p>CALL FOR BOOK CHAPTERS
<br>
<p><p>BOOK TITLE:
<br>
Process Algebra for Parallel and Distributed Processing:
<br>
Algebraic Languages in Specification-Based Software Development
<br>
<p>EDITORS:
<br>
Michael Alexander, WU Wien
<br>
Bill Gardner, University of Guelph
<br>
<p>The book will be published in the Computational Science Series by
<br>
Chapman and Hall/CRC Press in 2008
<br>
<p><p>INTRODUCTION:
<br>
<p>Programming today's multi-core processor architectures, clusters, and
<br>
grids is hard. Compiler research -- despite years of effort -- has still
<br>
not produced implicit instruction parallelism detection that goes much
<br>
beyond that of basic loop-parallelism. In addition, parallel programming
<br>
in the past two decades has seen only measured improvements in parallel
<br>
algorithms, languages with parallel expressivity, frameworks, and
<br>
distributed validation support. As compilers have failed to deliver on
<br>
their original promises, the objective of easing fine-grained parallel
<br>
application programmability remains.
<br>
<p>As a consequence, new and additional paradigms are being looked at to
<br>
solve what amounts to an emerging &quot;parallel software development
<br>
crisis&quot;. The approach that looks most promising is that of
<br>
specification-based software development. It has its origins 3 decades
<br>
ago, and it has been in a holding state for many years, only to
<br>
re-emerge to a wider audience with the advent of the Object Management
<br>
Group's Model Driven Architecture (MDA). Yet, specification-based
<br>
software development can only deliver correct, parallel and distributed
<br>
programs if the specification is precise, sufficiently expressive, and
<br>
complete. Here, algebraic languages and process algebras are the
<br>
paradigm that could catalyze solutions to many problems hampering
<br>
efficient multi-core processor, cluster, and grid programmability
<br>
problems. They are moving into a wide realm, as evidenced by the recent
<br>
release of an interpreter for the algebraic Sun Fortress Language.
<br>
<p>The book is targeted to bring together the state-of-the-art in research
<br>
on the application of algebraic languages and process algebras to
<br>
parallel and distributed processing. It will be written to the problem
<br>
statement of programming today's multi-core processor architectures,
<br>
clusters, and grids.
<br>

approach in each.
