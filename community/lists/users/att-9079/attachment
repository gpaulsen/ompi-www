<div dir="ltr">Hi,<br><br>I&#39;m a grad student, working on a MPI communication optimization, and I&#39;ve been working with Open-MPI for quite a while now. I&#39;m also a TA in a course about open-source development, and I would like to present Open-MPI as a case study. In particular, I thought about something along the lines of the developer workshop, only fitted in 2 hours time. I was hoping there is some editable material (possibly, copies of presentations) available. Can you point me in the right direction?<br>
<br>Thanks,<br>Alex<br></div>
