Hi,
<div><br></div><div>I&#39;d like to know if there is a way to checkpoint a specific process running under an mpirun call. In other words, is there a function CHECKPOINT(rank) in which I can pass the rank of the process I want to checkpoint? I do not want to checkpoint the entire application, but just one of its processes.</div>
<div><br></div><div>Thanks</div>
