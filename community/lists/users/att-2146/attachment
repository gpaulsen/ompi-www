<div>Interesting question; I too would like to hear about it from the experts in this forum. However, off the top of my head, I have the following advise for you.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Yes, you could share the memory between processes using the shm_xxx system calls of unix. However, it would be a lot easier if you used a thread programming paradigm like pthread. A lot of these overhead would be handled for you by the library itself.
</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In general, there is not a lot of performance gains by oversubscribing your processors (i.e. number of processes &gt; number of CPUs), unless your processes are I/O bound and are blocked for a significant amount of time. I don't know what your application is, but in the HPC world, such problems are rare.
</div>

<div>In general, processes on a shared memory node (i.e. an SMP machine) have a significantly higher memory bandwidth and reduced latency, than those across a node, even when the interconnect network is RDMA capable (such as infiniband)

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp; I had the following setup:</div>
<div>&nbsp;Rank 0 process on node 1 wants to send an array of particular size&nbsp;to&nbsp;Rank 1 process on&nbsp;same node.</div>
<div>1.&nbsp;What are the optimisations that can be done/invoked while&nbsp;running mpirun&nbsp; to perform this memory to memory transfer efficiently?</div>
<div>2. Is there any performance gain&nbsp; if 2 processes that are exchanging&nbsp;data arrays are kept on the same node rather than on different nodes connected by infiniband?</div>
<div>&nbsp;Awaiting a reply,</div>
