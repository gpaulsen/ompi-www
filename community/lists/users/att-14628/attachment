    Hi Kalin,<br>
    <br>
    Sorry for the late reply. <br>
    <br>
    I checked the code and got confused. (I'm not and MPI expert)&nbsp; I'm
    just wondering how to start the server and client in the same mpirun
    command while the client needs a hand-input port name, which is
    given by the server at runtime. <br>
    <br>
    I found a similar program on the Internet (see attached), that works
    well on my Windows. In this program, the generated port name will be
    send among the processes by MPI_Send.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Regards,<br>
    Shiqing<br>

      I am trying to create a client/server application with OpenMPI,
      which has been installed on a Windows machine, by following the
      instruction (with CMake) in the README.WINDOWS file in the OpenMPI
      distribution (version 1.4.2). I have ran other test application
      that compile file under the Visual Studio 2008 Command Prompt.
      However I get the following errors on the server side when
      accepting a new client that is trying to connect:

      mpirun has exited due to process rank 0 with PID 476 on
      <br>
      node Lazar exiting without calling "finalize". This may
      <br>
      have caused other processes in the application to be
      <br>
      terminated by signals sent by mpirun (as reported here).
      <br>

      <br>
      The server and client code is attached. I have straggled with this
      problem for quite a while, so please let me know what the issue
      might be. I have looked at the archives and the FAQ, and the only
      thing similar that I have found had to do with different version
      of OpenMPI installed, but I only have one version, and I believe
      it is the one being used.
      <br>
      <br>
      Thank you,
      <br>
