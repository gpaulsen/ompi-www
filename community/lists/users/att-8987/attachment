&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there any way to automatically checkpoint/restart an application in OpenMPI? This is, checkpointing the application without using the command ompi-checkpoint, perhaps via a function call in the application's code itself. The same with the restart after a failure.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; On a related note, what is the default behavior of an OpenMPI application after one process fails? Does the runtime shut down the whole application?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.
