<html><body style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space; ">Hi Jeff,<div><br class="webkit-block-placeholder"></div><div>It seems that the problems are partially the compilers fault, maybe the updated compilers didn't catch all the problems filed against the last release? Why else would I need to add the "-no-multibyte-chars" flag for pretty much everything that I build with ICC? Also, its odd that I have to use /lib/cpp when using Intel ICC/ICPC whereas with GCC things just find their way correctly. Again, IFORT and GCC together seem fine. Lastly... not that I use these... but MPICH-2.1 and MPICH-1.2.7 for Myrinet built just fine.</div><div><br class="webkit-block-placeholder"></div><div>Here are the output files:</div><div><br class="webkit-block-placeholder"></div><div><br class="webkit-block-placeholder"></div><div></div></body></html>
