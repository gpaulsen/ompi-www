As mentioned in Lisandro's reply, my webservice is acting as a proxy to
the MPI application.<br>
In the webservice, the SOAP parameters are bind into C++ object model.<br>
<br>
But I have several questions:<br>
<br>
(1) It seems MPI_Comm_spawn() command just execute the MPI programm
like an external application.<br>
So, the C++ object-model created in webservice, is not accessible in my
MPI application.(illustrated in blue line)<br>
If thats the case,to pass the input parameters, I have to marshal my
object-model into an XML file , then call MPI_Comm_spawn() with the
filename as an argument,so that MPI programm can read the values from
the XML file.(illustrated in red lines)<br>
Is there any other way to do this?<br>
<br>
(2) Before calling MPI_Comm_spawn() in my webservice,I have to
initialize MPI by calling, MPI_Init(),MPI_Comm_get_parent()..etc.<br>
So do I have to initialize MPI in my webservice logic.<br>
If thats the case,I can't start my webservice in standard way like:<br>
<br>
#./svmWebservice<br>
<br>
but in MPI way:<br>
#mpirun -np 100 -hostfile ~./hosts svmWebservice&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
??? which is confusing ??<br>
<br>
Any tips?<br>
Thanks in advance,<br>

  <pre wrap="">I do not know anything about implementing webservices, but you should
take a look at MPI-2 dynamic process management. This way, your
webservice can MPI_Comm_spawn() a brand-new set of parallel processes
doing the heavy work. This way, your webservice will act as a kind of
proxy application between the request coming from the outside world
and your parallel computing resources...

    <pre wrap="">Greetings all,

I am in the design level of parallizing an SVM algorithm.We need to expose
this as a webservice.I have decided to go with Axis2/C implementation.

Please refer to : <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://i30.tinypic.com/i707qq.png">http://i30.tinypic.com/i707qq.png</a>

As can be seen in the Figure1 , can I embedd my MPI logic in side my
Webservice ? I guess that its not possible because the webservice is
packaged as a static library (myService.so) and can not execute the
"mpirun".

In Figure2, I have illustrated another alternative.In my Webservice, I
invoke my parallel program (myParallelProg) using "mpirun" and other
parameters.

Is there any good design to accomplish what I am trying to do?I think the
second is not a good design ?

Thanks in advance,
umanga
