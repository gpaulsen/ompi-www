<div dir="ltr"><div><div>Hi,<br><br></div>I am currently testing OpenMPI applications running on SLURM and I wanted to test the MapReduce integration but I have trouble finding the actual MR+ package. Namely, both on your and SLURM there are some informations about MR+, some of them relatively old,  but I could not find any actual software package being available. I have been to Greenplum&#39;s web page but their MR product is some remix of MapR, not the MR+ on OpenMPI. Could anyone tell me was MR+ released already, and if so, where it is? If not, how can I get early adopter&#39;s version?<br>
<br></div>Many thanks for the help.<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Jakub<br clear="all"><div><div><div><div><br>
