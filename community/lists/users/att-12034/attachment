Hi,<br><br>Let&#39;s say I have an MPI application running on several hosts. Is there any way to checkpoint this application without having a shared storage between the nodes?<br>I already took a look at the examples here <a href="http://www.osl.iu.edu/research/ft/ompi-cr/examples.php">http://www.osl.iu.edu/research/ft/ompi-cr/examples.php</a>, but it seems that in both cases there is a globally mounted file system. <br>
<br>Thanks,<br>Andreea<br><br>
