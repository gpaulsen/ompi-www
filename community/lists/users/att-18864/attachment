Hi Edgar,<br><br>I tested the execution of my code using the option -mca coll ^inter as you suggested and the program worked fine, even when I use 1 server instance.<br><br><span dir="ltr" id=":290"></span>What is the modification caused by this parameter? I did not find an explanation about the utilization of the module coll inter.<br>
