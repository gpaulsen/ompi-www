<span class="HcCDpe">Hello,<br><br>I am new into this mailing list, and am trying to install openMPI on Ubuntu <a href="http://8.0.4.1">8.0.4.1</a><br><br>Basically my idea is to build a beowulf. Well right now i even dont have lots of PC&#39;s for this purpose.<br>
<br>So I am planning to first use virtual machines on VmWare. I have installed around four Virtual machines on my PC. And all of them can talk to each other. I mean they are all networked together without any firewalls in between.<br>
<br>I downloaded openmpi-1.2.8.tar.gz, extracted it and executed the configure script file.<br><br>This gave me lots of errors, and didnt suceed. How do I get this working now.<br><br>Any one please help me.<br><br><br>I am fairly good in using Linux but have no idea about openMPI.<br>
I know C and C++ pretty well. And planning to learn using MPI.<br><br><br clear="all"></span>Regards<br><br>Venu Gopal<br>
