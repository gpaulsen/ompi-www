Hi there,<br><br>We have a cluster with 2 HCAs installed on each node (Mellanox ConnectX IB QDR cards). It&#39;s not clear from the documentation how we could use both of them for MPI communications.<br>What should we do to enable 2 cards and how we can check that both are using?<br>
<br>Thanks in advance!<br>   Dmitry<br><br>
