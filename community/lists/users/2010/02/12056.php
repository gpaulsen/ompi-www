<span class="quotelev1">&gt; I can't say for sure, of course, but if MPI hello world hangs, it smells like a compiler bug.  You might want to attach to &quot;hello world&quot; in a debugger and see where it's hung.  You might need to compile OMPI with debugging symbols to get any meaningful information.

<p>Pathscale is not dead, in fact I'm talking to them more or less daily at
<br>
the moment. They have been restructuring since the demise of SciCortex
<br>
last year. I hope they will be able to release a new version fairly
<br>
soon.
<br>
<p>In my opinion (working mostly with Fortran codes, shudder) it is the
<br>
best compiler around. Although they have had problems over the years in
<br>
coming out with fixes for bugs in a timely fashion.
