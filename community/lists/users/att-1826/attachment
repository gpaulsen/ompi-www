<div>My opinion would be to use pthreads, for a couple of reasons:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. You don't need an OMP aware compiler; any old compiler would do.</div>
<div>2. The pthread library is more well adapted and hence might be more optimized than the code emitted from an OMP compiler.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If your operating system is Linux, you may use the clone() system call directly; this would add further optimization at the expense of portability.</div>
