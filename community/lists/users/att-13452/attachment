from the start of your program, after a certain activitiy, say after 10 lines use print statement with STOP/EXIT , also printing processor rank.<br><br>If u get all the processors than its fine. Move this printing little ahead and get printing again. Repeat this process  until u reach the place of fault. Still u need to guess/observe what is the error in code. with print statement u will reach in the vicinity/segment of error. What is the error-----u need to observe.<br>
