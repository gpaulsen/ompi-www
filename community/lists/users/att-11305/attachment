Hi,<br>thanks T.Prince,<br><br>Your saying:<br>&quot;I&#39;ll just mention that we are well into the era of 3 levels of
programming parallelization:  vectorization, threaded parallel (e.g.
OpenMP), and process parallel (e.g. MPI).&quot;  is a really great new learning for me. Now I can perceive better.<br><br><br>Can you please explain a bit about:<br><br>&quot; This application gains significant benefit from cache blocking, so
vectorization has more opportunity to gain than for applications which
have less memory locality.&quot;<br><br>So now should I conclude from your reply that if we have single core processor in a PC, even than we can get benefit of Auto-Vectorization? And we do not need free cores for getting benefit of auto-vectorization?<br>
<br>Thank you very much.<br>
