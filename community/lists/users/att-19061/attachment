<font size=2 face="sans-serif">MPI_Iprobe returns a single status object
if at least one message is waiting in a queue. &nbsp;I would like to be
able to do something similar (i.e., non blocking probes) which would produce
an array of status objects representing all messages waiting in a queue.
&nbsp;I would then decide on the order of actual message reception based
on the source field of the status array objects. &nbsp;Does anyone know
of a way to accomplish this?</font>
