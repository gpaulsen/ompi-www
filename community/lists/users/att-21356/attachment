I having some difficulties with building/running 1.6.3 on Mountain Lion (10.8.2). I build with no errors and install into a prefix directory. I get the following errors:<div>...</div><div><div>[bolstadm-lm3:38486] mca: base: component_find: unable to open /Users/bolstadm/papillon/build/macosx-x86_64/Release/openmpi-1.6.3/lib/openmpi/mca_shmem_sysv: lt_dlerror() returned NULL!
