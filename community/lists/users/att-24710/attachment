<div dir="ltr">I&#39;m on the road today, but will be back tomorrow afternoon (US Pacific time) and can forward my notes on this again. In the interim, just go to our user mailing list archives and search for &quot;phi&quot; and you&#39;ll see the conversations. Basically, you have to cross-compile OMPI to run on the Phi.<div>

I&#39;m currently working towards setting up a single node system with a<br>
xeon phi card. We have intel compilers (v.13.1.3) installed and I was<br>
able to get the standard openmpi (v1.6.5) to install.<br>
<br>
Right now, I am just hoping to run codes natively on the xeon phi.<br>
When trying to compile a hello world code via &quot;mpicc -mmic hello.c&quot; it<br>
results in the error:<br>
<br>
x86_64-k1om-linux-ld: skipping incompatible<br>
/ssd/apps/openmpi-intel/lib/libmpi.so when searching for -lmpi<br>
x86_64-k1om-linux-ld: cannot find -lmpi<br>
<br>
<br>
I&#39;m guessing this is due to not having compiled openmpi with the<br>
&quot;-mmic&quot; option. Although, attempting to configure openmpi with -mmic<br>
will fail instantly as the configure attempts to test basic codes with<br>
&quot;-mmic&quot; on the host processor.<br>
<br>
In a couple of threads it was mentioned that people have been able to<br>
get this to work, but not much detail on how they built openmpi to<br>
achieve this. Any help is appreciated.<br>
