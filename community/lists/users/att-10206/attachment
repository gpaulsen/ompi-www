The only thing that changes is the required connectivity. It sounds to me like you may have a firewall issue here, where cloud3 is blocking connectivity from cloud6, but cloud6 is allowing connectivity from cloud3.<br><br>

Is there a firewall in operation, per chance?<br><font color="#888888"><br>Ralph<br></font></blockquote><div><br>I have turned off all firewalls.

<br>I see a bunch of red lines, where in any of the working tests cases I do not see any red lines. As you can tell from my analysis, I am an expert wireshark user (haha!) - can anyone interpret the problem from this file? Maybe I need to ask the wireshark mailing list for an analysis?<br>
