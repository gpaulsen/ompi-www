Hi all,<br><br>I&#39;m trying to interleave computation with communication. As a result, I have resorted to using MPI with POSIX threads. Primarily, I am trying to communicate a partial vector v3 while computing an inner product v1*v2 (mod q). To give you an idea of the platform and the libraries:<br>
1. Intel dual-socket quadcore m/c (total 8 cores/machine)<br>2. openmpi 1.3.3 (separate installations on ict6 and ict4 machines)<br>3. lib64gmp3 4.3.1<br>4. gcc 4.3.2<br>5. interconnect: Gigabit ethernet<br><br>I have used a single thread for most of the communication and the remaining 7 threads for computation. Perhaps, this portion of the code has gone wrong somewhere and the program terminates with the following error message.<br>
<br>$ mpicc test-vecvecmul.c -lgmp -pthread -Wall -o tvmul<br><br>$ mpirun --prefix /usr/local/openmpi-1.3.3/ -np 2 --host ict6,ict4 ./tvmul<br><br>[err] event_queue_remove: 0xc1d6b0(fd 10) not on queue 8<br>[err] event_queue_remove: 0xc1d6b0(fd 10) not on queue 8<br>
[ict6][[21545,1],0][../../../../../ompi/mca/btl/tcp/btl_tcp_frag.c:216:mca_btl_tcp_frag_recv] mca_btl_tcp_frag_recv: readv failed: Connection reset by peer (104)<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
mpirun has exited due to process rank 1 with PID 17154 on<br>node ict4 exiting without calling &quot;finalize&quot;. This may<br>have caused other processes in the application to be<br>terminated by signals sent by mpirun (as reported here).<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The code is attached along with. Please suggest where in the code have I gone wrong. Also, a more efficient way of interleaving (if exists) is something that I am interested in.<br>
<br>**** Can anyone suggest a good tutorial sort of thing where I can get to know about programming in MPI with POSIX threads/OpenMP.<br><br>Regards,<br>-- <br>Souvik<br><br>
