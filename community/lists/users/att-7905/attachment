<TITLE>Installing OpenMPI for Intel Fortran on OSX??</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<FONT FACE="Calibri, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><SPAN STYLE='font-size:11pt'>I OSX 10.5, have Intel Fortran, but I do not have Intel C, so need to compile OpenMPI using gcc, which is supposed to work.<BR>
When I run the configure script I get an error message about<BR>
configure: error: C and Fortran 77 compilers are not link compatible. &nbsp;Can not continue.<BR>
<BR>
I am guessing that the problem is that the Intel Fortran is compiling for a 64 bit architecture, and gcc is by default compiling for<BR>
32 bit. &nbsp;I tried setting an environment variable CFLAGS=-m64, but this did not help. &nbsp;I am really a novice at passing compiler<BR>
flags to things inside scripts, and also, not knowing these flags, and, also, maybe I tried to pass the wrong flag value. &nbsp;I would appreciate it<BR>
if anyone who knows what to do could provide a very specific recipe for exactly what I need to do to fix this problem.<BR>
Thanks very much. &nbsp;-bg</SPAN></FONT>
