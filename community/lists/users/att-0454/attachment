<div id="RTEContent">There are several mentions of R<a name="setting-global-mca-params">endezvous in various places. However, I cannot find out how to start using it. I am assuming that open-mpi's R</a><a name="setting-global-mca-params">endezvous is the same as Zero Config (a.k.a  Bonjour in Apple speak)? If not, are there plans to use Zero Config to find machines.resources?<br><br>Thanks<br></a></div><p>
