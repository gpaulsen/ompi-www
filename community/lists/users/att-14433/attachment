Dear All,<br><br>After searching for some week to find a program to do 100 000 000#+ Mersenne Prime with MPI, my research resulted to nothing.<br>So, now i&#39;m ready to pay, if someone can implement MPI to mprime : <a href="http://mersenneforum.org/gimps/source2511.zip">http://mersenneforum.org/gimps/source2511.zip</a> , or to<br>
Glucas : <a href="http://www.oxixares.com/glucas/">http://www.oxixares.com/glucas/</a>.<br><br>These two program, make Lucas-Lehmer test on an exponent to find if it is a Mersenne Prime. They both use FFT (Fast Fourrier Transform)<br>
to make the calculation.<br><br>The reason why i want this, is that exponent goes bigger and bigger, and no good program to use a HPC Cluster have been made to speedup<br>the research. Today it take a good 2 weeks on a New 4 core machine to goes through the calculation, and 1 month for a P4 3.0GHz HT.<br>
<br>The person who will accept to do it will greatly contribute to the Mersenne research, and make some money too.<br><br>I&#39;ve tried to find a way to implement the communication without falling in the embarrassingly parallel, but i&#39;m not advanced to do so.<br>
<br>Finally, a reward i offered too by the Electronic Frontier Foundation for finding new prime, and i&#39;m ready to share it with the one<br>that will make it, IF i ever find one...<br><br>So, if someone is interested, plesase let me know, Thank you!<br>
