Hello,<br><br>after some days of work and testing, i managed to install SGE on two machines, also installed openMPI 1.4.1 for each one.<br><br>SGE is working, i can submit jobs and it schedules the jobs to the available cores total of 6,<br>

<br>my problem is that im trying to run an openMPI job and i cant.<br><br>this is an example of what i am trying.<br><br>$qrsh -verbose -pe pempi mpirun -np 6 hostname<br>Your job 105 (&quot;mpirun&quot;) has been submitted<br>

waiting for interactive job to be scheduled ...<br><br>Your &quot;qrsh&quot; request could not be scheduled, try again later.<br><br>im not sure what this can be, <br>in the ompi_info i have gridengine support.<br><br>where do you recommend to look ??<br>

thanks in advance<br><br clear="all">Cristobal<br><br><br>
