few preexisting MPI implementations towards building a single,<br>
extensible MPI implementation with the best features of the prior MPI<br>
implementations. From the beginning of the project the Open MPI<br>
developer community has desired to provide a solid MPI 2 (soon MPI 3)<br>
compliant MPI implementation. Features outside of the MPI standard,<br>
such as fault tolerance, have been (and are) goals as well.<br>
<br>
The fault tolerance efforts in Open MPI have been mostly pursued by<br>
the research side of the community. As such, maintenance support for<br>
these features is often challenging and a point of frequent discussion<br>
in the core developer community. There are users for each of these<br>
fault tolerance features/techniques, so they are important to provide.<br>
Integrating these features into Open MPI without diminishing<br>
performance, scalability, and usability is often a delicate software<br>
engineering challenge. Per the prior comments on this thread, it can<br>
often lead to heated debate. :)<br>
<br>
<br>
In the Open MPI trunk and 1.6 release series there are a few fault<br>
tolerance features that you might be interested in, all with various<br>
degrees of functionality and support. Each of these features are<br>
advancements on the fault tolerance features from the LAM/MPI,<br>
MPICH-V, FT-MPI, and LA-MPI projects.<br>
<br>
Checkpoint/Restart support allows a user to manually (via a command<br>
line tool) checkpoint and restart an MPI application, migrate<br>
processes in the machine, and/or ask Open MPI to automatically restart<br>
failed processes on spare resources. Additionally, the application can<br>
use APIs to checkpoint/restart/migrate processes without using the<br>
command line tools. This C/R technique is similar to the feature<br>
provided by LAM/MPI, and was developed by Indiana University (for my<br>
PhD work). For more details see the link below:<br>
  <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=ft#cr-support" target="_blank">http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=ft#cr-support</a><br>
<br>
Message logging support was added a while back by UTK, but I am<br>
uncertain about its current state. This technique is similar to the<br>
features provided by the MPICH-V project. For more details, I think<br>
the wiki page below describes the functionality:<br>
  <a href="https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/wiki/EventLog_CR" target="_blank">https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/wiki/EventLog_CR</a><br>
<br>
The MPI Forum standardization body's Fault Tolerance Working Group has<br>
a proposal for application managed fault tolerance. In essence this is<br>
similar to the FT-MPI work, although the interface is quite a bit<br>
different. This feature is not yet in the Open MPI trunk, but you can<br>
find a beta release and more information at the link below:<br>
  <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/~jjhursey/projects/ft-open-mpi/" target="_blank">http://www.open-mpi.org/~jjhursey/projects/ft-open-mpi/</a><br>
<br>
End-to-end data reliability worked at one point in time, but I do not<br>
know if it is being maintained. This is similar to the fault tolerance<br>
features found in LA-MPI. For information about that project see the<br>
link below:<br>
  <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=ft#dr-support" target="_blank">http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=ft#dr-support</a><br>
<br>
There are also research projects that are exploring other fault<br>
tolerance techniques above MPI, such as peer based checkpointing and<br>
replication. So far, these projects have tried to stay above the MPI<br>
layer for portability, and have not requested any specific extensions<br>
of Open MPI (maybe with the exception of the work in the MPI Forum,<br>
cited above). Below are links to two such projects, though there are<br>
many others out there:<br>
  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/scalablecr/" target="_blank">http://sourceforge.net/projects/scalablecr/</a><br>

<br>
<br>
So that should give you an overview of the current state of fault<br>
tolerance techniques in Open MPI. To your question about what you can<br>
expect if a process crashes in your Open MPI job. By default, Open MPI<br>
will kill your entire MPI job and the user will have to restart the<br>
job from either the beginning of execution or from any checkpoint<br>
files that the application has written. Open MPI defaults to killing<br>
the entire MPI job since that is what is often expected by MPI<br>
applications, as most use the default MPI error handler<br>
MPI_ERRORS_ARE_FATAL:<br>
  <a href="http://www.netlib.org/utk/papers/mpi-book/node177.html" target="_blank">http://www.netlib.org/utk/papers/mpi-book/node177.html</a><br>
<br>
Last I checked, the current Open MPI trunk will terminate the entire<br>
job even if the user set MPI_ERRORS_RETURN on their communicators. A<br>
reason for this is that the behavior of MPI after returning such an<br>
error is undefined. The MPI Forum Fault Tolerance working group is<br>
working to define this behavior. So if this is of interest see the MPI<br>
Forum work cited above.<br>
<br>
If you want a fault tolerance feature, such as automatic<br>
checkpoint/restart recovery, you will need to create a build of Open<br>
MPI with that feature enabled. There are instructions on the various<br>
links above about how to do so.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you are particularly interested in one feature or have a strong use<br>
case for a set of features, then that is important information for the<br>
Open MPI developer community. This will help use as a project<br>
prioritize the maintenance of various features in the Open MPI<br>
project.<br>
<br>
<br>
Best of luck,<br>

&gt; As far as I know, OMPI combines the fault tolerant features in FT-MPI,<br>
&gt; LA-MPI and LAM/MPI, is this statement still correct now? Or as you say, OMPI<br>
&gt; supports checkpoint/restart(like in LAM/MPI) only? I don't know the details<br>
&gt; of FT-MPI or LA-MPI, aren't they useful or necesarry?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; In fact, what I really want to know is, suppose I run a job on N processors<br>
&gt; with OMPI, and one (or some) of these processors crashes, then what would be<br>
&gt; done by the fault-tolerant mechanism of OMPI? Meanwhile what should the<br>
&gt; sys-admin do(like restart the crashed node) ?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; In my understanding, after the crash, the sys-admin should restart the<br>
&gt; crashed node(if it can be restarted), and then do the rollback by some sort<br>
&gt; of command, while the OMPI would help hang up all the computing process,<br>
&gt; waiting for rollback command, is this correct?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; thanks again.<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; That's a little bit strong - OMPI still supports checkpoint/restart as a<br>
&gt; fault tolerance mechanism. There really isn't anything the sys admin has to<br>
&gt; do, though - what is required is that users periodically order their<br>
&gt; programs to checkpoint so they can be restarted after a failure.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Checkpointing is typically done either by the app itself (say, when it<br>
&gt; reaches some point it feels is a good one to save), or using a script that<br>
&gt; just orders a checkpoint every so many seconds.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; What we have said is that we don't believe the FT "run thru failure"<br>
&gt; position pushed by UTK is particularly required at this time. Partly a<br>
&gt; question of impact vs benefit, mostly due to competing approaches offering<br>
&gt; equivalent fault recovery capability with less impact. But that's a separate<br>
&gt; discussion.<br>

&gt; It has been clearly stated that the official position pushed forward by a<br>
&gt; majority of the Open MPI developer community is that fault tolerance is not<br>
&gt; needed so we (read this as the official version of Open MPI) do not support<br>
&gt; it.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; However, a group of researchers have been working toward a version of Open<br>
&gt; MPI that supports the last fault tolerance proposal submitted for<br>
&gt; consideration to the MPI Forum. You can access it<br>

&gt; Hi all,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Can anyone explain me the fault tolerant features in OpenMPI? I've read the<br>
&gt; FAQs and some papers about this topic listed in open-mpi.org, but still<br>
&gt; can't figure out when one node of my supercomputer system fails down during<br>
&gt; computing, what would happen with the fault tolerant mechanism in OpenMPI,<br>
&gt; and what should we system administrator do after the failure (or before).<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Can anyone help me? My boss want me to deploy OpenMPI in our system cuz he<br>
&gt; want the fault tolerant feature.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Thanks very much.<br>
