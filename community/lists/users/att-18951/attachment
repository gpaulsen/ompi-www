    Hello<br>
    <br>
    I got a problem with my code, wich run some kinf of a simulator.<br>
    <br>
    I get 4 worker (aka 4 mpi process ) wich process data.<br>
    <br>
    These data aren't available at the same time, so i get another
    process (Splitter) wich send chunk of data to each process in round
    robin.<br>
    <br>
    This work well using MPI_Send and Receive but aftet that i need to
    reduce all the data.<br>
    <br>
    I hope to be able to use MPI_Reduce to reduce all data from all
    worker but there is a problem :<br>
    <br>
    1. All results data aren't available at the same time, dut to the
    delay from the original data delay.<br>
    2. I cannot wait all data to be computed, i need to proceed the
    reduce a soon as possible<br>
    <br>
    So when the first and second worker have finished, i can reduce the
    two results data and keep the results on the first worker.<br>
    And when the third and the fourth have finished, i can reduce these
    two too, and keep results on third worker.<br>
    At last i need to reduce data from first and third worker.<br>
    <br>
    The only way to do that using MPI_Reduce is to create
    "communicators".<br>
    <br>
    All i want is :<br>
    <br>
    commA : contain W1 W2<br>
    commB : contain W3 W4<br>
    commC : contain W1 W3<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Let's say i've already create a communicator only for my workers <br>
    I can easily add this line in all my workers :<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    MPI_Comm_Split(workers_comm,(int)(workerId/2),rank,CommAlpha)<br>
    <br>
    <b>If i understand well i will get an communicator on W1 and W2 wich
      contains W1 and W2, and a communicator on W3 and W4 wich contains
      W3 and W4. Am i right?</b><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    But next when i try to use (only on W1 and W3): <br>
    <br>
    MPI_Create_comm(MPI_Comm workers_comm,group,commC),<br>
    <br>
    <b>I need also to call MPI_Create_comm on W2 and W4 or it will
      block. Why?</b><br>
    <br>
    After that, i got lot of non persistent error depending of the
    number of worker i want to use.<br>
    <b>So is this allowed to create and use overlapping communicator?
      and if so how to do that?</b><br>
    <br>
    Thanks<br>
    <br>
