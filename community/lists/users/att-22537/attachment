<p>Agree with what you say Dave.</p>
<p>Regarding not wanting jobs to use certsin cores ie. reserving low-numbered cores for OS processes then surely a good way forward is to use a &#39;boot cpuset&#39; of one or two cores and let your jobs run on the rest of the cores.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right about cpusets being helpful with &#39;badly behaved&#39; jobs.<br>
