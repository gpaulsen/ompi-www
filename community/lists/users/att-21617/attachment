    Hi folks,<br>
    <br>
    I am sorry if this question had been asked before, but after ten
    days of searching/working on the system, I surrender :(. We try to
    use mpirun to run abinit (abinit.org) which in turns will call an
    input file to run some simulation. The command to run is pretty
    simple<br>
    <br>
    $ mpirun -np 4 /opt/apps/abinit/bin/abinit &lt; input.files
    &gt;&amp; output.log<br>
    <br>
    We ran this command on a server with two quad core x5420 and 16GB of
    memory. I called only 4 core, and I guess in theory each of the core
    should take up to 2GB each.<br>
    <br>
    In the output of the log, there is something about memory:<br>
    <br>
    P This job should need less than&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 717.175 Mbytes
    of memory.<br>
    &nbsp; Rough estimation (10% accuracy) of disk space for files :<br>
    &nbsp; WF disk file :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 69.524 Mbytes ; DEN or POT disk file :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    14.240 Mbytes.<br>
    <br>
    So basically it reported that the above job should not take more
    than 718MB each core.<br>
    <br>
    But I still have the Segmentation Fault error:<br>
    <br>
    mpirun noticed that process rank 0 with PID 16099 on node biobos
    exited on signal 11 (Segmentation fault).<br>
    <br>
    The system already has limits up to unlimited:<br>
    <br>
    $ cat /etc/security/limits.conf | grep -v '#'<br>
    * soft memlock unlimited<br>
    * hard memlock unlimited<br>
    <br>
    I also tried to run<br>
    <br>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    $ ulimit -l unlimited<br>
    <br>
    before the mpirun command above, but it did not help at all.<br>
    <br>
    If we adjust the parameters of the input.files to give the reported
    mem per core is less than 512MB, then the job runs fine.<br>
    <br>
    Please help,<br>
    <br>
    Thanks,<br>
    <br>
