Even if you implement your own protocol to broadcast the root of the next operation, without an agreement protocol this might lead to unmatched collectives. The most straightforward way to reach an agreement with MPI today is by focusing all broadcast decisions through a single process (a leader), who will decide in which order to available broadcast operations will be executed.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; George.</div><div><br></div><div><div><div>On Apr 30, 2013, at 09:40 , Randolph Pullen &lt;<a href="mailto:randolph_pullen@yahoo.com.au">randolph_pullen@yahoo.com.au</a>&gt; wrote:</div><br class="Apple-interchange-newline"><blockquote type="cite"><div><div style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: 'times new roman', 'new york', times, serif; font-size: 12pt; ">Oops,I think I meant gather not scatter...</div></div>_______________________________________________<br>users mailing list<br><a href="mailto:users@open-mpi.org">users@open-mpi.org</a><br>http://www.open-mpi.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/users</blockquote></div><br></div></body></html>
