Dear OpenMPI community,
<br>
<p>This email is about whether a commercial version of OpenMPI for Windows
<br>
could be successful.  I hesitated before sending this, but upon asking
<br>
some others (notably Jeff) on this list, it seemed appropriate.
<br>
<p>We at Tech-X have been asking whether a commercial/freemium support 
<br>
model for a Windows
<br>
version of OpenMPI would work.  We are currently working on this for some
<br>
other products, notably PETSc, which is discussed at
<br>
<a href="http://www.txcorp.com/home/cosml">http://www.txcorp.com/home/cosml</a>.
<br>
<p>We see some downsides - in particular, with Microsoft's HPC Pack, 
<br>
Windows users
<br>
have free access to an MPI solution.  This has to be balanced by some
<br>
particular advantages of OpenMPI such that there would be a group of
<br>
users who would pay for it for anyone to make this work.
<br>
<p>We would be very interested in hearing from folks on this list who either
<br>
(1) help define the competitive advantage of having OpenMPI on Windows or
<br>
(2) would be interested in a commercial solution, were it available.
<br>
<p>Naturally, any solution should benefit the OpenMPI community as well to
<br>
be a success.
<br>
<p>I would be glad to hear from folks on list or off.
<br>
<p>Thx....John Cary
