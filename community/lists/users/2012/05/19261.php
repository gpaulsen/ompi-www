Hi All,
<br>
<p>I encountered a question about openmpi running. I have compiled
<br>
successfully a paralle VASP program with openmpi 1.4.2. But when I run
<br>
the compiled program with mpirun, I got the following information at
<br>
very beginning:
<br>
<p>*** The MPI_Comm_f2c() function was called before MPI_INIT was invoked.
<br>
*** This is disallowed by the MPI standard.
<br>
*** Your MPI job will now abort.
<br>
<p>I believe this error will not related to the VASP program, but only to
<br>
openmpi. But I don't how to handle. Does anybody give some solution?
<br>
<p>Thanks in advance!
<br>
<p>Dongshan
<br>
