<br>
<p>EuroMPI 2012 CALL FOR PAPERS
<br>
<p>Recent Advances in Message Passing Interface. 
<br>
19th European MPI Users' Group Meeting
<br>
<p>Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria, September 23-26, 2012
<br>
<p>www.eurompi2012.org
<br>
<p>BACKGROUND AND TOPICS
<br>
<p>EuroMPI is the preeminent meeting for users, developers and
<br>
researchers to interact and discuss new developments and applications
<br>
of message-passing parallel computing, in particular in and related to
<br>
the Message Passing Interface (MPI). The annual meeting has a long,
<br>
rich tradition, and the 19th European MPI Users' Group Meeting will
<br>
again be a lively forum for discussion of everything related to usage
<br>
and implementation of MPI and other parallel programming interfaces.
<br>
Traditionally, the meeting has focused on the efficient implementation
<br>
of aspects of MPI, typically on high-performance computing platforms,
<br>
benchmarking and tools for MPI, short-comings and extensions of MPI,
<br>
parallel I/O and fault tolerance, as well as parallel applications
<br>
using MPI. The meeting is open towards other topics, in particular
<br>
application experience and alternative interfaces for high-performance
<br>
heterogeneous, hybrid, distributed memory systems.
<br>
<p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
<br>
<p>* MPI implementation issues and improvements
<br>
* Extensions to and shortcomings of MPI
<br>
* Tools and environments for MPI
<br>
* Hybrid and heterogeneous programming with MPI and other interfaces
<br>
* Relation of MPI to alternative interfaces for hybrid/heterogeneous distributed memory systems
<br>
* Interaction between message-passing software and hardware, in particular new high performance architectures
<br>
* Fault tolerance in message-passing implementations and systems
<br>
* Performance evaluation for MPI and MPI based applications
<br>
* Automatic performance tuning of MPI applications and implementations
<br>
* Applications using message-passing, in particular in Computational Science and Scientific Computing 
<br>
* Non-standard message-passing applications
<br>
* Parallel algorithms in the message-passing paradigm
<br>
* Algorithms using the message-passing paradigm
<br>
<p>The meeting will feature contributed talks on the selected,
<br>
peer-reviewed papers, invited expert talks covering upcoming and
<br>
future issues, a vendor session where selected vendors will present
<br>
their new developments in hybrid and heterogeneous cluster and
<br>
high-performance architectures, a poster session, and a tutorial
<br>
day. As in 2011, EuroMPI 2012 will include the special session IMUDI
<br>
dedicated to improving MPI user and developer interaction. The special
<br>
session will have the same deadlines as the conference, but its own
<br>
CFP and feature its own specialist program committee that will review
<br>
all dedicated IMUDI submissions. This session should attract strongly
<br>
application focused papers showing potential or problems with MPI and
<br>
current MPI practice. IMUDI papers may be shorter and may center on
<br>
problem analysis rather than solution, and will thus contribute to
<br>
intensify discussion between MPI developers and application programmers.
<br>
Other, special sessions may be organized, and proposals are
<br>
solicited. Proceedings for EuroMPI 2012 will be published in Springer
<br>
Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS).  A Special Issue of the
<br>
Springer &quot;Computing&quot; journal is planned for a selection of the best
<br>
papers of the conference.
<br>
<p>SUBMISSION INFORMATION
<br>
<p>Contributors are invited to submit a full paper as a PDF document not
<br>
exceeding 10 pages in English. The title page should contain an
<br>
abstract of at most 100 words and five specific, topical keywords. The
<br>
paper must be formatted according to the Springer LNCS guidelines. The
<br>
usage of LaTeX for preparation of the contribution as well as the
<br>
submission in camera ready format is strongly recommended. Style files
<br>
can be found with Springer
<br>
<p>New work that is not yet mature for a full paper, short observations,
<br>
and similar brief announcements are invited for the poster
<br>
session. Contributions to the poster session should be submitted in
<br>
the form of a two page abstract. 
<br>
<p>All contributions will be fully peer reviewed by the program
<br>
committee. Papers shall be submitted electronically via Easychair, see
<br>
<a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eurompi2012">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eurompi2012</a>
<br>
<p>Papers with a very strong application focus concerned with use of MPI
<br>
and possible obstacles should be considered for submission to the
<br>
IMUDI special session, see <a href="http://press.mcs.anl.gov/imudi">http://press.mcs.anl.gov/imudi</a>
<br>
<p>SCHEDULE, IMPORTANT DATES
<br>
<p>* Submission of full papers and poster abstracts: May 5th, 2012
<br>
* Author Notification: June 11th, 2012
<br>
* Camera Ready papers due: July 6th, 2012
<br>
* Tutorial(s): September 23rd, 2012
<br>
* Conference: September 24-26th, 2012

<p>TBA
<br>
<p>CONFERENCE VENUE
<br>
<p>EuroMPI 2012 will be held in Vienna, Austria, at the Austrian Academy
<br>
of Sciences. Vienna is easily accessible by plane and train, and in
<br>
addition to the conference has a highly attractive cultural heritage.
<br>
<p>CONFERENCE FEES
<br>
<p>The conference will hopefully be well supported by sponsors, which will help
<br>
directly towards keeping the fees low. As far as possible, special student 
<br>
fees will be offered.
