Dear users,<br>I am getting following error while doing a calculation. The job is getting terminated before writing anything in output file .<br>==========================================================================================<br>
ssh: ibc18: Name or service not known^M<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>A daemon (pid 8103) died unexpectedly with status 255 while attempting<br>to launch so we are aborting.<br>
<br>There may be more information reported by the environment (see above).<br><br>This may be because the daemon was unable to find all the needed shared<br>libraries on the remote node. You may set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to have the<br>
location of the shared libraries on the remote nodes and this will<br>automatically be forwarded to the remote nodes.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
mpirun noticed that the job aborted, but has no info as to the process<br>that caused that situation.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>mpirun: clean termination accomplished<br>
================================================================================<br>Can any one help me ?? <br><br>Thanks in advances<br>-- <br>Sudhir Kumar Sahoo<br>Ph.D Scholar<div>Dept. Of Chemistry</div><div>IIT Kanpur-208016</div>
