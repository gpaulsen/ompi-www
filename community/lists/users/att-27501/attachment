<div dir="ltr"><div><div>Hi,<br><br></div>I want to know if it is allowed in MPI one-sided communication to open multiple windows simultaneously using  the same communicator. <br><br>The standard does not seem to forbid it as far as I can see, but when I look at the open mpi  osc components (rdma and portals4) it looks like a window is always identified by the context-id in the communicator (for example the match bits in portals4 component use the communicator cid to distinguish among windows, there is a hash-table in the rdma component that uses the communicator cid as the key to store open modules). It seems to me that these components may not be able to support multiple open windows opened with the same communicator. <br><br></div>Thanks,<br><div><div><div>-- <br><div class="gmail_signature">Abhisek<br><br></div>
