Dear users<div><br></div><div>I installed openmpi 1.3.3 on my PC (single core &amp; quad-processes). The compilation reported no error and I have found the executable file in the configure directory. But when I try to test it, I met a problem.Â </div>
<div><br></div><div>I tested it with Vasp and PWscf programs, respectively. I typed &quot;mpirun -np 4 vasp &amp;&quot;, and then it runs like four separated processes (not parallel run), which looks like &quot;mpirun -np 1 vasp &amp;&quot; X 4. Moreover, I tested it with pwscf by &quot;mpirun -np 4 pwscf &lt;input &gt;output &amp;&quot;, only 25% of cpu was taken up.(It should have been 100%, 4 processes).</div>
<div><br></div><div>Could anybody help me to fix this problem? Thank you in advance.<br clear="all"><br>-- <br>Sincerely yours<br><br>Jiaye Li<br><br>
