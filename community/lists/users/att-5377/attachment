Hello,<br><br>I am a new user of MPI and I would like to have your opinion on the following issue.<br>With 1 processor I keep the data in&nbsp; <br><br>std::vector&lt;std::vector&lt;double&gt; &gt; X<br><br>Then I call a function that takes various arguments, among which X[ i ] and X[ j ], i.e. two sub-vectors of X.<br>
<br>With MPI I would have the same function execute on different processors for different values of i and j in X[ i ] and X[ j ].<br><br>From my understanding since std::vector is not an MPI type it cannot be passed neither as a message nor an element of an MPI structure. I thought of using<br>
<br>double X[200][4000]<br><br>which MPI would pass but I don&#39;t see how to isolate a single row, i.e. X[99] would not make sense in this context.<br><br>Any suggestion for an efficient and possibly simple solution? <br>
<br>Thank you for your help,<br><br>Alessandro<br><br>
