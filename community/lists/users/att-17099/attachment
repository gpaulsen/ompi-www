Hi there,<div><br></div><div>I am facing some problems in an Open MPI application. Part of the application is composed by a sender and a receiver. The problem is that the sender is so much faster than the receiver, what causes the receiver&#39;s memory to be completely used, aborting the application.</div>
<div><br></div><div>I would like to know if there is a flow control scheme implemented in open mpi or if this issue have to be treated at the user application&#39;s layer. If exists, how it works and how can I use it in my application?</div>
<div><br></div><div>I did some research about this subject, but I did not find a conclusive explanation.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks a lot.</div>
