<div>Hi,&nbsp;</div><div>thank you very much for your help.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>What is the meaning of " must find a system so that every task can be&nbsp;</div><div>serialized in the same form." What is the meaning of "serize " ?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I have no experience of programming with python and XML.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I have studied your blog.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Where can I find a simple example to use the techniques you have said ?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>For exmple, I have 5 task (print "hello world !").&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I want to use 6 processors to do it in parallel.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>One processr is the manager node who distributes tasks and other 5 processors</div><div>do the printing jobs and when they are done, they tell this to the manager noitde.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Boost.Asio is a cross-platform C++ library for network and low-level I/O programming. I have no experiences of using it. Will it take a long time to learn&nbsp;</div><div>how to use it ?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If the messages are transferred by SOAP+TCP, how the manager node calls it and push task into it ?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Do I need to install SOAP+TCP on my cluster so that I can use it ?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Any help is appreciated.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Jack&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>June 20 &nbsp;2010</div><br>&gt; Date: Sun, 20 Jun 2010 21:00:06 +0200<br>&gt; From: matthieu.brucher@gmail.com<br>&gt; To: users@open-mpi.org<br>&gt; Subject: Re: [OMPI users] Open MPI task scheduler<br>&gt; <br>&gt; 2010/6/20 Jack Bryan &lt;dtustudy68@hotmail.com&gt;:<br>&gt; &gt; Hi, Matthieu:<br>&gt; &gt; Thanks for your help.<br>&gt; &gt; Most of your ideas show that what I want to do.<br>&gt; &gt; My scheduler should be able to be called from any C++ program, which can<br>&gt; &gt; put<br>&gt; &gt; a list of tasks to the scheduler and then the scheduler distributes the<br>&gt; &gt; tasks to other client nodes.<br>&gt; &gt; It may work like in this way:<br>&gt; &gt; while(still tasks available) {<br>&gt; &gt; myScheduler.push(tasks);<br>&gt; &gt; myScheduler.get(tasks results from client nodes);<br>&gt; &gt; }<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Exactly. In your case, you want only one server, so you must find a<br>&gt; system so that every task can be serialized in the same form. The<br>&gt; easiest way to do so is to serialize your parameter set as an XML<br>&gt; fragment and add the type of task as another field.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; &gt; My cluster has 400 nodes with Open MPI. The tasks should be transferred b y<br>&gt; &gt; MPI protocol.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; No, they should not ;) MPI can be used, but it is not the easiest way<br>&gt; to do so. You still have to serialize your ticket, and you have to use<br>&gt; some functions that are from MPI2 (so perhaps not as portable as MPI1<br>&gt; functions). Besides, it cannot be used from programs that do not know<br>&gt; of using MPI protocols.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; &gt; I am not familiar with &nbsp;RPC Protocol.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; RPC is not a protocol per se. SOAP is. RPC stands for Remote Procedure<br>&gt; Call. It is basically your scheduler that has several functions<br>&gt; clients can call:<br>&gt; - add tickets<br>&gt; - retrieve ticket<br>&gt; - ticket is done<br>&gt; <br>&gt; &gt; If I use Boost.ASIO and some Python/GCCXML script to generate the code, it<br>&gt; &gt; can be<br>&gt; &gt; called from C++ program on Open MPI cluster ?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Yes, SOAP is just an XML way of representing the fact that you call a<br>&gt; function on the server. You can use it with C++, Java, ... I use it<br>&gt; with Python to monitor how many tasks are remaining, for instance.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; &gt; I cannot find the skeletton on your blog.<br>&gt; &gt; Would you please tell me where to find it ?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; It's not complete as some of the work is property of my employer. This<br>&gt; is how I use GCCXML to generate the calling code:<br>&gt; http://matt.eifelle.com/2009/07/21/using-gccxml-to-automate-c-wrappers-creation/<br>&gt; You have some additional code to write, but this is the main idea.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; &gt; I really appreciate your help.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; No sweat, I hope I can give you correct hints!<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Matthieu<br>&gt; -- <br>&gt; Information System Engineer, Ph.D.<br>&gt; Blog: http://matt.eifelle.com<br>&gt; LinkedIn: http://www.linkedin.com/in/matthieubrucher<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; users mailing list<br>&gt; users@open-mpi.org<br>&gt; http://www.open-mpi.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/users<br> 		 	   		  <br /><hr />Hotmail is redefining busy with tools for the New Busy.
