So I got around this problem by building a 64bit version of libsysfs from the src rpm. However now during the &quot;make all install&quot; phase the compilation is dying on a bunch of incompatibilities. As it states those files are 32bit and I need the 64bit ppc version. Not sure why they are being built as 32 bit since I have CFLAGS and LDFLAGS set. Is there something I am missing ? (those files are built by the make)

<div>Hello, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been trying to get openmpi to install (./configure --prefix=/opt/ompi --with-openib=/usr/local/ofed)&nbsp; using various methods on rhel4 u3 ppc64. No matter what method I use when I try to build 64bit (32bit works) it fails while searching for sysfs. I know that redhat only distributes sysfsutils (which supplies 
libsysfs.so.1.0.2) in 32bit format. I was wondering if there was a workaround for this problem. I have been unable to find a ppc64 version of libsysfs. The error is contained in the attached log. Here is a summary:<br><br>

--- MCA component btl:openib (m4 configuration macro)<br>checking for MCA component btl:openib compile mode... dso<br>checking for sysfs_open_class in -lsysfs... no<br>configure: error: OpenIB support requested but required sysfs not found.  Aborting
<br><br><br>Regards.<br></div><div><span class="sg">
