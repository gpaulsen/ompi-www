Hi renato,<br>  thanks man!<br>  That was the detailed explanation.<br>  I got teh perl module too...<br>  <br>  Imran<br><br><b><i>Renato Golin &lt;rengolin@gmail.com&gt;</i></b> wrote:<blockquote class="replbq" style="border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255); margin-left: 5px; padding-left: 5px;">  On 9/13/06, imran shaik <sk.imran @yahoo.com=""> wrote:<br>&gt;  I need to run parallel jobs on a cluster typically of size 600 nodes and<br>&gt; running SGE, but the programmers are good at perl but not C or C++.

 that controls<br>the dependencies and spawn the processes (using make's -j flag) and it<br>works quite well.
