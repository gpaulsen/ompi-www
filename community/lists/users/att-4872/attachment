<br><br>SUBMISSION DEADLINE:<br>Abstracts: February 4, 2008<br>Full Paper: April 14, 2008<br><br><br>Scope:<br>Virtual machine monitors (VMMs) are becoming tightly integrated with<br>standard OS distributions, leading to increased adoption in many
<br>application areas including scientific educational and high-performance<br>computing (HPC). VMMs allow for the concurrent execution of potentially<br>large numbers of virtual machines, providing encapsulation, isolation,
<br>and the possibility for migrating VMs between physical hosts. These<br>features enable physical clusters to be treated as &quot;computation pools&quot;,<br>where a variety of execution environments can be dynamically<br>
instantiated on the underlying hardware. VM technology is therefore<br>opening up new architectures and services for HPC in cluster and grid<br>environments, but consensus has not yet emerged on the best models<br>and tools. This workshop aims to bring together researchers and
<br>practitioners working on virtualization in HPC environments, with the<br>goal of sharing experience and promoting the development of a<br>research community in this emerging area.<br><br>The workshop will be one day in length, composed of 20 min paper
<br>presentations, each followed by 10 min discussion sections.<br>Presentations may be accompanied by interactive demonstrations.<br>The workshop will also include a 30 min panel discussion by presenters.<br><br><br><br>
<br>TOPICS<br><br>Topics include, but are not limited to, the following subject matters:<br><br>- Virtualization in cluster and grid environments<br>- Workload characterizations for VM-based clusters<br>- VM cluster and grid architectures
<br>- Cluster reliability, fault-tolerance, and security<br>- Compute job entry and scheduling<br>- Compute workload load leveling<br>- Cluster and grid filesystems for VMs<br>- VMMs, VMs and QoS guarantees<br>- Research and education use cases
<br>- VM cluster distribution algorithms<br>- MPI, PVM on virtual machines<br>- System sizing<br>- Hardware support for virtualization<br>- High-speed interconnects in hypervisors<br>- Hypervisor extensions and utilities for cluster and grid computing
<br>- Network architectures for VM-based clusters<br>- VMMs/Hypervisors on large SMP machines<br>- Performance models<br>- Performance management and tuning hosts and guest VMs<br>- Power considerations<br>- VMM performance tuning on various load types
<br>- Xen/other VMM cluster/grid tools<br>- High-speed Device access from VMs<br>- Management, deployment of clusters and grid environments with VMs<br>- Information systems for virtualized clusters<br>- Management of system images for virtual machines
<br>- Integration with relevant standards e.g. CIM, GLUE, OGF, etc.<br><br><br>PAPER SUBMISSION<br><br>Papers submitted to each workshop will be reviewed by at least two<br>members of the program committee and external reviewers. Submissions
<br>should include abstract, key words, the e-mail address of the<br>corresponding author, and must not exceed 10 pages, including tables<br>and figures at a main font size no smaller than 11 point. Submission<br>of a paper should be regarded as a commitment that, should the paper be
<br>accepted, at least one of the authors will register and attend the<br>conference to present the work.<br><br>Accepted papers will be published in the Springer LNCS series - the<br>format must be according to the Springer LNCS Style. Initial
<br>submissions are in PDF, accepted papers will be requested to<br>provided source files.<br><br><a href="http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html" target="_blank">http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html</a><br>
