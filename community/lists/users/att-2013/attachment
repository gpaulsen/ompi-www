<P><FONT SIZE=2>Hi,<BR>
<BR>
When I tried to install OpenMPI on the front node of a cluster using OpenPBS batch system (e.g. --with-tm=/usr/open-pbs argument to configure), it didn't work and I got the error message:<BR>
<BR>
--- MCA component pls:tm (m4 configuration macro)<BR>
checking for MCA component pls:tm compile mode... dso<BR>

checking for tm_finalize in -ltorque... no<BR>
configure: error: TM support requested but not found.&nbsp; Aborting<BR>
<BR>
By looking in the very long configure script I found two typo errors in variable name:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &quot;ompi_check_tm_hapy&quot; is set at lines 68164 and 76084<BR>
&nbsp; &quot;ompi_check_loadleveler_hapy&quot; is set at line 73086<BR>
<BR>
where the correct names are obviously &quot;ompi_check_tm_happy&quot; and &quot;ompi_check_loadleveler_happy&quot; (e.g. &quot;happy&quot; not &quot;hapy&quot;) when looking to the variables used arround.<BR>
<BR>
I corrected the variables names but unfortunately it didn't fixed my problem, configure stoped with the same error message (maybe you should also correct it in your &quot;svn&quot; repository since this may be a &quot;latent&quot; bug).<BR>
<BR>
I'm now questionning why didn't the configuration script found the 'tm_init'&nbsp; symbol in libpbs.a since the following command:<BR>
<BR>
nm /usr/open-pbs/lib/libpbs.a&nbsp; | grep -e '\&lt;tm_init\&gt;' -e '\&lt;tm_finalize\&gt;'<BR>
<BR>
prints:<BR>
<BR>
0000000000000cd0 T tm_finalize<BR>
0000000000001270 T tm_init<BR>
<BR>
Is it possible that on an EM64T Linux system the configure script require that lib/libpbs.a or lib64/libpbs.a be a 64 bit library to be happy (lib64/libpbs.a doesn't exist and lib/libpbs.a is a 32 bit library on our system since the OpenPBS version we use is a bit old (2.3.x) and didn't appear to be 64 bit clean) ?<BR>
