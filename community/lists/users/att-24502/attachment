<div style="word-wrap:break-word">I&#39;m unaware of any OMPI error message like that - might be caused by something in libevent as that could be using epoll, so it could be caused by us. However, I&#39;m a little concerned about the use of the prerelease version of Slurm as we know that PMI is having some problems over there.<div>

<br><div><br></div><div>The first one, appeared immediately at the beginning had no effect. The application started to compute and it successfully called a big parallel eigensolver. The second message appeared after 18~19 hours of non-stop computation and the application crashed without showing any other error message! Regularly I was checking that MPI processes were not stuck, after this message the processes were all aborted without dumping anything on stdout/stderr. It is quite weird.</div>
<div><br></div><div>I believe these messages come from Open MPI (but correct me if I am wrong!). I am going to look at the application and the various libraries to find out if something is wrong.
