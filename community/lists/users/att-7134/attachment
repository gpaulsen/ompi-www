Hello,<br>I am new at using open-mpi and will like to know something basic.<br><br>What is the equivalent of the &quot;mpif.h&quot; in open-mpi which is normally &quot;included&quot; at <br>the beginning of mpi codes (fortran in this case). <br>
<br>I shall appreciate that for cpp as well.<br><br>Thanks<br>Ben<br>
