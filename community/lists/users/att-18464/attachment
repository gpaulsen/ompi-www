<div dir="ltr">Hello,<br><br>I&#39;m trying to run my application on different nodes; each with a different path to OpenMPI libraries and binaries.<br>According to the documentation I can set &#39;-prefix&#39; on a per-context basis, so I can set &#39;-prefix&#39; differently<br>
for each node, but I wasn&#39;t able to do it and I didn&#39;t find an example<br><br>What is the correct syntax to set different &#39;-prefixes&#39; arguments for each node?<br>Thank you,<br></div>
