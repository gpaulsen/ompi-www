 [OMPI users] Open MPI 2009 released<br></font><br>
The Open MPI Team, representing a consortium of bailed-out banks, car<br>manufacturers, and insurance companies, is pleased to announce the<br>release of the "unbreakable" / bug-free version Open MPI 2009,<br>(expected to be available by mid-2011).&nbsp; This release is essentially a<br>complete rewrite of Open MPI based on new technologies such as C#,<br>Java, and object-oriented Cobol (so say we all!).&nbsp; Buffer overflows<br>and memory leaks are now things of the past.&nbsp; We strongly recommend<br>that all users upgrade to Windows 7 to fully take advantage of the new<br>powers embedded in Open MPI.<br><br>This version can be downloaded from the The Onion web site or from<br>many BitTorrent networks (seeding now; the Open MPI ISO is<br>approximately 3.97GB -- please wait for the full upload).<br><br>Here is an abbreviated list of changes in Open MPI 2009 as compared to<br>the previous version:<br><br>- Dropped support for MPI 2 in favor of the
 newly enhanced MPI 11.7<br> standard.&nbsp; MPI_COOK_DINNER support is only available with additional<br> equipment (some assembly may be required).&nbsp; An experimental PVM-like<br> API has been introduced to deal with the current limitations of the<br> MPI 11.7 API.<br>- Added a Twitter network transport capable of achieving peta-scale<br> per second bandwidth (but only on useless data).<br>- Dropped support for the barely-used x86 and x86_64 architectures in<br> favor of the most recent ARM6 architecture.&nbsp; As a direct result,<br> several Top500 sites are planning to convert from their now obsolete<br> peta-scale machines to high-reliability iPhone clusters using the<br> low-latency AT&amp;T 3G network.<br>- The iPhone iMPI app (powered by iOpen MPI) is now downloadable from<br> the iTunes Store.&nbsp; Blackberry support will be included in a future<br> release.<br>- Fix all compiler errors related to the PGI 8.0 compiler by<br> completely
 dropping support.<br>- Add some "green" features for energy savings.&nbsp; The new "--bike"<br> mpirun option will only run your parallel jobs only during the<br> operation hours of the official Open MPI biking team.&nbsp; The<br> "--preload-result" option will directly embed the final result in<br> the parallel execution, leading to more scalable and reliable runs<br> and decreasing the execution time of any parallel application under<br> the real-time limit of 1 second.&nbsp; Open MPI is therefore EnergyStar<br> compliant when used with these options.<br>- In addition to moving Open MPI's lowest point-to-point transports to<br> be an external project, limited support will be offered for<br> industry-standard platforms.&nbsp; Our focus will now be to develop<br> highly scalable transports based on widely distributed technologies<br> such as SMTP, High Performance Gopher (v3.8 and later), OLE COMM,<br> RSS/Atom, DNS, and Bonjour.<br>- Opportunistic
 integration with Conflicker in order to utilize free<br> resources distributed world-wide.<br>- Support for all Fortran versions prior to Fortran 2020 has been<br> dropped.<br><br>Make today an Open MPI day!<br><br><br>_______________________________________________<br>users mailing list<br><a ymailto="mailto:users@open-mpi.org" href="mailto:users@open-mpi.org">users@open-mpi.org</a><br><a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/users" target="_blank">http://www.open-mpi.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/users</a><br></div></div></div></body></html>
