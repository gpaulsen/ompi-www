The openib BTL and BLCR support in Open MPI were working about a year ago (when I last checked). The psm BTL is not supported at the moment though.<div><br></div><div>From the error, I suspect that we are not fully closing the openib btl driver before the checkpoint thus when we try to restart it is looking for a resource that is no longer present. I created a ticket for us to investigate further if you want to follow it:</div>

But I will keep an eye on the ticket and see what I can do. If it is what I think it is, then it should not take too much work to get it working again.</div>

I&#39;m trying to build openmpi with support for BLCR plus qlogic infiniband (plus grid engine).  Everything seems to compile OK and checkpoints are taken but whenever I try to restore a checkpoint I get the following error:<div>

- do_mmap(&lt;file&gt;, 00002aaab18c7000, 0000000000001000, ...) failed: ffffffffffffffea<div>- mmap failed: /dev/ipath</div><div>- thaw_threads returned error, aborting. -22</div><div>- thaw_threads returned error, aborting. -22</div>

<div>1)Are Infiniband and BLCR support in openmpi compatible?</div><div>2)Are there any special tricks necessary to get them working together.</div><div><br></div>
