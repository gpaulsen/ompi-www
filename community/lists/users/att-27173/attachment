      Can you send more details about the incompatibility between hwloc
      old and recent versions? Maybe there's a workaround there.<br>
      hwloc is supposed to maintain compatibility but we've seen cases
      where XML export/import doesn't work because the old version
      exports buggy XMLs that the recent version considers as invalid.<br>
      Do you get hwloc warnings or error messages?<br>
      Brice<br>

        <p>Hi everyone, <br>
          <br>
          We recently upgraded the hwloc library used by the schedulers
          (along with openmpi and all applications compiled with it),
          but apparently Abaqus is using an internal MPI (PMPI) which
          still points to old hwloc versions that are not compatible. As
          a result, Abaqus either crashes or runs extremely slow. <br>
          <br>
          Abaqus documentation suggests that it may be possible to run
          it using an external MPI stack, and I am hoping to make it
          work with our stock openmpi/1.8.4 that knows how to talk with
          the scheduler's hwloc. Unfortunately, however, all of my
          attempts failed miserably so far (no specific instructions for
          openmpi). <br>
          <br>
          I was wondering if anyone had success with getting Abaqus
          running with openmpi. Even the information of whether it is
          possible or not will help us a great deal.
          <br>
          <br>
          Thanks for your help! <br>
          <br>

        <p>PS: I sent a similar question to the mvapich2 list as well.
          If they respond with some information that can be applied to
          openmpi, I will happily share them here.
