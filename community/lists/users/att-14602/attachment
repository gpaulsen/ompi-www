Hello, <br />I am a beginner using Open MPI to set up a simple Beowulf cluster of PCs for my Distributed Systems lab. My head node is my x86_64 architecture Fedora 12 machine. The rest of my nodes are i386 Fedora 13 machines. I understand that I need to compile Open MPI with CFLAGS=-m32 so that I can use -m32 flag to create a 32 bit compatible binary. I could not do this using yum install. So I am using the tarball for Open MPI 1.5. <br />my configure command is as follows - <br /><br />./configure --prefix=/home/wolf/openmpi/ CFLAGS=-m32 CXXFLAGS=-m32 FFLAGS=-m32 FCFLAGS=-m32<br /><br />This works fine. However, while doing make I get the following errors - <br /><br />/usr/bin/ld: i386:x86-64 architecture of input file `../opal/libltdl/.libs/libltdlc.a(libltdlc_la-preopen.o)&#39; is incompatible with i386 output<br />/usr/bin/ld: i386:x86-64 architecture of input file `../opal/libltdl/.libs/libltdlc.a(libltdlc_la-lt__alloc.o)&#39; is incompatible with i386 output<br />/usr/bin/ld: i386:x86-64 architecture of input file `../opal/libltdl/.libs/libltdlc.a(libltdlc_la-lt_dlloader.o)&#39; is incompatible with i386 output<br />/usr/bin/ld: i386:x86-64 architecture of input file `../opal/libltdl/.libs/libltdlc.a(libltdlc_la-lt_error.o)&#39; is incompatible with i386 output<br />/usr/bin/ld: i386:x86-64 architecture of input file `../opal/libltdl/.libs/libltdlc.a(libltdlc_la-ltdl.o)&#39; is incompatible with i386 output<br />/usr/bin/ld: i386:x86-64 architecture of input file `../opal/libltdl/.libs/libltdlc.a(libltdlc_la-slist.o)&#39; is incompatible with i386 output<br />/usr/bin/ld: i386:x86-64 architecture of input file `../opal/libltdl/.libs/libltdlc.a(lt__strl.o)&#39; is incompatible with i386 output<br />/usr/bin/ld: i386:x86-64 architecture of input file `../opal/libltdl/.libs/libltdlc.a(libltdlcS.o)&#39; is incompatible with i386 output<br />/usr/bin/ld: i386:x86-64 architecture of input file `../opal/libltdl/.libs/libltdlc.a(dlopen.o)&#39; is incompatible with i386 output<br />/usr/bin/ld: i386:x86-64 architecture of input file `asm/.libs/libasm.a(atomic-asm.o)&#39; is incompatible with i386 output<br />/usr/bin/ld: i386:x86-64 architecture of input file `event/.libs/libevent.a(signal.o)&#39; is incompatible with i386 output<br />/usr/bin/ld: i386:x86-64 architecture of input file `event/.libs/libevent.a(epoll.o)&#39; is incompatible with i386 output<br />/usr/bin/ld: i386:x86-64 architecture of input file `event/.libs/libevent.a(poll.o)&#39; is incompatible with i386 output<br />/usr/bin/ld: i386:x86-64 architecture of input file `event/.libs/libevent.a(select.o)&#39; is incompatible with i386 output<br />/usr/bin/ld: final link failed: Invalid operation<br />collect2: ld returned 1 exit status<br />make[2]: *** [libopen-pal.la] Error 1<br />make[2]: Leaving directory `/home/wolf/Downloads/openmpi-1.5/opal&#39;<br />make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1<br />make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/wolf/Downloads/openmpi-1.5/opal&#39;<br />make: *** [all-recursive] Error 1<br /><br /><br />Any idea as to how to go around fixing this? Any help would be greatly regarded, since I&#39;m supposed to meet a deadline, and half of my semester has been spent trying to get either LAM-MPI or Open MPI (which I was suggested I shift to) to work.<br />Thank you very much. <br /><br />Regards, <br />Saahil
