<br>Hi Sangamesh,<br><br>&nbsp; I think the problem is that you&#39;re loading a different version of OpenMPI at runtime:<br><br><i>[master:17781] [ 1] /usr/lib64/openmpi/libmpi.so.0 [0x34b19544b8]</i><br><br>&nbsp; .. The path there is to &#39;/usr/lib64/openmpi&#39;, which is probably a system-installed GCC version.&nbsp; You want to use your version in:<br>
<br><i>&nbsp;/opt/openmpi_intel/1.2.8/</i><br><br>&nbsp; You probably just need to re-set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to reflect this new path, such as:<br><i><br>(for bash)<br>export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/openmpi_intel/1.2.8/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}</i><br>
<br>&nbsp; ... By doing this, it should find the proper library files (assuming that&#39;s the directory they&#39;re in - check your instal!).&nbsp; You may also wish to remove the old version of OpenMPI that came with the system - a yum &#39;list&#39; command should show you the package, and then just remove it.&nbsp; The &#39;feupdateenv&#39; thing is more of a red herring, I think... this happens (I think!) because the system uses a Linux version of the library instead of an Intel one.&nbsp; You can add the flag &#39;-shared-intel&#39; to your compile flags or command line and that should get rid of that, if it bugs you.&nbsp; Someone else can, I&#39;m sure, explain in far more detail what the issue there is.<br>
<br>&nbsp; Hope that helps.. if not, post the output of &#39;ldd hellompi&#39; here, as well as an &#39;ls /opt/openmpi_intel/1.2.8/&#39;<br><br>&nbsp; Cheers!<br>&nbsp; - Brian<br><br><br><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Sun, Dec 7, 2008 at 9:50 AM, Sangamesh B <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:forum.san@gmail.com">forum.san@gmail.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br>

<br>
Installed Open MPI 1.2.8 with Intel C++compilers on Cent OS 4.5 based<br>
Rocks 4.3 linux cluster (&amp; Voltaire infiniband). Installation was<br>
smooth.<br>
<br>
The following error occurred during compilation:<br>
<br>

<br>
It produced the executable. But during execution it failed with<br>

mpirun noticed that job rank 0 with PID 17781 on node master exited on<br>
signal 11 (Segmentation fault).<br>
1 additional process aborted (not shown)<br>
<br>
But this is not the case, during non-mpi c code compilation or execution.<br>
<br>
# icc sample.c -o sample<br>
# ./sample<br>
<br>
Compiler is working<br>
#<br>
<br>
What might be the reason for this &amp; how it can be resolved?<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
