i have 3 nodes, one is master node and another is computing nodes,these nodes deployed in the internet (not in cluster)<div><br></div><div>when i running NPB (NASA parallel benchmark) in one node (use 2 processes)</div><div>&nbsp;mpirun -np 2 &nbsp;exe.&nbsp;</div><div>I can get the successful result, but when i running in two nodes(for example running on B and C nodes) i got a fail</div><div>mprirun -nolocal -hostfile hostfile -np 2 exe.</div><div>the fail information is :</div><div>B [0,1,0] connectimeout ,connect() fail errno=110&nbsp;</div><div>C [0,1,1] connectimeout ,connect() fail errno=110</div><div>but the connect between B and &nbsp;C has no problem, because i can use ping and ssh form B to C (or C to B).</div><div>I think this problem may be caused by the para connectimeout (so little that lead &nbsp;fail?). Because my nodes&nbsp;deployed on internet so delay is bigger.&nbsp;</div><div>who can help me attack this problem and how to set the connectimeout in openmpi?</div><div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div><br><br><span title="neteasefooter"><span id="netease_mail_footer"><hr/>
