<DIV>My default gcc is 2.95.3, so I installed a newer version in my own home directory, it's gcc-3.4.4. Now I want to install openmpi and compile it with this new version. I dont know how to force it not to pick the default one. I want it to use the 3.4.4 version. Please let me know what to do exactly. Thanks.</DIV></td></tr></table><br>
