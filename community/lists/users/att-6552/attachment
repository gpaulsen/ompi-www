It's not clear exactly what you did here.  Did you just replace  
MPICH's "mpiCC" with OMPI's "mpiCC"?  FWIW, this is
almost always the  
easiest way to compile MPI applications: use that implementation's  
"wrapper" compiler (I'm assuming you have a C++ code in this
case).

These errors should not normally happen; they look kinda like you're  
somehow inadvertently mixing Open MPI and MPICH.
