<div>&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear Daniel and other users, As I can see the h2pas present on the Lazarus can make a good job converting the h files into the pas files. Also on the Lazarus home page there is some examples on using it with the MPICH 2. (
<a href="http://wiki.lazarus.freepascal.org/Creating_bindings_for_C_libraries">http://wiki.lazarus.freepascal.org/Creating_bindings_for_C_libraries</a>) Does anybody tried something similar?? Like convert the h files present on the C:\Program Files\MPICH2\include, for instance??

<div>Thanks</div>
