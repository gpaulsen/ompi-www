<div class="PlainText">Regarding the permission, I think I have the permission to run the at command because I can use the at command to schedule other programs except mpi program.<br>
<br>
Is there any other scheduling command to schedule task?<br>
<br>
Thank you in advance.<br>
<br>
Best Regards,<br>

<div style="word-wrap:break-word">Perhaps I don't understand, but mpirun has no problem being executed using the &quot;at&quot; command. Perhaps the problem is that you don't have permission for &quot;at&quot;? Per the man page:
<div><br>
</div>
<div>
<div>&nbsp; The superuser may use these commands in any case. &nbsp;For &nbsp;other &nbsp;users, &nbsp;permission &nbsp;to &nbsp;use &nbsp;at &nbsp;is &nbsp;determined &nbsp;by &nbsp;the &nbsp;files &nbsp;/etc/at.allow &nbsp;and</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;/etc/at.deny.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If the file /etc/at.allow exists, only usernames mentioned in it are allowed to use at.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If /etc/at.allow does not exist, /etc/at.deny is checked, every username not mentioned in it is then allowed to use at.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If neither exists, only the superuser is allowed use of at.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;An empty /etc/at.deny means that every user is allowed use these commands, this is the default configuration.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>You also might check to see what directory mpirun is executed from when &quot;at&quot; actually runs, and that the path to both mpirun and your executable are correct for that location.</div>

<div dir="ltr">Hi all,
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Due to the time constraints, I would like to run the mpi program by scheduling the program to run on desired time using the &quot;at&quot; command. However, it seems that the mpirun doesn't execute the mpi program at the desired time using the &quot;at&quot; command.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>I would like to ask is there any other method to schedule a program to run ?</div>
<div>For best, it can straight away starts the second mpi program once the previous program is finished.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Hope to get some reply from you all.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance.</div>
