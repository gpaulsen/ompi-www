<br>Thanks Paul, <div>yes I use Intel 12.1.0, and this error is intermittent, not always produced but most of the times it occurs.<div>My program is large and contains many files that are related to each other, I don&#39;t think it will help if I take the snippet of the code. The program run parallel matrix multiplication algorithms. I don&#39;t know if it is because of my code or not, but I run the program for small matrices sizes and the program completes until the end without error while for large inputs it will hang or give that sigv.</div>
<div><br></div><div><div><div>Regards,</div></div></div><div>Anas</div></div>
