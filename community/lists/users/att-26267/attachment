<div dir="ltr">I think I fixed some of the handshake issues - please give it another try. You should see orte-submit properly shutdown upon completion, and orte-dvm properly shutdown when sent the terminate cmd.

&gt; Okay, thanks - I&#39;ll get on it tonight. Looks like a fairly simple bug, so hopefully I&#39;ll have it ironed out tonight.<br>
<br>
</span>Sorry, I was not completely accurate. Let me be more specific:<br>
<br>
* The orte-submit does not return though, so that symptom is similar.<br>
<br>
* On my laptop I dont get the libevent warnings (the output redirection hid that fact).<br>
<br>
* The &quot;-np&quot; behavior is different too, but I guess that is because there is no RM in place on my laptop.<br>
