I have a small program that I&#39;d like to use two level of parallelization. <br><br>I&#39;m doing some image analysis where I&#39;d like to have the image analsys being parallized and the search through a collection of images.<br>
<br>Currently I have a custum C++ class that does the image manipulation on each file I&#39;m looking at.<br><br>so.. basic pseudo code<br><br>main:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; get src image<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; process image<br><br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; compare src to dst (and repeat for 1 of 1000 different dst objects) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>the search seems easy enough to parallelize, but I would need to do the image analysis split among processors.&nbsp; Would there be any problems with having MPI initiated and finalized within a class?<br><br>sorry if this is confusing, just wanted to run my ideas by some far more capable individuals, making sure my approach makes some sense.<br>
<br>Thanks again,<br><br>--<br>Samir<br>
