I am working on obtaining a developer or time for myself to work on restoring support for MPI using Xgrid. &nbsp;Do we have any documentation on the Xgrid supporting section of Open-MPI, and could you point out to me what sections of MPI that were providing the said support in the first place. &nbsp;<br>

Thank you,<br>
