Hi,<br>Iam very new to parallel computing and MPI, with intested i have written an sorting algorithm with MPI. The problem is i tried reduce the execution time i.e sorting with increase in nodes but the problem is iam unable drease the time and i was getting like for 4nodes(1Master and 2 slaves) was getting an avg of 6.56 sec , for  8nodes(1Master and 7 slaves) was getting an avg of 6.62 sec and for 15nodes(1Master and 15 slaves) was getting an avg of 6.63 sec. i am unable for  find out an clue according to theory time has been decreased for the increase in nodes but iwas getting an increase or constant. Please help me solving this.<br>
