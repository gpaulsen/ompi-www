to cause problems, the underlying hardware would need to have very unusual
characteristic that the MPI implementation is exploiting. &nbsp;People
have imagined hardware characteristics that could make reading an Isend
buffer a problem but I have never heard of real hardware where it would
be. &nbsp;(Imagine hardware where posting an ISEND causes addressability
of the underlying memory to be handed over to an adapter until the send
is done. The processor loses addressability. &nbsp;No such real hardware
I ever heard of but if there were, the send buffer access rule would be
relevant)</font>

rule is to restrictive.</font>
