<br>
why are You running ssh command before mpirun command? I&#39;m interested in<br>
setting up a paraview server on a LAN to pos-tprocess OpenFOAM<br>
simulation data.<br>
<br>
Just a total newbish comment: doesn&#39;t the mpirun in fact call for the<br>
ssh anyway? And if pvserver is to be run on multiple machines and is<br>
programmed in Open MPI shouldn&#39;t<br>
<br>
mpirun -np procNumber -H host1,host2,host3 pvserver<br>
<br>
be enough to get it going, as well as any other parallel program? Again,<br>
please excuse my newbiness.<br>
<br>
Best regards,<br>

ssh cloud3 mpirun pvserver<br><br>If you use simply<br>mpirun pvserver<br><br>that will start the server on daviddoria.<br><br>Can anyone confirm or deny?<br><br clear="all">Thanks,<br><br>David <br></div></div>
