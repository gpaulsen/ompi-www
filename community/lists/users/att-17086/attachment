Thanks Jeff,<br><br>I know it depends and I want to know exactly what is the dependency and general complexity analysis.<br><br>Is it really no documentation at all ? For example you said &quot;to be replaced soon&quot;, then what is the algorithms that will be used to replace ? Is there any publication available ? In another words, how do you know they will be replaced by which algorithm, please teach me !<br>

<br>
</div>Unfortunately, you probably won&#39;t.<br>
<div class="im"><br>
&gt; For example, I would like to answer following questions: how MPI_Algather operation is done? what is the complexity in term of the number of data send/receive given a number of node involved? what is the data structure behind ?. Same as for MPI_Alreduce etc..<br>

<br>
</div>All of OMPI&#39;s collectives are implemented as plugins under the ompi/mca/coll/ tree.  There are several different plugins in that tree -- each one has its own directory (with the exception of &quot;base&quot;, which is glue code for the whole collective algorithm framework).<br>

<br>
You probably want to look in the &quot;tuned&quot; component for OMPI&#39;s current-generation algorithms (to be replaced soon, but that&#39;s what&#39;s mostly used today).  &quot;tuned&quot; has many different algorithm implementations for each MPI collective, and uses sophisticated run-time checking to determine which to use.<br>

<br>
So the answer to your original query -- how is the MPI_Allgather operation done?  -- is, &quot;it depends&quot; on things like message size, number of peers, etc.  :-)<br>
