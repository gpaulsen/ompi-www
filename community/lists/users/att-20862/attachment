All<br><br>Since I did not see any Microsoft/other &#39;official&#39; folks pick up the ball, let me step up. I have been lurking in this list for quite a while and I am a generic scientific programmer (i.e. I use many frameworks such as OpenCL/OpenMP etc, not just MPI)<br>
Although I am primarily a Linux user, I do own multiple versions of Visual Studio licenses and have a small cluster that dual boots to Windows/Linux (and more nodes can be added on demand). I cannot do any large scale testing on this, but I can build and run regression tests etc.<br>
<br>If the community needs the Windows support to continue, I can take up that responsibility, until a more capable person/group is found at least.<br><br>Thanks<br>Durga<br><br><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Mon, Dec 3, 2012 at 12:32 PM, Damien <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:damien@khubla.com" target="_blank">damien@khubla.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br>

I completely missed the message about Shiqing departing as the OpenMPI Windows maintainer.  I&#39;ll try and keep Windows builds going for 1.6 at least, I have 2011 and 2013 Intel licenses and VS2008 and 2012, but not 2010.  I see that the 1.6.3 code base already doesn&#39;t build on Windows in VS2012  :-(.<br>

<br>
While I can try and keep builds going, I don&#39;t have access to a Windows cluster right now, and I&#39;m flat out on two other projects. I can test on my workstation, but that will only go so far. Longer-term, there needs to be a decision made on whether Windows gets to be a first-class citizen in OpenMPI or not.  Jeff&#39;s already told me that 1.7 is lagging behind on Windows.  It would be a shame to have all the work Shiqing put in gradually decay because it can&#39;t be supported enough.  If there&#39;s any Microsoft/HPC/Azure folks observing this list, or any other vendors who run on Windows with OpenMPI, maybe we can see what can be done if you&#39;re interested.<span class="HOEnZb"><font color="#888888"><br>
