Hi,<br><br>I am using the OpenMPI v1.4a1r22335 to run an MPI application that creates <br>dynamically processes.<br>The application behavior is like explained in a previous e-mail<br><a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/users/2009/12/11540.php">http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/users/2009/12/11540.php</a><br>

<br>The application is launched by a command line such as:<br><br>  $ mpirun -hostfile myhosts -np 1 myapp<br><br>myhosts describes 2 nodes:<br>node1 slots=8<br>node2 slots=8<br><br>My application runs as expected creating dynamic processes into the two nodes. <br>

After compute, all processes (static and dynamic ones) finalizes too -- confirmed <br>looking &#39;top&#39; and &#39;ps&#39; commands.<br>But, the mpirun remains running and the application never liberate the shell. <br>
I try use mpiexec, but it also hangs.<br>
If I run locally (without -hostfile), the mpirun does not hang!<br><br>Someone could help me?!<br><br>For awhile, I create a script to kill the mpirun to enable the execution of many consecutive mpirun calls, <br>but it is not a &quot;beautiful&quot; solution :)<br>

<br>thanks<br><br>márcia<br><br><br><br><br>
