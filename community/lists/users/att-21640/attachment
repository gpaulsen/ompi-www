We don't have a way to test it any more (all our LSF access is gone). I recently was briefly given access to an LSF machine and fixed it for the 1.7 series, but that series doesn't support checkpoint/restart.<div><br></div><div><br><div><div>On Mar 30, 2013, at 1:01 AM, Jorge Naranjo Bouzas &lt;<a href="mailto:jonarbo@gmail.com">jonarbo@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:</div><br class="Apple-interchange-newline"><blockquote type="cite"><div dir="ltr"><p class="">Hello!</p><p class="">We are having problems integrating BLCR + OpenMPI + LSF in a linux cluster with Infiniband<br></p><p class="">We compiled OpenMPI version 1.6 with gcc version 4.6.0 ...
