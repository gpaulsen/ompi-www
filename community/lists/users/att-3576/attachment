<span class="gmail_quote"></span>Hi,<br>I&#39;m using Open MPI in a real time rendering system and I need an accurate latency control.<br><br>consider the &#39;Nagle&#39; optimization
 implemented in the TCP/IP protocol, which delays small packets for a short time period to possibly combine them with successive packets generating network friendly
 packet sizes. <br>This optimization can result in a better throughput when lots of small packets are sent, but can also lead to considerable latencies, if&nbsp; packets get delayed
 several times. <br><br><br><br>For example, I want to turn the Nagle optimization on for sockets
 in which updated scene data is streamed to the clients, as throughput is the main issue here. <br>On the other hand, I want turn it off for 
e.g. sockets used to send tiles to the clients, as this has to be done with an absolute minimum of latency. <br><br>Can I do it with OpenMPI?<br>Am I using the the wrong tool?<br><br><br>Thanks in advance<br><span class="sg">
