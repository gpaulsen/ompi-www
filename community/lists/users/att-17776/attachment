I&#39;m trying to establish communications between two mpi processes using<br>MPI_Open_port / MPI_Publish_name / MPI_Comm_accept<br>in a server and <br clear="all">MPI_Lookup_name / MPI_Comm_connect<br>in a client.<br>The source code is in fortran, and the client fails with some sort of &quot;malloc error&quot;.<br>
It seems that the different values for the MPI_MAX_PORT_NAME constants between C (1024) and Fortran (255) is the reason for the problem.<br>Declaring the Port_name variable in Fortran with size 1023 solves this problem, buy I&#39;m not sure if this is the proper way to handle this issue, and I&#39;m not aware of the possible side-effects of changing MPI_MAX_PORT_NAME in .../include/mpi/mpif-common.h<br>
I&#39;m using openmpi 1.4.2 (included in debian stable: 6.0.3) with gfortran 4.4.5 (also the version included in debian stable). Also tried with openmpi 1.4.4 and ifort 11.1<br>-- <br>Enzo A. Dari<br>Instituto Balseiro / Centro Atomico Bariloche<br>
