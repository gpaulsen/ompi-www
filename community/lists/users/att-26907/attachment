<div style="direction:ltr;font-family:Tahoma;color:#000000;font-size:10pt">I&#39;ve compiled the linpack benchmark using openMPI 1.8.5 libraries<br>
and include files on CentOS 6.4.<br>
<br>
I&#39;ve tested the binary on the one Intel node (some<br>
sort of 4-core Xeon) and it runs, but when I try to run it on any of<br>
the old Sunfire opteron compute nodes it appears to hang (although<br>
top indicates CPU and memory usage) and eventually terminates<br>
by itself. I&#39;m also getting the following openMPI error messages/warnings:<br>
<br>
mpirun -np 16 --report-bindings --hostfile hostfile --prefix /hpc/apps/mpi/openmpi/1.8.5-dev --mca btl_tcp_if_include eth0 xhpl<br>

Note these errors also occur when I try to run the linpack benchmark on a single<br>
node as well.<br>
<br>
Does anyone know what&#39;s going on here? Google came up w/nothing and I have no<br>
idea what a BTL coordinating structure is.<br>
