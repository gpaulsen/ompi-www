      <br>
      I would like to run mpi with one process per node, e.g., using<br>
      -cpus-per-rank=1.&nbsp; Then I want to use openmp inside of that.<br>
      But other times I will run with a rank on each physical core.<br>
      <br>
      Inside my code I would like to detect which situation I am in.<br>
      Is there an openmpi api call to determine that?<br>
      <br>
      Thanks.....John<br>
