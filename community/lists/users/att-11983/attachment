Hi.<br><br>Let&#39;s say I have an MPI application that runs on several hosts. I want to suspend the application. I do that by sending to the mpirun process the signal TSTP. Is there any way to measure how long does it take to the application to completely suspend? Doing this &quot;time kill -TSTP PID&quot; will measure just the time for sending the signal, I suppose, right?<br>
<br>Thanks,<br>Andreea<br>
