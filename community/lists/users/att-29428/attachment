    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Greetings! <br>
      </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">We have not upgraded
        our OFED stack for a very long time, and still running on an
        ancient version (1.5.4.1, yeah we know). We are now considering
        a big jump from this version to a tested and stable recent
        version and would really appreciate any suggestions from the
        community. <br>
      </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">In particular, is there
        a particular recent OFED version that's known to work well with
        Open MPI? Any versions we need to avoid? Do we need to recompile
        existing Open MPI stacks? How about existing scientific software
        that are compiled with it? <br>
      </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">We will appreciate
        *any* suggestions/warnings (horror stories?) that you won't mind
        sharing.<br>
      </font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Thank you very much in
        advance!</font></p>
