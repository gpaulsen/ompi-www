Hi all,<br><br>I am working on a parallel tempering MCMC code using OpenMPI scripts. I am a bit confused about proposing swaps between chains running on different cores. <br>I know how to propose swaps but I am not sure as to where to to do it (i.e. how to specify an independent node or core for it.). If some body is/was working on parallel tempering MCMC using MPI then please help me. An example code would be really helpful.<br>
<br>Cheers,<br><br>Asad<br><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Thu, Jul 1, 2010 at 9:28 AM, Riccardo Murri <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:riccardo.murri@gmail.com">riccardo.murri@gmail.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;">
Hello,<br>
<br>
The FAQ states: &quot;Support for MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE [...] has been<br>
designed into Open MPI from its first planning meetings.  Support for<br>
MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE is included in the first version of Open MPI, but<br>
it is only lightly tested and likely still has some bugs.&quot;<br>
<br>
The man page of &quot;mpirun&quot; from v1.4.3a1r23323 in addition says &quot;Open<br>
MPI is, currently, neither thread-safe nor async-signal-safe&quot; (section<br>
&quot;Process Termination / Signal Handling&quot;).<br>
<br>
Are these statements up-to-date?  What is the status of<br>
MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE in OMPI 1.4?<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance for any info!<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
Riccardo<br>
