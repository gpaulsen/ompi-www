The<br>MPI::Simple I mentioned is actually Parallel::MPI::Simple. Both<br>Parallel::MPI and Parallel::MPI::Simple are available from CPAN.<br><br>Prakash<br><br>imran shaik wrote:<br>&gt; Hi Prakash,<br>&gt;   Do i need MPI runtime environment for sure to ue those perl modules??<br>&gt;   Cant i use some other clustring software.?<br>&gt;   Where can i get MPI::Simple??<br>&gt;   <br>&gt;   Imran<br>&gt;   <br>&gt;   &gt;Hello,<br>&gt;   <br>&gt;   &gt;My users use Parallel::MPI and MPI::Simple perl modules consistently<br>&gt;   &gt;without issues.

So i<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; thought of MPI, but i dont know whether it has perl support?<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;       <br>&gt;&gt; Hi Imran,<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; SGE will dispatch process among the nodes of your cluster but it does<br>&gt;&gt; not support interprocess communication, which MPI does. If your<br>&gt;&gt; problem is easily splittable (like parse a large apache log, read a<br>&gt;&gt; large xml list of things) you might be able to split the data and<br>&gt;&gt; spawn as many
 process as you can.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; I do it using LSF (another dispatcher) and a Makefile that controls<br>&gt;&gt; the dependencies and spawn the processes (using make's -j flag) and it<br>&gt;&gt; works quite well. But if your job need the communication (like<br>&gt;&gt; processing big matrices, collecting and distributing data among<br>&gt;&gt; processes etc) you'll need an interprocess communication and that's<br>&gt;&gt; what MPI is best at.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; In a nutshell, you'll need the runtime environment to run MPI programs<br>&gt;&gt; as well as you need SGE's runtime environments on every node to<br>&gt;&gt; dispatch jobs and collect information.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; About MPI bindings for Perl, there's this module:<br>&gt;&gt; http://search.cpan.org/~josh/Parallel-MPI-0.03/MPI.pm<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; but it's far too young to be trustworthy, IMHO, and you'll probably<br>&gt;&gt; need the MPI runtime on all nodes as
