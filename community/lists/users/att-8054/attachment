Hi,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have installed openmpi-1.3. When I checked for the example programs, the output shows only rank 0 of size 1 for 2 processors. When I gave the command: <b>mpirun -hostfile node -np 2 hello_c</b><br>the output is<br>
Hello, world, I am 0 of 1<br>Hello, world, I am 0 of 1<br><br>In my node file, I have<br><b>IP address</b> slots=2 max_slots=2<br>I don&#39;t know why it is not giving as 0 of 2 and 1 of 2.<br>For installation, I gave<br>
<b>configure --prefix=/path<br>make all <br>make install</b><br><br>Thanks for any clarifications and suggestions.<br>Varsha<br>
