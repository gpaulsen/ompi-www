Can you guys be a little more specific about exactly what you are seeing and exactly what you want to see?&nbsp; (And what version you're working with - I'll caveat my discussion that this may be a 1.5-and-forward thing)<BR>

I have to say this is a very common issue for our users.&nbsp; They repeatedly<BR>
report the long Open MPI MPI_Abort() message in help queries and fail to<BR>
look for the application error message about the root cause.&nbsp; A short<BR>
MPI_Abort() message that said &quot;look elsewhere for the real error message&quot;<BR>
would be useful.<BR>
<BR>
Cheers,<BR>

&gt; Dear all,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; I am using the MPI_Abort() command in a MPI program.<BR>
&gt; I would like to not see the note explaining that the command caused Open MPI<BR>
&gt; to kill all the jobs and so on.<BR>
&gt; I thought that I could find a --mca parameter, but couldn't grep it. The only<BR>
&gt; ones deal with the delay and printing more information (the stack).<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Is there a mean to avoid the printing of the note (except the 2&gt;/dev/null<BR>
&gt; tips)? Or to delay this printing?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; Thank you.<BR>
