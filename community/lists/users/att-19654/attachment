I am usually the one that responds to checkpoint/restart questions,<br>
but unfortunately I do not have time to look into this issue at the<br>
moment (and probably won&#39;t for at least a few more months). There are<br>
a few other developers that work on the checkpoint/restart<br>
functionality that might be able to more immediately help you.<br>
Hopefully they will chime in.<br>
<br>
At one point in time (about a year ago) I was able to<br>
checkpoint/restart the NAS benchmarks (and other applications) without<br>
issue. From the error message that you posted earlier, it seems that<br>
something has broken in the 1.6 branch. Unfortunately, I do not have<br>
any advice on an alternative branch to try. The C/R functionality in<br>
the Open MPI trunk is known to be broken. There is a patch for the<br>
trunk making its way through testing at the moment. Once that is<br>
committed then you should be able to use the Open MPI trunk until<br>
someone fixes the 1.6 branch.<br>
<br>
Sorry I cannot be of much help. Hopefully others can assist.<br>

&gt; Dear,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Please help.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I configured the open mpi and it can checkpoint HPL.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; However, whenever I want to checkpoint NAS parallel benchmark it kills the<br>
&gt; application without informative message.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Please how do I configure the openmpi 1.6 to checkpoint NPB? I really need a<br>
&gt; help, I have been on this issue for the past few days without solution<br>
&gt;<br>
