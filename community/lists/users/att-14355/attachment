<FONT FACE="Calibri, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><SPAN STYLE='font-size:11pt'>Greetings all,<BR>
I am working on obtaining a developer or time for myself to work on restoring support for MPI using Xgrid. &nbsp;Do we have any documentation on the Xgrid supporting section of Open-MPI, and could you point out to me what sections of MPI that were providing the said support in the first place. &nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
Thank you,<BR>
