<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" ><tr><td valign="top" style="font: inherit;"><div id="yiv62228572">Hello all,<br><br>I am using OpenMPI 1.4.2 on RHEL. I have a cluster of AMD Opteron's and right now I am just working on getting OpenMPI itself up and running. I have a successful configure and make all install. LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PATH variables were correctly edited. mpirun -np 8 hello_c successfully works on all machines. I have setup my two test machines with DSA key pairs that successfully work with each other.<br><br>The problem comes when I initiate my hostfile to attempt to communicate across machines. The hostfile is setup correctly with &lt;host_name&gt; &lt;slots&gt; &lt;max-slots&gt;. When running with all verbose options enabled "mpirun --mca plm_base_verbose 99 --debug-daemons --mca btl_base_verbose 30 --mca oob_base_verbose 99 --mca pml_base_verbose 99 -hostfile hostfile -np 16 hello_c" I receive the following text

While running top on the machine2 terminal, I see several things come up briefly. These items are: sshd (root), tcsh (myuser), orted (myuser), and mcstransd (root).

This was setup by the sysadmin but it can be worked around if this is necessary.<br><br>So in summary, mpirun works on each machine individually, but hangs when initiated through a hostfile or with the -host flag. ./configure with defaults and --prefix. LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PATH set up correctly. Any help is
 appreciated. Thanks!<br><br></div></td></tr></table><br>
