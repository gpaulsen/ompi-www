Please see attached source file.<br><br>According to my understanding of MPI_Comm_spawn(), the intercommunicator returned is the same as it is returned by MPI_Comm_get_parent() in the spawned processes. I am assuming that there is one intercommunicator which contains all the (spawned) child processes as well as the parent process. If this is the case, then why does an MPI_Bcast() using such an intercommunicator wait indefinately?
<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>
