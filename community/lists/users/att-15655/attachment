<div> </div>
<div>Is there an alternative to MPI_Win_complete that does not &#39;enforce completion of preceding RMS calls at the origin&#39; (as said on pag 353 of the mpi-2.2 standard) ?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I would like to know if I can reuse the buffer I gave to MPI_Put but without blocking on it, if the MPI lib is still using it, I want to be able to continue (and use another buffer).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>thanks,</div>
