I wish to compile openmpi-1.2.2 so that it:<br>- support MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE<br>- enable profiling (generate gmon.out for each process after my client app finish running) to tell apart CPU time of my client program from the MPI library
<br>- static linking for everything (incl client app and all components of library openmpi)<br><br>in the documentation, it says that --enable-mcs-static=&lt;CSV list&gt; will enable static linking of the modules in the list, however what can I specify if I want to statically link *all* mcs modules without knowing the list of modules available?
<br><br>Also this is the plan for my command used for configuring openmpi:<br><br>./configure CFLAGS=&quot;-g -pg -O3 -static&quot; --prefix=./ --enable-mpi-threads --enable-progress-threads --enable-static&nbsp; --disable-shared --enable-mcs-static --with-devel-headers
<br><br>Did you see anything wrong with this command?&nbsp; what else can I modify to satisfy the goals listed above?<br><br>Thanks!<br>
