Jeff,<br><br>Are you looking for pkg for the latest official release (1.10.1 at this time) or pkg with the latest snapshots (and in this case, which branch v1.10 ? v2.x ? master ?<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Gilles<br><br>Jeff Hammond &lt;jeff.science@gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br><div dir="ltr">I setup Travis CI support for ARMCI-MPI but the available version in whatever Ubuntu they use is buggy.  For example: <a href="https://travis-ci.org/jeffhammond/armci-mpi/jobs/88880279">https://travis-ci.org/jeffhammond/armci-mpi/jobs/88880279</a>.<div><div><br></div><div>I have not checked lately, but I believe that Nathan (and perhaps others) have fixed most if not all of the bugs that were blocking ARMCI-MPI from working.  Thus, I&#39;d like to use a recent version of OpenMPI, but I do not want to have to have Travis build it from source for every instance.</div><div><br></div><div>Can anyone suggest easy alternatives to building from source?  Are there deb files online somewhere, perhaps provided by a third-party as for MPICH?  Perhaps there is some obvious trick to get the latest OpenMPI via apt-get.  However, since none of my machines run Ubuntu/Debian anymore, I cannot easily test this, and I do not want to play guess-and-check via repeated pushes to Github to fire up Travis builds.</div><div><br></div><div>If someone knows an easy way to get a late-model OpenMPI in Travis using a method other than what I&#39;ve indicated above, by all means suggest that.  I am still new to Travis CI and would be happy to learn new things.</div><div><div><br></div><div>Thanks,</div><div><br>Jeff<br clear="all"><div><br></div>-- <br><div class="gmail_signature">Jeff Hammond<br><a href="mailto:jeff.science@gmail.com" target="_blank">jeff.science@gmail.com</a><br><a href="http://jeffhammond.github.io/" target="_blank">http://jeffhammond.github.io/</a></div>
