<P>Hello,</P>
<P>OpenMPI output issues when using IBM AIX 5.3</P>
<P>We have recently installed OpenMPI 1.1.2 (see attacched, ompi_inf -a output 
for detail). </P>
<P>on an IBM AIX 5.3. We had no problem during installation and configration. 
"ompi_info -a" runs with no problem.</P>
<P>Running our application we got no error or output from "printf", or 
"cout".</P>
<P>So, we wrote a simple 10 line program, which basicly setup mpi and does a 
</P>
<P>"printf" and "cout". </P>
<P>We still didn't get any output from this program, when using MPI in a none 
debug mode.</P>
<P>I find out that we get the output from this simple program if we add</P>
<P>"--debug-daemons" to the mpirun commands.</P>
<P>But, still for a more complex program we don't get any output even with&nbsp; 
the "--debug-daemons" flag.</P>
<P>My question are </P>
<P>1 - why do we need a debug flag to get any output?</P>
<P>2 - does anyone has any recommendation on how to build an mpi</P>
<P>application for IBM AIX 5.3 to get the output, without any debug flag.</P>
<P>Thanks for any comments</P>
<P>Nader,</P>
