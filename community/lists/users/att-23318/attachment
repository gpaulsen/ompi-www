However, it seems that the mpirun doesn't execute the mpi program at the desired time using the "at" command.<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; I would like to ask is there any other method to schedule a program to run ?<br>&gt; &gt; For best, it can straight away starts the second mpi program once the previous program is finished.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Is this a local machine just for you, a cluster for you or one shared by several users?<br>&gt; <br>&gt; You could also think of implementing a full blown queuingsystem like SoGE https://arc.liv.ac.uk/trac/SGE or Torque http://www.adaptivecomputing.com/products/open-source/torque/<br>&gt; <br>&gt; You don't have to think about a time when the job should start then (even though this is possible with the -a option), but requesting the intended number of cores will allow a job to run as soon as these resources are available. I.e. you can submit several jobs at once but they will be executed one after the other without oversubscribing the available resources.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; -- Reuti<br>&gt; <br>&gt; NB: There is also the command `batch` in the at-suite to start the next job when the load drops under a certain value.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; &gt; Hope to get some reply from you all.<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance.<br>&gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; Best Regards,<br>&gt; &gt; Shi Wei<br>&gt; &gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; &gt; users mailing list<br>&gt; &gt; users@open-mpi.org<br>&gt; &gt; http://www.open-mpi.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/users<br>&gt; <br>&gt; _______________________________________________<br>&gt; users mailing list<br>&gt; users@open-mpi.org<br>&gt; http://www.open-mpi.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/users<br></div></div> 		 	   		  </div></body>
