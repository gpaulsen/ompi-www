<div dir="ltr"><br><div>It&#39;s worth a mention that I made several attempts to add a NASA email address to this list. Nothing ever happened. Nothing bounced. I never got a validation email. Nothing appeared in our spam filter. I emailed webmaster@openmpi and got no reply. There seems to be no contact conduit but these lists. If you can&#39;t join these lists you don&#39;t exist. I added a gmail address and it worked instantaneously.</div></div>
