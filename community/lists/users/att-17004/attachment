Dear Group,<div><br></div><div>My question is that, does SELF checkpointing work only with 'c' or also with 'c++' program?</div><div>I have a simple program written in 'c'. It makes self-checkpoint (run callback functions) when i compile it with mpicc and do checkpointing during run.</div><div>But when i convert same program to .cpp, compile with mpiCC and do checkpointing again, it makes BLCR checkpoint and not self-checkpoint.</div><div>Thanks in advance.</div><div><br></div><div>Regards,</div><div>Faisal</div><div><br></div> 		 	   		  </div></body>
