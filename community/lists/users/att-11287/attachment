&gt; Hi Ritter,<br>
<div class="im">&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; And why those examples in libibverbs-1.1.2 package takes IP address ?<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Do you have any idea about that ?<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Why not?<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; I think hostnames and ips were used because they uniquely identify a<br>
&gt;&gt; node. Why create a parallel naming scheme? It just adds more data to<br>
&gt;&gt; track.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; I agree with this that why there should be parallel naming scheme. But<br>
&gt; Infiniband devices already have LID and GID naming system to identify<br>
&gt; devices<br>
&gt; So instead of using IP address to uniquely identify, we can use those<br>
&gt; LID/GID.<br>
&gt; Am I right ?<br>
<br>
</div>That would have been another possibility.<br>
<br>
You could say the same about the SCSI bus. LUN and bus information is<br>
mapped to an abstract device so that the user does not have to deal<br>
with those low level details. In the case of SCSI, the OS handles<br>
that... maps it into devices. I think IB somewhat follows that model.<br>
