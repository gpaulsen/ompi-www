Good Day:<br><br>I am getting the following error messages every time I run a very simple program that spawns child processes:<br>[turkana:27949] [0,0,0] ORTE_ERROR_LOG: Not found in file base/soh_base_get_proc_soh.c at line 80
<br>[turkana:27949] [0,0,0] ORTE_ERROR_LOG: Not found in file base/oob_base_xcast.c at line 108<br>[turkana:27949] [0,0,0] ORTE_ERROR_LOG: Not found in file base/rmgr_base_stage_gate.c at line 276<br>[turkana:27949] [0,0,0] ORTE_ERROR_LOG: Not found in file base/soh_base_get_proc_soh.c at line 80

<br><br>Also, if I spawn four child processes, not all of them run to completion, i.e. till MPI_Finalize.<br><br>Saadat.<br>
