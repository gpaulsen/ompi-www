    Sorry for the late update. Anyway, per suggestions, here is what I
    did:<br>
    &nbsp;* prevent ssh-login to the nodes except admins<br>
    &nbsp;* reconfigure torque with --with-pam (then reinstall torque,
    openmpi etc...)<br>
    <br>
    After testing for a few days with some intensive jobs, everything
    looks fine :)<br>
    <br>
    Thanks for all the helps/suggestsions/comments,<br>
    <br>

      &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks Reuti and Jeff, you are right, users
      should not be allowed to ssh to all nodes, which is how our
      cluster was set up: users can even password-less ssh to any node.
      I know this is not appropriate question in OpenMPI forum, but how
      can we setup so that user can only ssh (with password) to nodes
      that are allocated to them at the time of qsub'ing? I am still new
      to all of this cluster thing :)<br>
      &gt;&gt;&gt; I even disallow this. Only admin staff is allowed to
      login to the nodes. This forces also the admin to look for a tight
      integration of the user's software into the queuing system.<br>
      &gt;&gt;<br>
      &gt;&gt; +1<br>
      &gt;&gt;<br>
      &gt;&gt; FWIW, that makes one-more-thing that you have to setup
      and maintain (because it doesn't happen by default -- you'd have
      to add some extra scripting in the ssh authentication stuff to
      enable that functionality).<br>
      &gt;&gt;<br>
      <br>
      &gt; Thanks, that what I want to do too, but I thought if it is
      impossible<br>
      &gt; because ssh is needed for seting up a cluster. From what I
      understand:<br>
      <br>
      &gt; * for an user to run pbs jobs, master and clients should have
      that user<br>
      &gt; on their passwd/shadow/group files<br>
      <br>
      Or use NIS / LDAP to have a central location for this information.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      &gt; * configure ssh server on clients to prohibit certain users<br>
      <br>
      Correct, like a line in /etc/ssh/sshd_config:<br>
      <br>
      AllowGroups admin<br>
      <br>
      and only admin staff has this group as one of their secondary
      groups attached.<br>
      <br>
      -- Reuti<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      &gt; Is that right?<br>
