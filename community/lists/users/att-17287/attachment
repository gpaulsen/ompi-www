You could set the setuid bit on the application and chown it to root??  It is about as secure as anything else that has been described thus far.  As a system admin, I cringe at the thought of anything that would allow something to run as someone else,  so there would have to be a pretty good justification for such unique use case as yours.  <br>

&gt; Thanks for trying.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Do you feel that this is an impossible request without the assistance of some process running as root, for example, as Reuti mentioned, the daemons of a job scheduler?  Or are you saying it will just not be as straightforward as calling setgid as you had hoped?<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; Also, do you think there is a way I could make use of the sg command below?  Perhaps there is a way to have the rsh/ssh launcher start the application processes with a command like &#39;sg &lt;group&gt; &lt;executable name&gt;&#39;?<br>

<br>
</div>What about a half-tight integration (or call it: classic tight integration), i.e. no recompilation necessary?<br>
<br>
- setup your mpiexec call in the jobscript to use a plain rsh for the remote startup (no path given): –mca plm_rsh_agent rsh<br>
<br>
- the PE of SGE needs the argument -catch_rsh in start_proc_args and the supplied script in $SGE_ROOT/mpi/startmpi.sh<br>
<br>
 (SGE will create a symbolic link in $TMPDIR therein [which will be called first this way] to the rsh-wrapper in $SGE_ROOT/mpi [pitfall: some applications need a -V to be added in the lines woth &quot;qrsh&quot;, i.e. &quot;qrsh -inherit -V ...&quot; to send all environment variables to the slaves])<br>

<br>
- what is your setting of qrsh_daemon/qrsh_command in `qconf -sconf`? This will then be used finally to reach the node and should be builtin or point to the SGE supplied rsh/rshd (no rshd necessary to install, no rshd is running all the time, no rshd will be started by xinet.d or alike)<br>

<br>
- like you do already: switch off the built-in SGE starter in your mpiexec call: -mca plm_rsh_disable_qrsh 1<br>

</font><br>
PS: To avoid misunderstandings: you could also set &quot;–mca plm_rsh_agent foobar&quot; and in $SGE_ROOT/mpi/startmpi.sh you change it to create a symbolic link called &quot;foobar &quot; in $TMPDIR. It&#39;s just a name at this stage of startup.<br>

&gt; NAME<br>
&gt;      sg - execute command as different group ID<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; SYNOPSIS<br>
&gt;      sg [-] [group [-c ] command]<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; DESCRIPTION<br>
&gt;      The sg command works similar to newgrp but accepts a command. The<br>
&gt;      command will be executed with the /bin/sh shell. With most shells you<br>
&gt;      may run sg from, you need to enclose multi-word commands in quotes.<br>
&gt;      Another difference between newgrp and sg is that some shells treat<br>
&gt;      newgrp specially, replacing themselves with a new instance of a shell<br>
&gt;      that newgrp creates. This doesn&#39;t happen with sg, so upon exit from a<br>
&gt;      sg command you are returned to your previous group ID.<br>

&gt;&gt; Thanks, Ralph,<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; I get the failure messages, unfortunately:<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; setgid FAILED<br>
&gt;&gt; setgid FAILED<br>
&gt;&gt; setgid FAILED<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; I actually had attempted to call setgid from within the application previously, which looks similar to what you&#39;ve done, but it failed. That was when I initiated the post to the mailing list. My conclusion, a guess really, was that Linux would not let me setgid from within my program because I was not root.<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; I was afraid of that - the documentation seemed to indicate that would be the case, but I figured it was worth a quick try. Sorry I can&#39;t be of help.<br>

&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; The attached should set the gid of the remote daemons (and their children) to the gid of mpirun. No cmd line option or anything is required - it will just always do it.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Would you mind giving it a try?<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Please let me know if/how it works.<br>
