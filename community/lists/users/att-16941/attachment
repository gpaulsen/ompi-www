    I'm going to echo what you've already heard here:&nbsp; it is impossible
    for a process to receive a message that was sent to a different
    process.&nbsp; A sender must specify a unique destination.&nbsp; No process
    other than the destination process will see that message.<br>
    <br>
    In what you write below, why do you think you are receiving a
    message that was intended for a different destination?&nbsp; Maybe you
    can put together a short program that illustrates your question.<br>

        Yes, processes receive messages that were not sent to them. I am
        receiving the message with the following call<br>
        <br>
        MPI_Recv(&amp;recv_packet, 1, loadDatatype, MPI_ANY_SOURCE,
        MPI_TAG_LOAD, comm, &amp;status);<br>
        <br>
        and that was sent using the following call,<br>
        <br>
        MPI_Ssend(&amp;load_packet, 1, loadDatatype, rec_rank,
        MPI_TAG_LOAD, comm);<br>
        <br>
        What problem it can have ?. All the parameters are correct, I
        have seen them by printf.&nbsp; What I am thinking is that, the
        receive is done with MPI_ANY_SOURCE, so the process is getting
        any message (from any source). What should be done so that only
        that message is captured that had the destination as this
        process.&nbsp;</div>
