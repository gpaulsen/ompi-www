let me describe what i want to do.<br><br>i had taken linux clustering as my final year engineering project as i m really iintrested in 0networking.<br><br>to tell de truth our college does not have any professor with knowledge of clustering.<br>
<br>the aim of our project was just to make a cluster, which we did. not we have to show and explain our project to the professors. so i want somethin to show them how de cluster works... some program or benchmarking s/w.<br>
<br>hope you got the problem.<br>and thanks again, we really appretiate you patience.<br>
