In various interfaces, like network sockets, or threads waiting for data from somewhere, there are various solutions based on _not_ checking the state of the socket or some sort of &nbsp;queue continuously, but sort of getting _interrupted_ when there is data around, or like condition variables for threads.</div>
<div>
I am not very clear on these points, but it seems that in these contexts, continuous polling is avoided and so actual CPU usage is usually not close to 100%.</div>

Why can't something similar be implemented with broadcast for e.g.?</div>

I think there *was* a decision and it effectively changed how sched_yield() effectively operates, and that it may not do what we expect any more.<br>
<br>
See this thread (the discussion of Linux/sched_yield() comes in the later messages):<br>

I believe there's similar threads in the MPICH mailing list archives; that's why Dave posted on the OMPI list about it.<br>
<br>
We briefly discussed replacing OMPI's sched_yield() with a usleep(1), but it was shot down.<br>
