<br>Configure will also take the compilers of your choice, for instance:<br>Csh: setenv F90 gfortran; setenv CC ...<br>Bash: export F90=gfortran; export CC=...<br><br>Then:<br>configure --prefix=/installation/dir ...<br><br>

Or set you PATH variable on your .cshrc/.bashrc<br>to find the OpenMPI bin directory first.<br>Csh (.cshrc/.tcshrc): setenv PATH /openmpi-dir/bin:${PATH}<br>Bash (.bashrc): export PATH=/openmpi-dir/bin:${PATH}<br><br><br>

<div class="h5">Hi everyone,<br>I want to install OpenMPI on my Ubuntu 8.10 64bit PC. My first attempt to install it was through the ubuntu package manager. From the synaptic manager I found, downloaded and installed OpenMPI 1.2.7 version. Unfortunately the installation package did not allow any configuration options in order to define the desired compilers as F77,F90 etc and when I type mpif77 for example I get the message<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Unfortunately, this installation of Open MPI was not compiled with<br>Fortran 77 support.  As such, the mpif77 compiler is non-functional.<br><br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I tried to uninstall this version of the MPI but I was not able to completely remove it. To explain what I mean : after removing it through the synaptic manager when I type the mpirun command in terminal I get the same message as above. Can anyone tell me what files do I have to remove so that I can completely clean my PC from that version and install an other version which will allow customizations? Alternatively is there any way to define the compilers after the MPI installation?<br>
<br>Now regarding a new clean installation of OpenMPI  : What version do you suggest me install on my pc? Is the latest version (1.3.2) stable enough?<br>As far as I have read in the readme/ installation documents to install the version 1.3.2 I have to run the ./configure command adding the --prefix=/installation/location and F77=77 fortran compiler ,etc (where fortran compiler is just the compilers name e.g. ifort not its location on the filesystem) and after that make all install, is that correct? Can I install OpenMPI at any directory or should I install it in the compiler&#39;s installation path?<br>
 Do I have to make any other customization in the .bashrc in order OpenMPI to operate? If yes what do I have to add ?<br><br>I am a relatively new user in linux so detailed instruction would be appreciated. I am looking fowrward hearing from anyone who could help.<br>
Thanks in advance. <br> <br><br></div></div>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>_______________________________________________<br>users mailing list<br><a href="mailto:users@open-mpi.org" target="_blank">users@open-mpi.org</a><br>
