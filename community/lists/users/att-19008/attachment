Hello,<br>  <br>I have 2 windows Xp computers connected through an ethernet network. I have installed openMPI using the windows installer <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v1.5/downloads/OpenMPI_v1.5.4-1_win32.exe">OpenMPI_v1.5.4-1_win32.exe</a> on every computer. I have set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable to &quot;C:\Program Files\OpenMPI_v1.5.4-win32\lib&quot; (this is the directory where the installation extracted my files)<br>
and the PATH &quot;C:\Program Files\OpenMPI_v1.5.4-win32\bin&quot;. I have configured the 2 computers so that I can launch processes remotely. The command used to launch the process is <br><b>mpirun -H Cooler.lan,mugiwara-4adeb0 -n 2 MPI1.exe <br>
</b>where the program simply outputs the rank and the processor name.<br>My problem is that the output is not collected to the stdout of the rank 0 process. On the remote machine I simply see that the process is launched and when execution finishes is destroyed. I want to find a solution to this , because I have no ideea what could be causing this. Please if you could suggest a solution to my problem I would be very thankful.<br>
The process can be launched locally with success. ethNode1.txt contains the ipconfig /all on node 1, ompi_infoNode1.txt contains the result of command <b>ompi_info -v ompi full --parsable </b>and ompi_info.txt the result of ompi_info -all command.<br>
<br>Thank-you in advance.<br><PRE>
