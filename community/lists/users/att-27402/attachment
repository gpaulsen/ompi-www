<div style="direction: ltr;font-family: Tahoma;color: #000000;font-size: 10pt;">Actually, we're still having problems submitting OpenMPI 1.8.7 jobs<br>
to the cluster thru SGE (which we need to do in order to track usage<br>
stats on the cluster). I suppose I'll make a PE w/the appropriate settings<br>
and see if that makes a difference.<br>

<div>Glad to hear your cluster is working - nice to have such challenges to shake the cobwebs out :-)</div>

a special consideration for Son of Grid Engine:
