Hi,<br>i am building a small 16 nodes cluster gentoo based.<br>I succesfully installed openmpi and i succesfully tried some simple small test parallel program on a single host but...<br>i can&#39;t run parallel program on more than one nodes<br>
<br><br>The nodes are cloned (so they are equals).<br>The mpiuser (and their ssh certificates) uses /home/mpiuser that is a nfs share.<br>I modified .bashrc<br><br>-------------------------<br>PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH ; export PATH ; LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH ; export LD_LIBRARY_PATH ;<br>
<br># already present below<br>if [[ $- != *i* ]] ; then<br>        # Shell is non-interactive.  Be done now!<br>        return<br>fi<br>---------------------<br><br>The very very strange behaviour is that using the --debug-daemons let my program run succesfully.....<br>
<br>Thank you in advance and sorry for my bad english<br><br><br><br>
