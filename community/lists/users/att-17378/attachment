&gt; Hi,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I am trying to build Open MPI 1.4.3 with thread support on Windows. A<br>
&gt; trivial test program<br>
&gt; runs if it calls MPI_Init or MP_Init_thread(int *argc, char ***argv, int<br>
&gt; required, int *provide) with<br>
&gt; reguired=0 but hangs if required&gt;0. ompi_info for my build reports that<br>
&gt; there is no thread<br>
&gt; support but MPI_Init_thread returns provide==required.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The only change in the CMake configuration was to check<br>
&gt; OMPI_ENABLE_MPI_THREADS.<br>
&gt; Is there anything else that needs to be done with the configuration?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I have built 1.4.3 with thread support on several linuxes and mac and it<br>
&gt; works fine there.<br>
&gt;<br>
Not all Windows compilers work well enough with all threading models <br>
that you could expect satisfactory results; in particular, the compilers <br>
and thread libraries you use on linux may not be adequate for Windows <br>
thread support.<br>
