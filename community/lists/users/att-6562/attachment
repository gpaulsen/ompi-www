<div dir="ltr">Hi,<div><br></div><div>I am new to MPI and try to get my Open MPI environment up and running. I have two machines Alpha and Beta, on which I have successfully installed Open MPI in /usr/local/openmpi. I have made the ssh setting to not have to enter password manually (using rsa keys), and I have modified the .rc files to get the right path and right LD_LIBRARY_PATH when login using ssh on both machines.&nbsp;
</div><div><br></div><div>In order to check if my installation was working I have started &quot;mpirun hostname&quot; on Alpha and it is working just fine.</div><div>I have tested as well &quot;mpirun hostname&quot; on Beta and it is working fine too.</div>
<div><br></div><div>I have tested &quot;ssh beta env&quot; to check that my setting are correct and it is working as expected.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>BUT when I am running &quot;mpirun -host beta hostname&quot; from Alpha nothing happens. After several minutes I have to kill the &quot;mpirun&quot; process with Ctrl-C (two times). Does any of you run into similar problem and could tell me what I am doing wrong ? It seems that each local installation are working fine but I can not start tasks on other nodes.</div>
<div><br></div><div>The interesting point is that when I run a &quot;ps&quot; on Beta I can see that a &quot;orted&quot; process is started (and stay in process list) for each of my try to run &quot;mpirun&quot; command from Alpha. So somehow Beta gets the command to start orted and does it but then, nothing happens .......</div>
<div><br></div><div>I have been browsing the users list for similar issues and I found one guy describing&nbsp;exactly&nbsp;the same problem but it was no answer to his post.</div><div><br></div><div>Not sure if this is relevant but Alpha and Beta are Sony PS3 machines running Yellow Dog Linux 6.1</div>
<div><br></div><div>Thanks in advance for your help.</div><div><br></div><div>Regards,</div><div>Chris</div></div>
