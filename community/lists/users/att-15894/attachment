The error is telling you that your OS doesn't support queries telling us what cores are on which sockets, so we can't perform a "bind to socket" operation. You can probably still "bind to core", so if you know what cores are in which sockets, then you could use the rank_file mapper to assign processes to groups of cores in a socket.<br>

<br>
It's just that we can't do it automatically because the OS won't give us the required info.<br>
<br>
See "mpirun -h" for more info on slot lists.<br>

&gt; Hi,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I am trying to perform an experiment in which I can spawn 2 MPI processes, one on each socket in a 4 core node<br>
&gt; having 2 dual cores. I used the option &nbsp;"bind to socket" which mpirun for that but I am getting an error like:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; An attempt was made to bind a process to a specific hardware topology<br>
&gt; mapping (e.g., binding to a socket) but the operating system does not<br>
&gt; support such topology-aware actions. &nbsp;Talk to your local system<br>
&gt; administrator to find out if your system can support topology-aware<br>
&gt; functionality (e.g., Linux Kernels newer than v2.6.18).<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Systems that do not support processor topology-aware functionality cannot<br>
&gt; use "bind to socket" and other related functionality.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Can anybody please tell me what is this error about. Is there any other option than "bind to socket"<br>
&gt; that I can use.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Thanks.<br>
