However, barring doing something stupid, I am hopeful we'll be okay if I continue OMPI's practice of staying within the C99 standard. If MSVC won't support that, then we're out of luck anyway because there is no way OMPI is going back to pre-C99 at this stage.<br><br><br>On Jul 17, 2014, at 11:52 AM, Jed Brown &lt;jed@jedbrown.org&gt; wrote:<br><br>&gt; Ralph Castain &lt;rhc@open-mpi.org&gt; writes:<br>&gt; <br>&gt;&gt; Yeah, but I'm cheap and get the Intel compilers for free :-)<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Fine for you, but not for the people trying to integrate your library<br>&gt; in a stack developed using MSVC.<br><br>_______________________________________________<br>users mailing list<br>users@open-mpi.org<br>Subscription: http://www.open-mpi.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/users<br>Link to this post: http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/users/2014/07/24805.php<br></body>
