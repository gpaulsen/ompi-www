Hi, all<br><br>I&#39;m now learning MPI, but I&#39;m not clear 
with the following questions, <br><br>1, suppose a
 MPI program involves several nodes, if one node dead, will the program 
terminate? <br>
<br>2, Is there any possibility to extend or shrink the size of MPI 
communicator size? If so, we can use spare node to replace the dead 
node?  <br><br>Thanks in advance and your reply will be highly appreciated!<br>
<br>Best Regards,<br>Rui Wang<br><br>
