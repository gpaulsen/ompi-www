I ask because:<br>
<br>
- LAM/MPI has been dead for nearly a decade.<br>
- Open MPI is source compatible with LAM/MPI.<br>

&gt; Hi All,<br>
&gt; While OpenMPI is the way forward, there is a fair amount of software out there still compiled against LAM-MPI. As Indiana University has stopped hosting (<a href="http://blogs.cisco.com/performance/a-farewell-to-lammpi" target="_blank">http://blogs.cisco.com/performance/a-farewell-to-lammpi</a>), there is no easy way to get the sources.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I was wondering if someone know of somewhere I could get a full copy of the sources to create an archive mirror?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Regards,<br>
&gt; Cian<br>
