    <p>If you look around on Ebay, you can find old 16-core Opteron
      servers for a few hundred dollars.  It's not screaming
      performance, but 16 cores is enough to get you started on scaling
      and parallelism in MPI.  It's a cheap cluster in a box. <br>

        <div>Say I don't have access to a actual cluster, yet I'm
          considering cloud compute solutions for my MPI program
          ultimately, but such a cost may be highly prohibitive at the
          moment.</div>
        <div>In terms of middle ground, if I am interesting in compute
          only, no storage, what are possible hardware solutions out
          there to deploy my MPI program?<br>
          By no storage, I mean that my control linux box running the
          frontend of the program, but is also part of the mpi
          communicator always gathers all results and stores them
          locally.<br>
          At the moment, I have a second box over ethernet.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div>I am looking at something like Intel Compute Stick (is it
          possible at all to buy a few, is linux running on them, the
          arch seems to be the same x86-64, is there a possible setup
          with tcp for those and have openmpi over tcp)?</div>
        <div><br>
          Is it more cost-effective to look at extra regular linux
          commodity boxes?<br>
          If a no hard drive box is possible, can the executables of my
          MPI program sendable over the wire before running them?</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div>If we exclude GPU or other nonMPI solutions, and cost being
          a primary factor, what is progression path from 2boxes to a
          cloud based solution (amazon and the like...)</div>
        <div><br>
