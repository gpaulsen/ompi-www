<div>I actually misspoke earlier. It turns out our srun is a *Perl* script around the SLURM srun. I'll speak with our admins to see if they can massage the script to not interpret the arguments. If possible, I'll ask them if I can share the script with you
 (privately or on the list) and maybe you can see how it is affecting Open MPI's argument passage.</div>

&gt; Just saw this, sorry. Our srun is indeed a shell script. It seems to be a wrapper around the regular srun that runs a --task-prolog. What it does...that's beyond my ken, but I could ask. My guess is that it probably does something that helps keep our old
 PBS scripts running (sets $PBS_NODEFILE, say). We used to run PBS but switched to SLURM recently. The admins would, of course, prefer all future scripts be SLURM-native scripts, but there are a lot of production runs that uses many, many PBS scripts. Converting
 that would need slow, careful QC to make sure any "pure SLURM" versions act as expected.<br>

Ralph and I haven't had a chance to discuss this in detail yet, but I have thought about this quite a bit.<br>
<br>
What is happening is that one of the $argv OMPI passes is of the form "foo;bar".&nbsp; Your srun script is interpreting the ";" as the end of the command the the "bar" as the beginning of a new command, and mayhem ensues.<br>
<br>
Basically, your srun script is violating what should be a very safe assumption: that the $argv we pass to it will not be interpreted by a shell.&nbsp; Put differently: your "srun" script behaves differently than SLURM's "srun" executable.&nbsp; This violates OMPI's expectations
 of how srun should behave.<br>
<br>
My $0.02 is that if we "fix" this in OMPI, we're effectively penalizing all other SLURM installations out there that *don't* violate this assumption (i.e., all of them).&nbsp; Ralph may disagree with me on this point, BTW -- like I said, we haven't talked about
 this in detail since Tuesday.&nbsp; :-)<br>
<br>
So here's my question: is there any chance you can change your "srun" script to a script language that doesn't recombine $argv?&nbsp; This is a common problem, actually -- sh/csh/etc. script languages tend to recombine $argv, but other languages such as perl and
 python do not (e.g., <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6981533/how-to-preserve-single-and-double-quotes-in-shell-script-arguments-without-the-a" target="_blank">
