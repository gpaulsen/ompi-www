You can modify how many abort status messages you<br>want to receive with the -aborted X option to mpirun, where X is the<br>number of process abort messages you want to see.  The message
 generally<br>includes some information on what happened to your process.<br><br><br>Hope this helps,<br><br>Brian<br><br><br>_______________________________________________<br>users mailing list<br>users@open-mpi.org<br>http://www.open-mpi.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/users<br></blockquote><br><p>&#32;__________________________________________________<br>Do You Yahoo!?<br>Tired of spam?
