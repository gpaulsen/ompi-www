Hi<br><br>Please help.<br><br>I have installed openmpi-1.6, I have also tested the installation with different mpi applications and my application executed successfully.<br><br>Whenever I ran NPB-3.3  LU without checkpointing, NPB-3.3 completes successfully. <br>
however whenever I checkpointing the application, it aborts without checkpointing with the following error<br><br>&quot;mpirun noticed that process rank 1 with PID 1048 on node node1 exited on signal 10 (User defined signal 1).<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>2 total processes killed (some possibly by mpirun during cleanup)&quot;<br><br>However, when I ran HPL and checkpoint - checkpointing was successfully completed as well as the application.<br>
I have tried to resolved this without success.<br><br>Please I need assistance - I am new user of open mpi.<br><br>Regards,<br>Ifeanyi<br><br><br><br>
