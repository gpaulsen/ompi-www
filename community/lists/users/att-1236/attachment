hi,<br><br>i have compiled a program called ParaView (<a href="http://paraview.org" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">paraview.org</a>) with MPI support using OpenMPI 1.0.2, and when i try to run the paraview executable using
<br><br>mpiexec -n 4 paraview<br><br>or<br><br>miprun -np 4 paraview<br>
<br>instead of having one paraview window open with parallel support, there are 4 paraview windows opened, none of which are running with parallel support.&nbsp; attached are the ompi_info and config.log files.&nbsp; below is the text of the cmake call i used to configure paraview:
<br><br>cmake -DVTK_USE_MPI:BOOL=ON<br>-DMPI_INCLUDE_PATH:PATH=/local2/openmpi1.0.2/include/<br><div style="direction: ltr;">-DVTK_MPIRUN_EXE:FILEPATH=/local2/openmpi1.0.2/bin/mpirun<br>-DMPI_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/local2/openmpi1.0.2/lib/libmpicxx.la
<br>/local2/paraview-2.4.3/<br><br>i also edited the ParaView CMakeLists.txt file to contain:<br>SET(CMAKE_C_COMPILER mpicc)<br>SET(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER mpicxx)<br><br>both compiler wrappers are on the top of my PATH.&nbsp; also, as far as PATH goes, yes, i am certain that the mpiexec and paraview binaries are the ones i think they are (
i.e. when I WHICH MPIEXEC it only shows the one i compiled locally, etc).<br><br>anyone have any insight on this?&nbsp; for the record, when i compile paraview with MPI support using mpich2 (1.0.3), and then do mpiexec calling that version of paraview, i get the expected behavior (
i.e. one paraview window running with parallel support).<br><br>thanks in advance,<br>bryan smith<br></div>
