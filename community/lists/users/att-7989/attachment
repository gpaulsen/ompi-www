The parallel run is happily going on.<br><br>The "hello world" and the ring programs in the examples are also working fine!!!<br><br>As you can see in my prev. email, in the code there's an "arch.make" file in which I have to mention the MPI address + scalapack, blacs lapack and
 blas library addresses. Could this "killing" originate from this file. Because the scalapack installer is installed correctly the tests are running fine and the openmpi is functioning.<br><br>I have had enclosed arch.make in my prev. email.<br></div></div></div><br>
