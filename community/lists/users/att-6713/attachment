<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" ><tr><td valign="top" style="font: inherit;">Yes, I am using the wrapper compilers. But in my simulator Makefile.common I am including the files from gcc and g++. Please see my attached makefile. I am also attaching my previouse Makefile.common which I was MPICH instead of openmpi. Please see both of them and see the defferences, you will see that in the new makefile, I am only commenting the MPICH related stuff and replacing gcc and g++ with mpicc and mpic++. Is there anything else I am doing wrong or I am not supposed not have in my new Make file??<BR><BR>--- On <B>Wed, 9/24/08, Jeff Squyres <I>&lt;jsquyres@cisco.com&gt;</I></B> wrote:<BR>

The above looks about right.

Are you compiling your application with the same C++ compiler that you  
compiled Open MPI with?

If you use the --showme:compile|link flags to put OMPI's required  
flags into a building process (i.e., if you're not using OMPI's  
wrapper compilers), it is still strongly recommended that you use the  
same compilers that you used to compile and build Open MPI.  Is there  
a reason you stopped using the wrapper compilers?

Although some users have reported successes with mixing-n-matching  
compilers, it is untested by the Open MPI team and unsupported.
