Thought I would revisit this one.<br>
<br>
We are still having issues with this. It is not clear to me what is leaving the user files behind in /dev/shm.<br>
<br>
This is not something users are doing directly, they are just compiling their code directly with mpif90 (from OpenMPI), using various compilers. Compilers in use are PGI, Intel, SunStudio and Pathscale.<br>
<br>
It looks like every job run leaves something behind in /dev/shm and it slowly fills up. &nbsp; We are just clearing these out at this point.<div></div></blockquote><div><br>Could you not run ipcs with the -p flag every few minutes and try to figure out what the processes are which are leaving these?<br>
(by that I mean catch them when they are live, and the creating process is still on the system)<br><br>(Currently sitting in a training course on Performance Evaluation and Tuning at SGI - so thinking on things like this)<br>
