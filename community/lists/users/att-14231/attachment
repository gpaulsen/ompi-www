          I am working with a Fortran 90 code with many MPI calls like
          this:<br>
          <br>
          call mpi_gatherv(x,nsize(rank+1),<br>

    Compiler can't affect what happens here (unless maybe you use x
    again somewhere).&nbsp; Maybe you mean MPI library?&nbsp; Intel MPI probably
    checks this at run time and issues an error.&nbsp; <br>
    I've dealt with run-time errors (which surfaced along with an ifort
    upgrade) which caused silent failure (incorrect numerics) on openmpi
    but a fatal diagnostic from Intel MPI run-time, due to multiple uses
    of the same buffer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moral: even if it works for you now with
    openmpi, you could be setting up for unexpected failure in the
    future.<br>
