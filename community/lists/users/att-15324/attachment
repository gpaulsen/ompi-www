<font face="Calibri, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><span style="font-size:11pt">Hi,<br>
<br>
I am an mpi newbie. &nbsp;My open MPI is v 1.4.3, which I compiled<br>
on a linux machine.<br>
<br>
I am using a language called R, which has an mpi interface/package.<br>
It appears that it is happy, on the surface, with the open MPI I installed.<br>
<br>
There is an R function called mpi.spawn.Rslaves(). &nbsp;An argument to<br>
this function is nslaves. &nbsp;I can issue, for example,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;mpi.spawn.Rslaves( nslaves=20 )<br>
And it spawns 20 slave processes. &nbsp;The trouble is that it is all on the<br>
same node as that of the master. &nbsp;I want, instead, these 20 (or more)<br>
slaves spawned on other machines on the network.<br>
<br>
It so happens the mpi.spawn.Rslaves() has an extra argument called<br>
hosts. &nbsp;Here’s the definition of hosts from the api document: “NULL or<br>
LAM node numbers to specify where R slaves to be spawned.” &nbsp;I have<br>
no idea what LAM node is, but there &nbsp;is a funciton called lamhosts().<br>
which returns a bit verbose message:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that there is no lamd running on the host compute-0-0.local.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This indicates that the LAM/MPI runtime environment is not operating.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The LAM/MPI runtime environment is necessary for the &quot;lamnodes&quot; command.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Please run the &quot;lamboot&quot; command the start the LAM/MPI runtime<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;environment. &nbsp;See the LAM/MPI documentation for how to invoke<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;lamboot&quot; across multiple machines.<br>
<br>
Here’s my question. &nbsp;Is there such command as lamboot in open MPI 1.4.3?<br>
Or am I using a wrong mpi software? &nbsp;In a FAQ I read that there are other<br>
MPI software (FT-mpi, LA-mpi, LAM-mpi), but I had notion that open MPI<br>
is to have functionalities of all. &nbsp;Is this a wrong impression?<br>
<br>
Thank you for your help.<br>
