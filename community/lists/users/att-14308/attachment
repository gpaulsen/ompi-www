You mean via an API of some kind? Not through an MPI call, but you can do it (though your code will wind up OMPI-specific). Look at the OMPI source code in opal/mca/paffinity/paffinity.h and you&#39;ll see the necessary calls as well as some macros to help parse the results.<div>
<br></div><div>Depending upon what version you are using, there may also be a function in opal/mca/paffinity/base/base.h to pretty-print that info for you. I believe it may only be in the developer&#39;s trunk right now, or it may have made it into the 1.5.0 release candidate....<br>
