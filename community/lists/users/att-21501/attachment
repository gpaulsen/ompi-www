Hi, <br><br>I am running my jobs on openmpi linux platform. I am getting the following errors: <br><br>[compute-12-23.local:10203] *** An error occurred in MPI_Comm_rank<br>[compute-12-23.local:10203] *** on communicator MPI_COMM_WORLD<br>
[compute-12-23.local:10203] *** MPI_ERR_COMM: invalid communicator<br>[compute-12-23.local:10203] *** MPI_ERRORS_ARE_FATAL: your MPI job will now abort<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
mpirun has exited due to process rank 11 with PID 10211 on<br>node compute-12-23.local exiting improperly. There are two reasons this could occur:<br><br>1. this process did not call &quot;init&quot; before exiting, but others in<br>
the job did. This can cause a job to hang indefinitely while it waits<br>for all processes to call &quot;init&quot;. By rule, if one process calls &quot;init&quot;,<br>then ALL processes must call &quot;init&quot; prior to termination.<br>
<br>2. this process called &quot;init&quot;, but exited without calling &quot;finalize&quot;.<br>By rule, all processes that call &quot;init&quot; MUST call &quot;finalize&quot; prior to<br>exiting or it will be considered an &quot;abnormal termination&quot;<br>
<br>This may have caused other processes in the application to be<br>terminated by signals sent by mpirun (as reported here).<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>[compute-12-23.local:10199] 11 more processes have sent help message help-mpi-errors.txt / mpi_errors_are_fatal<br>

<br>Thanks, <br>Praveen<br>
