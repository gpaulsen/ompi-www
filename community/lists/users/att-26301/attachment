<div dir="ltr"><div><div>I want to validate Allinea&#39;s profiler on the complete set of p2p and collective routines available in MPI and went looking for examples of the MPI_Neighbor routines in action. I can find a range of PDF tutorials and papers, but no actual sample codes to try. <br><br></div>The OpenMPI examples for 1.8.4 don&#39;t use MPI_Neighbor routines, is there any plan to add them, or can people reccomend another program I can compile up?<br><br></div>John<br></div>
