Guess I'm not entirely sure I understand how this is supposed to work. All the -x does is tell us to pickup an envar of the given name and forward its value to the remote apps. You can't set the envar's value on the cmd line. So you told mpirun to pickup the value of an envar called "DISPLAY=:0.0".<br>

<br>
So yes - I would expect this would be behaving strangely.<br>
<br>
If you tell us -x DISPLAY, we'll pickup the local value of DISPLAY and forward it. What that will cause your app to do is, I suppose, up to it.<br>

&gt; Hello,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I'm working on an mpi application that opens a glut display on each node of a small cluster for opengl rendering (each node has its own display). My current implementation scales great with mpich2, but I'd like to use openmpi infiniband, which is giving me trouble.<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; I've had some success with the -x DISPLAY=:0.0 parameter to mpirun, which will open the display on up to 2 of my nodes... any 2. &nbsp;But when I attempt to run the application on 4 nodes, the display is non-deterministic. If any open at all process 0 definately will, and sometimes process 3 along with that. &nbsp;I haven't observed much behavior from process 1 or 2.<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; My command:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; mpirun -x DISPLAY=:0.0 -np 4 -hostfile ~/openmpi.hosts ./myapp<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I've tried adding the -d option with no success.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Does anyone have any suggestions or comments? &nbsp;I'll certainly provide more information if required.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Thanks,<br>
&gt; Brad<br>
