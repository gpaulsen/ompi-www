Hmmm...compilation SEEMED to go OK with the following .configure...<br>
<br>
./configure --prefix=/nfsutil/openmpi-1.2.3
--with-mvapi=/usr/local/topspin/ CC=icc CXX=icpc F77=ifort FC=ifort
CFLAGS=-m64 CXXFLAGS=-m64 FFLAGS=-m64 FCFLAGS=-m64 <br>
<br>
And the following looks promising...<br>
<br>
./ompi_info | grep mvapi<br>
MCA btl: mvapi (MCA v1.0, API v1.0.1, Component v1.2.3)<br>
<br>
I have a post-doc that will test some application code in the next day
or so. Maybe the old stuff worked just fine!<br>

  <pre wrap="">Good morning all,

I have been very impressed so far with OpenMPI on one of our smaller 
clusters running Gnu compilers and Gig-E interconnects, so I am 
considering a build on our large cluster. The potential problem is that 
the compilers are Intel 8.1 versions and the Infiniband is supported by 
three year old Topspin (now Cisco) drivers and libraries. Basically, 
this is a cluster that runs a very heavy workload using MVAPICH, thus we 
have adopted the "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" methodology...thus 
all of the drivers, libraries, and compilers are approximately 3 years old.

Would it be reasonable to expect OpenMPI 1.2.3 to build and run in such 
an environment?

Thanks!
