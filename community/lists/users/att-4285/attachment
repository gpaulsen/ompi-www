The CM PML only support networks that do matching in hardware. In &nbsp;<br>
Open MPI temrs, the CM PML require one of the MTL (instead of the BTL &nbsp;<br>
for all others PML). For a full list of supported networks, one can &nbsp;<br>
list the content of the ompi/mca/mtl directory (right now: Myrinet, &nbsp;<br>
Portals and QSLogic).<br>
<br>
If your environment do not dispose of any of these networks, then CM &nbsp;<br>
cannot be used. Moreover, as you force the PML to CM on the command &nbsp;<br>
line, as CM fails to load, Open MPI give up claiming that no PML were &nbsp;<br>
found.<br>

&gt; Hi,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I am trying to use the cm component from pml, but when I execute &nbsp;<br>
&gt; the command: &quot;mpirun -np 2 --mca pml cm ompi_test&quot;, I get
the error &nbsp;<br>
&gt; message that &quot;No available pml components were found&quot;. I
did a &nbsp;<br>
&gt; ompi_info to see if the cm component exist, and it does. The output
&nbsp;<br>
&gt; of &quot;&gt;ompi_info | grep cm&quot; was &quot;MCA pml: cm (MCA
v1.0, API v1.0, &nbsp;<br>
&gt; Component v1.3)&quot;. I have also set my &nbsp;LD_LIBRARY_PATH as
instructed &nbsp;<br>
&gt; by the FAQs. I have even reconfigured and rebuilt open-mpi, but &nbsp;<br>
&gt; that didn't fix the problem either. I am wondering whether a &nbsp;<br>
&gt; process on my system could interfere with opening the cm component.
&nbsp;<br>
&gt; I don't know the answer to this, but thought that I should throw it
&nbsp;<br>
&gt; out there.<br>
&gt; Anyways, I am not sure what to do next to troubleshoot this problem
&nbsp;<br>
&gt; and was hoping that somebody could give me pointers on what might
&nbsp;<br>
&gt; be wrong or what I could check/do next.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Thank You,<br>
&gt;<br>
