Anyway, after compiling my code with icc/11.1.069, the job is running without stuck or that sigv which it occurred before when using icc/12.1.0 module.<div><br><div>Also I have to point that when I was using icc/12.1.0 I was getting strange outputs or stuck, and I solved them by changing the name of parameters inside the function, for example, if I call a func like this </div>
<div><br></div><div>time( ..., size_t *P, ...){}</div><div><br></div><div>and call it like this:</div><div>time(..,p,..);</div><div><br></div><div>then I have to change the name of *P inside the time functions as follows:</div>
<div>time( ..., size_t *P, ...)</div><div>{</div><div>int bestP = *P; // and maybe again as the later bug that I solved</div><div>int bP = bestP;</div><div>// then start using bP :)</div><div>...</div><div>} <br><br><div class="gmail_quote">
Thanks guys for the help, I guess that the problem is solved when compiling with the old one.</div></div></div>
