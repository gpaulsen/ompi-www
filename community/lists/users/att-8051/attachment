Hi All,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a new user of Open MPI. I have installed open mpi-1.3 on a RedHat Linux-5&nbsp; ver system with F77 set as gfortran compiler. I tested the programs in examples and all ran. When I tried the CHARMM program with mpirun (2 CPU&#39;s) the job runs on single processor and it is stopped in the other. Actually I clarified that the error is not with CHARMM. Is there any error in my MPI procedure? I gave the job run as<br>
<br>mpirun -hostfile hosts -np 2 charmm &lt; *.inp <br>Thanks for any help.<br>Varsha.<br>
