Hi OMPI Community.<br><br><br>Is there any thought process to extend GCC support to OpenMPI or implementation of OpenMPI specification in GCC for C, C++ &amp; Fortran and making it generally available for platforms which supports POSIX.<br>
<br>Can GCC community think extending a support library for OpenMPI in it&#39;s releases.<br><br>BR<br>Mukesh <br>
