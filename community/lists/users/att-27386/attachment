<div dir="ltr"><div>We&#39;ve been struggling with this error for a while, so hoping someone more knowledgeable can help!</div><div><br></div><div>Our java MPI code exits with a segfault during its normal operation, <b>but the segfault occurs before our code ever uses MPI functionality like sending/receiving. </b>We&#39;ve removed all message calls and any use of MPI.COMM_WORLD from the code. The segfault occurs if we call MPI.init(args) in our code, and does not if we comment that line out. Further vexing us, the crash doesn&#39;t happen at the point of the MPI.init call, but later on in the program. I don&#39;t have an easy-to-run example here because our non-MPI code is so large and complicated. We have run simpler test programs with MPI and the segfault does not occur.</div><div><br></div><div>We have isolated the line where the segfault occurs. However, if we comment that out, the program will run longer, but then randomly (but deterministically) segfault later on in the code. Does anyone have tips on how to debug this?
