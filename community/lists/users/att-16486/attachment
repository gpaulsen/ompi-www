Jeff is correct. The Intel environmental variables are either set in /etc/profile or /user/.bashrc (or manually). Root sets its own environmental variables and therefore the key is to make sure that the environmental variables are set before an installation as root is done, i.e.:<BR>
<BR>
source /opt/intel/Compiler/11.1/073/bin/ifortvars.sh intel64 <BR>
source /opt/intel/Compiler/11.1/073/bin/iccvars.sh intel64<BR>
<BR>
Then the rest of the procedure can follow.<BR>
<BR>
It sounds simple and it is, perhaps <BR>

Make all gets the same environment as make install (assuming you do it in the same shell). But if you sudo make install, the environment may be different - it may not inherit everything from your environment. 

I advised the user to &quot;sudo -s&quot; and ten setup the compiler environment and then run make install.

&gt; Tim,
&gt; 
&gt; I certainly do not expect anything special, just normally &quot;make
&gt; install&quot; should not have issues, if &quot;make&quot; passes fine, right? What we
&gt; have with OpenMPI is this strange difference: if ./configure CC=icc,
&gt; &quot;make&quot; works, and &quot;make install&quot; - does not; if ./configure
&gt; CC=/full/path/to/icc, then both &quot;make&quot; and &quot;make install&quot; work.
&gt; Nothing needs to be searched, icc is already in PATH, since
&gt; compilevars are sourced in profile.d. Or am I missing something?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; didn't find the icc compiler
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; Jeff, on 1.4.3 I saw the same issue, even more generally: &quot;make
&gt;&gt;&gt; install&quot; cannot find the compiler, if it is an alien compiler (i.e.
&gt;&gt;&gt; not the default gcc) - same situation for intel or llvm, for example.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The workaround is to specify full paths to compilers with CC=...
&gt;&gt;&gt; FC=... in ./configure params. Could it be &quot;make install&quot; breaks some
&gt;&gt;&gt; env paths?
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Most likely reason for not finding an installed icc is that the icc
&gt;&gt; environment (source the compilervars script if you have a current version)
&gt;&gt; wasn't set prior to running configure.  Setting up the compiler in question
&gt;&gt; in accordance with its own instructions is a more likely solution than the
&gt;&gt; absolute path choice.
&gt;&gt; OpenMPI configure, for good reason, doesn't search your system to see where
&gt;&gt; a compiler might be installed.  What if you had 2 versions of the same named
&gt;&gt; compiler?
