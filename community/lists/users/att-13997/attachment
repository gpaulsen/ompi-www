      <div>I'm no expert on compiler vs lib confusion, but some of my

    Hi Ralph, I believe the clean and rational solution when an MPI
    Application needs a specific combination of OMPI and Intel Compilers
    is to just build this OMPI against that compiler version statically
    or dynamically so the application can just use it. I feel that the
    OMPI libs + run-time is intimate part of the run-time of the
    application. What people think they can do is to build only ONCE
    against the same OMPI but freely swap in and out any Intel library
    run-time w/o worries and without REBUILDING the application. Nothing
    in life is free though.<br>
    Thanks for the reply .... <br>

              <br>
              we have deployed OpenMPI 1.4.1 and 1.4.2 on our Intel
              Nehalem cluster using Intel compilers V 11.1.059 and
              11.1.072 respectively, and one user has the following
              request:<br>
              <br>
              Can we build OpenMPI version say O.1 against Intel
              compilers version say I.1 but&nbsp; then built an application
              with OpenMPI O.1 BUT then use a DIFFERENT Intel compiler
              version say I.2 to built and run this MPI application?<br>
              <br>
              I suggested to him to 1) simply try to built and run the
              application with O.1 but use Intel compilers version I.X
              whatever this X is and see if it has any issues. <br>
              <br>
              OR 2) If the above does not work, I would build OpenMPI
              O.1 against Intel version I.X so he can use THIS
              combination for his hypothetical application. <br>
              <br>
              He insists that I build OpenMPI O.1 with some version of
              Intel compilers I.Y but then at run time he would like to
              use <b>different</b> Intel run time libs at will I.Z
              &lt;&gt; I.X. <br>
              <br>
              Can you provide me with a suggestion for a sane solution
              to this ? <span class="moz-smiley-s1"><span> :-) </span></span><br>
              <br>
              Best regards<br>
