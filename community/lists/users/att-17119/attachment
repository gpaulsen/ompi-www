Dear Group,<div><br></div><div>I have a mpi-program in which every process is communicating with its neighbors. When SELF-checkpointing, every process writes to a separate file.</div><div>Problem is that sometimes after making a checkpoint, program does not continue again. Having more number of processes makes this problem severe.</div><div>With just 1 process (no communication), SEFL-checkpointing works normally with no problem.</div><div>I have tried different '--mca btl' parameters (openib,tcp,sm,self), but problem persists.</div><div>I would very much appreciate your support regarding it.</div><div><br></div><div>Kind regards,</div><div>Faisal</div> 		 	   		  </div></body>
