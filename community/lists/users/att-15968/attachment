Thank you guys for information.<BR>
<BR>
I don;t know from where I should start. This is my first experience using OpenMPI. Is there any simple calculation using my 2 laptops? <BR>
Please if there is very very simple tutorial for dummies...<BR>

I'd like to point out that nothing special needs to be done because
you're using a wireless network. As long as you're using TCP for your
message passing, it won't make a difference what you're using as long as
you have TCP/IP configured correctly.

&gt; My favorites are at the NCSA web site; if you get a free account, you can login and see their course listings.

&gt;&gt; Dear All,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I am newbie in parallel computing and would like to ask.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have switch and 2 laptops:
&gt;&gt; 	&#8226; Dell inspiron 640, dual core 2 gb ram
&gt;&gt; 	&#8226; Dell inspiron 1010 intel atom 1 gb ram
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Both laptop running Ubuntu 10.04 under wireles network using TP-LINK access point.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I am wondering if you have tutorial and source code as demo of simple parallel computing for  2 laptops to perform simultaneous computation.
&gt;&gt;
