hi <br>I want to create datatypes of the form<br>XX000000...<br>00XX0000...<br>0000XX00...<br>etc.<br><br>I tried MPI_Type_indexed(1, ais, ait, MPI_SHORT, &amp;dtNewType)<br>where ais= {2} and ait = {2} but this only gives me a datatype of the form
<br>00XX, i.e. no holes at the end.<br><br>I guess MPI_Type_vector won&#39;t work, because there seems to be<br>no way to create holes at the beginning of the datatype<br>

<br><br>I need these datatypes to let each process write its data into the file<br>in the following way:<br>XXYYZZXXYYZZXXYYZZ....<br>(X is data from proc 0, Y is data from proc 1,&nbsp; Z is data from proc 2)<br><br>My intended approach was to define&nbsp; datatypes of the form XX0000, 00XX00, 0000XX
<br>for the respective processors, and then&nbsp; call&nbsp; MPI_File_set_view<br>with displacement 0 and the respective datatypes fo the &quot;filetype&quot; parameter,<br>and finally let each&nbsp; processor write its stuff to file sequentially using MPI_File_write.
<br><br>However, my plan failed since i am unable to create datatypes with holes in front and at the end.<br><br>What function should i use to create the desired datatypes?<br><br>Thank You<br><br>&nbsp; Jody <br>
