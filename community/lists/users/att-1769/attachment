Hi there,<br>I'm using openmpi-1.1 on a linux-amd64 machine and also a linux-32bit x86 chroot environment on that same machine.<br>(distro is gentoo, compilers: gcc-4.1.1 and gcc-3.4.6)<br><br>In both cases openmpi-1.1 shows a +/-400MB overhead in virtual memory usage (virtual address space usage) for each MPI process.
<br><br>In my case this is quite troublesome because my application in 32bit mode is counting on using the whole 4GB address space for the problem set size and associated data.<br>This means that I have a reduction in the size of the problems which it can solve.
<br>(my aplication isn't 64bit safe yet, so I need to run in 32bit mode, and use effectively the 4GB address space)<br><br><br>Is there a way to tweak this overhead, by configuring openmpi to use smaller buffers, or anything else ?
<br><br>I do not see this with mpich2.<br><br>Best regards, <br clear="all"><br>-- <br>Miguel Sousa Filipe
