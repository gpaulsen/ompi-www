Hi,<br><br>In an effort to make a Qt gui using MPI, I have the following:<br><br>1. Gui started in master node.<br><br>2. In Gui, through a pushbutton, a global variable x is assigned some value; let say, x=1000;<br><br>3. I want this value to be know to all nodes. So I used broadcast in the function assigning it on the master node and all other nodes.<br>
<br>4. I printed values of x, which prints all 1000 in all nodes.<br><br>5. Now control has reached to MPI_Finalize in all nodes except master.<br><br>Now If I want to reassign value of x using pushbutton in master node and again broadcast to and print in all nodes, can it be done??<br>
I mean, can I have an MPI function which through GUI is called many times and assigns and prints WHILE program is running.<br><br>OR simply can I have a print function which is printing noderank value in all nodes whenever pushbutton is pressed while program is running.<br>
<br>command i used is &quot;mpirun -np 3 ./a.out&quot;. <br><br>Any help will be appreciated.<br>Thanks you very much.<br><br>--<br>eye51 <br>
