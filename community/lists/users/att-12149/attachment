Hi All,<br><br>I&#39;m facing a strange problem with OpenMPI. <br><br>I&#39;m developing an application which is required to send a message from each client  (1 MB each) to a server node for around 10 times per second (it&#39;s a distributed render application and I&#39;m trying to reach a higher frame rate ). The problem is that OpenMPI crash in that case and only works if I partition this messages into a set of 20 k sub-messages with a sleep between each one of them for around 1 to 10 ms!! This solution is very expensive in term of time needed to send the data.  Is there any other solutions? <br>
<br>The error i got now is:<br>Signal: Segmentation fault (11)<br>Signal code:  Address not mapped (1)<br>Failing at address: xxxxxxxxxxxxx<br><br>The OS is Linux CentOS.  I&#39;m using the latest version of OpenMPI. <br>
<br>I appreciate any help regarding that.<br><br> Regards,<br>Amr<br>
