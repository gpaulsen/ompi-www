Dear all,<br><br>I have been able to install open mpi on two
independent machines having FC 10. The simple hello world programms are
running fine on the independent machines....But can any one pls help me
by letting me know how to connect the two machines and run a common
program between the two....how do we a do a lamboot -v lamhosts in case
of openmpi?<br>
How do we get the open mpi running on the two computers simultaneously and excute a common program on the two machines.<br><br>Thanks in advance<br clear="all"><br>-- <br>Ankur Pachauri.<br>09927590910<br><br>Research Scholar,<br>
