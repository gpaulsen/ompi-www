<html><body  bgcolor="#ffffff">I am looking for the basic steps for setup of an MPI cluster on a RHEL or Fedora system with mpi-1.1.<br>IBM used to have a tutorial on this but I cannot find a complete one now.<br>I have 3 white box computers which I would like to setup and run basic programs on and start working with MPI. <br>I currently plan to just set them up on a gigabit network.&nbsp; All three are dual core if that makes a difference and I might get another one which is quad core in the near future.<br>I have found quite a few books on programming but not very much on the setup.&nbsp; Judging by the size of the tutorial that was on IBM site someone has done a good job of making this simple and easy, but I haven't found the basic information on where to setup information on nodes and the like.<br><div><font face="Verdana" size="2"></font></div>
