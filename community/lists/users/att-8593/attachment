<br>
I do not understand the reason you would forward the request (as a request) to another function. The data is already in a specific receive buffer by the time an MPI_Test returns TRUE so calling the function and passing it the buffer address,  and tag seems functionally equivalent.   If the called function needs information from the MPI_Status (beyond tag) returned by MPI_Test  you can pass it the status you get back.   The MPI_Status is in application managed memory so the function can do whatever you like with it after it has referenced it for the data.<br>
<br>
malloc a status<br>
MPI_Test<br>
if (flag == TRUE)<br>
   call function passing the status structure // use tag info from status to pick the function &amp; let the function free the status<br>
<br>
<br>
If you do pass the un-deallocated request, remember your function must still MPI_Wait it.<br>

&gt; If an MPI_Irecv has already been posted, and a single message is sent <br>
&gt; to the receiver, then will an MPI_Probe return that there is no <br>
&gt; message waiting to be received? The message has already been received <br>
&gt; by the MPI_Irecv. It's the MPI_Request object of the MPI_Irecv call <br>
&gt; that needs to be probed, but MPI_Test has the side effect of also <br>
&gt; deallocating the MPI_Request object.<br>
&gt; <br>

&gt; &gt;&gt; Is there a function similar to MPI_Test that doesn't deallocate the <br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; MPI_Request object? I would like to test if a message has been <br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; received (MPI_Irecv), check its tag, and dispatch the MPI_Request to <br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; another function based on that tag.<br>
