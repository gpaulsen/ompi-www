Dear all,<br><br>Now I am studying the openib component, and I find it is really complicated. Here I have one question to ask,&nbsp; it is as follows:<br><br>In the initialization of openib component, the function named setup_qps() is used. In this function, the following code segments are written:<br><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; mca_btl_openib_component.num_pp_qps = num_pp_qps;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mca_btl_openib_component.num_srq_qps = num_srq_qps;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mca_btl_openib_component.num_xrc_qps = num_xrc_qps;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mca_btl_openib_component.num_qps = num_pp_qps + num_srq_qps + num_xrc_qps;</b><br>if you run the program in the step way, you will find that at last the value of mca_btl_openib_component.num_qps is 4( the value of num_pp_qps is 1, and the value of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; num_srq_qps is 3).&nbsp; Can someone explain me why 4 QPs(1 normal QP, 3 SRQ QPs) need to be created?<br><br><br>Have a nice day!<br>Thanks very much!<br><br>best regards,<br>Jie<br> 		 	   		  </body>
