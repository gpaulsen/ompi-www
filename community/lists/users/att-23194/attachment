<div dir="ltr">Hi<div><br><div>In OpenMPI, are MPI_Send, MPI_Recv (and friends) implemented using rendezvous protocol or eager protocol?</div><div><br></div><div>If both, is there a way to choose one or the other during runtime or while building the library?</div>

<div><br></div><div>If there is a threshold of the message size that dictates the protocol to be used, is there a way I can alter that threshold value?</div><div><br></div><div>If different protocols were used for different versions of the library in the past, could someone please direct me to the exact version numbers of the implementations that used one or the other protocol?</div>

<div><br></div><div>Thanks a lot,</div><div>Siddhartha</div></div></div>
