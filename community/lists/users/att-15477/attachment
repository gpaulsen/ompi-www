I wouldn't say that this is true.  We test across a wide variety of OS's and compilers.  I'm sure that there are particular platforms/environments that can trip up some kind of problem (it's happened before), but in general, Open MPI is pretty portable.

Not at all.  Others have said it, but I'm one of the developers and I'll reinforce their answers: I regularly have about a dozen different installations of Open MPI on my cluster at any given time (all in different stages of development -- all installed to different prefixes).  I switch between them quite easily by changing my PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH (both locally and on remote nodes).

    Not to be a lone descenting opinion here is my experience in doing
    the above.<br>
    <br>
    First if you are always recompiling your application with a specific
    version of OMPI then I would agree with everything Jeff said above.&nbsp;
    That is you can build many versions of OMPI on many linux versions
    and have them run.<br>
    <br>
    But there are definite pitfalls once you start trying to keep one
    set of executables and OMPI binaries across different Linux
    versions.<br>
    <br>
    1.&nbsp; You may see executables not be able to use OMPI libraries that
    differ in the first dot number release (eg 1.3 vs 1.4 or 1.5
    branches).&nbsp; We the community try to avoid these incompatibilities as
    much as possible but it happens on occasion (I think 1.3 to 1.4 is
    one such occasion).<br>
    <br>
    2.&nbsp; The system libraries on different linux versions are not always
    the same.&nbsp; At Oracle we build a binary distribution of OMPI that we
    test out on several different versions of Linux.&nbsp; The key here is
    building on a machine that is essentially the lowest common
    denominator of all the system software that exists on the machines
    one will be running on.&nbsp; This is essentially why Oracle states a
    bounded set of OS versions a distribution runs on.&nbsp; An example of
    this is there is a component in OMPI that was relying on a version
    of libbfd that changed significantly between Linux version.&nbsp; Once we
    got rid of the usage of that library we were ok.&nbsp; There are not "a
    lot" of these instances but the number is not zero.&nbsp; <br>
