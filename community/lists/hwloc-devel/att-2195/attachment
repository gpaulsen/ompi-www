    <span style="white-space: pre;">&gt; Ah, that might explain it,
      then.<br>
      &gt;<br>
      &gt; I guess this means we need to add a few configure tests to
      figure out the dependencies of libpci (if any). Yuck.<br>
      &gt;<br>
      &gt; Do we have any idea what function in libpci is calling the
      resolver functionality?<br>
    </span><br>
    If you pass PCI_LOOKUP_NETWORK to the name-lookup functions (we
    don't), pci_id_net_lookup() gets called and it does a DNS-like
    resolving. No idea how it works.<br>
