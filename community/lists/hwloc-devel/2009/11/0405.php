<p>Great, thanks! I don't have access to any Suse or Fedora machine
<br>
unfortunately so I can't help much. I think it'd be good to have RPMs
<br>
for Redhat5 and Centos as well. But I have no idea how to build RPM
<br>
packages. Should your spec file work for most RPM-based distro? Is there
<br>
a basic how-to for building RPM with such a spec file?
<br>
<p>I see that Open MPI has .src.rpm files on its download pages. Should we
<br>
consider doing the same for hwloc?
<br>

<p>Good to know :)
