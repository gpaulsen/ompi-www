I already use git-svn for most of my hwloc work. But I still need svn for backports, and that wastes a lot of my time.<br>

<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap:break-word; font-family: monospace; margin-top: 0px">We're having a discussion (again :-) ) about moving OMPI to a DVCS.<br /><br />The short conclusion of the long conversation is: the OMPI dev community would be much more comfortable moving to a DVCS if they could see some success with other OMPI projects (e.g., hwloc and/or MTT).<br /><br />Would hwloc be interested in moving to git?  This would mean:<br /><br />1. converting the existing svn to git<br />--&gt; including all historical log messages that refer to "rXXXX"<br />2. converting the existing trac to git<br />--&gt; including all trac tickets, comments, and wiki pages that refer to "rXXXX"<br /><br />The OMPI devs -- who are mostly unfamiliar with git -- would like to see some close-to-home successes with git over a period of time that don't require heavy administrative maintenance over time (one of the pushback issues was that some organizations have hired full-time people to
maintain/fix git repositories when they break/become unusable).<br /><br />Interested?<br /></pre></blockquote></div></body></html></body></html>
