Hi Samuel,<br><br>I got a crash course on s390.<br><br>The main goal of the guys around emerging Fedora&#39;s s390 distribution is to have as many packages as possible available for s390 to avoid dependency problems. They are trying to port all x86_64 packages to s390. They do it even for packages which are not particuarly usefull on s390. And this seems to be the case with hwloc.<br>
<br>They have an access to mainfraim with 18 CPUs and 128 GB of RAM. However, the mainframe is usually divided into the smaller partitions ( LPAR) on which virtual machines are running.<br><br>In this particular case they have tested hwloc on the virtual machine running on partition with 2GB of RAM and 4 CPUs of which only 1 was online. This is certainly not a typical use-case for hwloc. Nevertheless, great news is that hwloc is running just fine on this box! :-)<br>
<br>FYI, s390 does not support NUMA (to answer the question I have posted here:-) )<br><br>For completeness I have attached output of hwloc-gather-topology as well in case somebody would like to have a look.<br><br>Thanks<br>

<div class="im">&gt; I would like to check out if hwloc supports IBM&#39;s s390 architecture.<br>
<br>
</div>Hwloc&#39;s support on Linux is mostly linux-dependant. With the /sys stuff<br>
being hardware-independant, it should in principle &quot;just work&quot; on s390,<br>
provided the s390-specific part announces proper things in /sys. We<br>
don&#39;t have our own s390, so we couldn&#39;t test. The Debian s390 testboxes<br>
only announce 2 processors, so there&#39;s not much topology to discover<br>
there, but it basically works, announcing the 2 processors :) I wonder<br>
what would be discovered on bigger machines. In any case, if you have<br>
any chance of running gather-topology on such beast, let us know :)<br>
