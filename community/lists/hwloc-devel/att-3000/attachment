    Marwan (CC'ed) is working on adding interoperability between OpenGL
    displays and hwloc. The idea is that you can get the locality of the
    GPU that handles a screen so as to place rendering tasks on the CPUs
    nearby. This would be used in <font color="#000099"><a
        href="http://www.equalizergraphics.com/">http://www.equalizergraphics.com/</a>&nbsp;
      for instance.</font><br>
    <br>
    The code is available at<br>

    We discussed this recently in private. Here's what I think is worth
    being noted:<br>
    * The code currently only works NVIDIA GPU's but Marwan thinks the
    API could be ported to AMD too.<br>
    * The code uses NVIDIA's apparently-open-source nvctrl library. The
    lib is unfortunately only built as a static lib in at least debian
    and ubuntu (without -fPIC), which is annoying. So Marwan would like
    to bundle it inside hwloc. I don't think that's a good idea for
    maintenance and portability reasons (assuming copyrights are okay)
    but I am open to opinions.<br>
    * We get new "display" objects in the topology<br>
    * We also get some new helpers that convert between displays and
    cpusets<br>
    <br>
    There's still some work/cleanup before this can be merged<br>
    * His institution should sign the contributor licensing agreement<br>
    * Some functions likely need renaming/prefixing<br>
    * We need to cleanup the proposed API (make the busid an actual
    generic PCI bus id, find good function names and filenames, make
    sure display_info is ok, ...)<br>
    * We need to check where the current X model is going with displays
    and multiple GPUs. Dave Airlie is working on sharing memory objects
    between GPUs (to switch between integrated and discrete GPUs) so we
    could have multiple GPUs for a single X display. We need to make
    sure we won't have problem if we can ever port the new API to such
    cases.<br>
