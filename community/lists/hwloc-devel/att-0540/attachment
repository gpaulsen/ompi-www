Re make check - I know it exists, but it was difficult to integrate the embedded test in with the existing &quot;check&quot; target because the embedded test effectively needs a full hwloc tarball to compile against. I played with making a sym link from tests/embedded to ../.. And using that as the test's &quot;tarball&quot;, but that runs into problems when you run the test's autogen because it re autogens the entire tree (not just the embedded test).<BR>
So at least for the moment, it is a separate, manual test.<BR>
