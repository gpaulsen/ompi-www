<div>&gt; I&#39;ve run this test  before (didnt keep the results but can run it again).<br>
&gt; I got debug output and compared it with the output from a hwloc test<br>
&gt; executable<br>
&gt; and I noticed that my program did not show any PU objects were discovered.<br>
&gt; In my program the first discovered topology is just a Machine object,<br>
&gt; but in the hwloc program its a Machine object and 64 PU objects.<br>
&gt; something went wrong in PU detection...<br>
<br>
</div>If I am reading your output correctly, all PUs are created by<br>
setup_pu_level() depending on the return value of<br>
hwloc_fallback_nbprocessors() defined in src/topology.c. Any chance you<br>
add some printf there to understand what&#39;s going on?<br>
hwloc_fallback_nbprocessors() would likely return 64 when things work<br>
and 0 otherwise here.<br>
