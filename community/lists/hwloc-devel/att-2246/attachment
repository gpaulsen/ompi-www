Hi Brice,<br><br><div class="gmail_quote"><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;"><div class="im">&gt; Well, this is interesting. numactl --hardware shows the number of<br>

&gt; hops, regarding to the information from that private BZ.<br>
<br>
</div>I think this is wrong. numactl takes everything from sysfs as far as I<br>
can tell. On x86, sysfs distances are ACPI SLIT latencies (memory<br>
latencies that are normalized to 10 for latencies from one cpu to its<br>
local memory). A couple months ago, I checked all Linux ports that show<br>
distances in sysfs. All of them report memory latencies, except the SGI<br>
IP27 as mentioned previously (this one indeed shows number of hops (0<br>
when local) and it makes a lot of sense for this architecture).<br></blockquote><div><br>Yes, you are absolutly right. Sorry about it. It&#39;s better to check some sources than to rely on my own memory:-) <br></div><div>

One problem I see with the number of hops is that it doesn&#39;t make sense<br>
on some machines. On some 8-socket AMD machines (such as<br>
8amd64-4n2c.tar.bz2 below) , the hypertransport route between some<br>
sockets varies with the type of packet (response or request) and the<br>
direction. So the number of hops ends up being asymmetric, depends on<br>
read/write, and can be half of an integer.<br></blockquote><div> </div><div>Yes, this is exactly what I have seen as well. This even true for 4 socket AMD Magny Cours system. <br><br> </div><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); padding-left: 1ex;">

Look at tests/linux/ in the hwloc SVN. The following tarballs contain<br>
NUMA architectures. Some of these were gathered while running old<br>
kernels, but I don&#39;t think it matters because Linux/sysfs reports what<br>
the BIOS without changing much of it.<br></blockquote><div><br>I will. The thing is that I&#39;m pretty bu\sy right now, I need to finish a project before going on vacation. I hope to look into in September. <br></div><div>
