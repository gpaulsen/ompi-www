1. Drop --log and --phys; only have --verb<BR>
2. Print phys as an attribute; print lots more phys's with --verb<BR>
3. I don't have much of an opinion wrt gui output, but it should be consistent with all the other flavors of output<BR>

&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; I played with this today and arrived to these conclusions:<BR>
&gt; * Having 'l' or 'p' prefix without # or any other special character is<BR>
&gt; very confusing since we already have things like L1 for cache levels and<BR>
&gt; P for proc numbers<BR>
&gt; * Having nothing before the number is a bad idea, it would be confusing<BR>
&gt; with cache/misc levels<BR>
&gt; * I like '#' as a prefix since it's widely used as a symbol meaning<BR>
&gt; &quot;number&quot; and I found no other nice character<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt; So I see two solutions:<BR>
&gt; * p#2 and l#2 (prefixed with a space)<BR>
&gt; [...]<BR>
&gt; * #2p and #2l<BR>
&gt; [...]<BR>
<BR>
I am asking people here, some are confused by all these<BR>
--logical/--physical outputs. One idea that came is to always keep the<BR>
logical index and print the physical index as an attribute. Something like:<BR>
<BR>
$ lstopo -<BR>
Machine(1508MB) + Socket#0 (phys=0) + L2(phys=0,2048KB)<BR>
&nbsp; L1(phys=0,32KB) + Core#0(phys=0) + P#0(phys=0)<BR>
&nbsp; L1(phys=1,32KB) + Core#1(phys=1) + P#1(phys=1)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I am interested by this idea. The physical index could actually be<BR>
displayed as an attribute for Proc all the time since it's often<BR>
interesting. The physical index of other objects is often useless and<BR>
even confusing.<BR>
<BR>
So what about we:<BR>
1) keep --logical by default, add physical index in Proc attributes by<BR>
default<BR>
2) if --verbose, we add the physical index in every object attribute<BR>
3) if --physical, we replace #0 with physical indexes as #0p (and don't<BR>
print logical indexes anywhere)<BR>
I would actually just drop (3). If we really need --physical to match<BR>
other tools command-line options, we could just make --physical<BR>
equivalent to --verbose.<BR>
