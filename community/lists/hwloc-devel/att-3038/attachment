    If we're going to install two lstopo binaries with different names,
    we need good names now (instead of plugin trolls).<br>
    <br>
    I think I would vote for lstopo (no X/cairo) and
    lstopo&lt;suffix&gt; so that completion helps.<br>

      We recently got some complains from redhat/centos users that
      wanted to install hwloc on their cluster but couldn't because it
      brought so many X libraries that they don't care about.

      Debian solves this by having two hwloc packages: the main hwloc
      one, and hwloc-nox where cairo is disabled. You just install one
      of them, packages are marked as conflicting with each others.

      I asked Jirka, our fellow RPM hwloc packager. He feels that RPM
      distros don't work that way. They usually have a core 'foo'
      package without X, and something such as 'foo-gui' with the
      X-enabled binary. So you'd have lstopo and lstopo-gui installed at
      the same time.
      <br>
      <br>
      I don't have any preference but RPM is much more widely used than
      deb in HPC, so we must consider the issue, either in hwloc or in
      RPM packaging. And we need a solution that is consistent across
      distros (we don't want users to get lost because Debian/Ubuntu
      lstopo is graphical while RPM lstopo is not and lstopo-gui is).
      <br>
      <br>
      It's not hard to build two lstopo binaries in the same hwloc
      (quick patch attached). But we'd need to decide their names
      (lstopo/lstopo-nox, lstopo/lstopo-nogui, lstopo-gui/lstopo), and
      find a good way to make the existing packages deal with them.
      <br>
      <br>
      How do people feel about this? Is it ok to choose between hwloc
      and hwloc-nox packages on Debian/Ubuntu? Does somebody want to
      *always* have a lstopo-nox installed? Should the default lstopo be
      graphical/cario or not?
