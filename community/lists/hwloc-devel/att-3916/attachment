The only branch that didn&#39;t have any tags at all was master, so I just created a &quot;dev&quot; tag on master, and that was sufficient.</blockquote><div><br></div></div><div class="gmail_quote">Right, we plan to use the gitflow model in which master contains released code and a &quot;develop&quot; branch serves the role of the svn trunk or cvs head as the target for 99% of commits.  Since as I understand it, &quot;git describe&quot; counts from the most recent tag, if we used git describe for tarballs we probably apply a tag to the develop branch which names the upcoming release.  Perhaps &quot;v1.7.3devel&quot;.</div>

That being said, when we tell users to get a nightly tarball (e.g., to get a bug fix), my experience is that they don&#39;t know/care about the nightly tarball numbering scheme: they always just get the most recent version.</blockquote>
</div><br><br>The advantage isn&#39;t only for the user.</div><div class="gmail_extra">When somebody reports &quot;I found a bug when trying nightly tarball &lt;whatever&gt;.tar.gz&quot; it seems useful to me to (without leaving my email client) know &quot;that was 8 days ago and I *know* we fixed &lt;blah&gt; since then&quot;.  With just a hash I am likely to defer my response until I have a moment to correlate the hash to a date.  This is NOT a big deal, just an observation that having the date in the filename makes talking about &quot;it&quot; more meaningful.</div>
