        Hello Terry,<br>
        <br>
        Indeed there's nothing like this as of today. We talked about it
        in the past but it's not very easy to implement on Linux (see
        below) so we forgot about it until somebody complained.<br>
        <br>
        Adding infos would certainly be fine. I think it should rather
        be "CPUType" and "CPUModel" since existing infos have no
        underscore in their name if I remember correctly. You could also
        set object-&gt;name to a combination of type and model. Socket
        looks like the right object to put this. Maybe even use "Model"
        and "Type" as the info names then?<br>
        <br>
        The reason it's not easy on Linux is that we usually take infos
        from either sysfs, or /proc/cpuinfo if sysfs isn't available,
        but not from both. Processor names are only in /proc/cpuinfo
        IIRC. So we'd need to mix sysfs and /proc/cpuinfo. Not easy with
        the current code, especially if you can't assume that all
        sockets are similar. But definitely something that I will do at
        some point.<br>

      The way info objects would be attached to a Socket object I assume
      it would be ok to just attach such an object under Solaris but not
      not for the other OSes.  Since one can look for the named object
      and it is either going to be there or not :-).<br>

    Yes.<br>

      Anyway, I'll play around with this for Solaris.  Can I then email
      you the diff for a review?<br>
