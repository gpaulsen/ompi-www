&gt;&gt; I am not sure. The object structure contains a father pointer. We use<BR>

&gt; FWIW, the english word &quot;parent&quot; definitely refers to the immediate ancestor.&nbsp; It does *not* refer to grandparents or great-grandparents, etc.<BR>

<BR>
Since we modified quite a lot of things in the API between 0.9 and 1.0,<BR>
we probably could fix this as well, ie:<BR>
* use parent instead of father everything<BR>
* use ancestor instead of parent when not talking about the immediate<BR>
ancestor<BR>
