Hi all,<br><br>I have come across tests/hwloc_distances test and I believe that it would be great to convert this into the utility &quot;hwloc-report-instances&quot; published under utils/ directory. Please let me know what you think about it. <br>
<br>It would take the same input as hwloc-info (read topology from different formats instead of discovering the topology on the local machine), support both logical and physical indexes (-l and -p) switch.<br><br>I have used stream memory bandwidth benchmark (<a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/stream/">http://www.cs.virginia.edu/stream/</a>) in the past to produce the similar output as tests/hwloc_distances. It was interesting to see that numactl and kernel scheduler are both using number of hopes instead of memory bandwidth. On some systems number of hops does not represent memory bandwidth. I have reported this in BZ 655041<br>
<br><a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=655041">https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=655041</a><br><br>In any case I believe that hwloc-report-instances would be useful utility. Please let me know your opinion.<br>
<br>Thanks<br>Jirka<br>
