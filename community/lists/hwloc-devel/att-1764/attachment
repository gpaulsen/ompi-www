Hello,<br><br>I would like to check out if hwloc supports IBM&#39;s s390 architecture. I have been using hwloc on i386, x86-64 and ppc so far only. <br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S390">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S390</a><br>
<br>Fedora is about to support s390 and somebody has tried to build hwloc on s390. There are several issues like missing numactl-devel and numactl packages on s390. ( I don&#39;t know if s390 itself supports NUMA or if just these packages are missing).<br>
<br>In the first place I would like to check with you if hwloc supports s390 and s390x arch.<br><br>Thanks a lot!<br>Jirka<br><br><br>
