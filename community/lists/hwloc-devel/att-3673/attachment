    If I remember correctly, NVIDIA or AMD proprietary drivers cannot
    use the kernel sysfs API because it's GPL-only. They can't create
    devices in sysfs, that's why hwloc doesn't get any GPU OS device
    with NVIDIA.<br>
    <br>
    card* and controlD64 is what we get with opensource DRM drivers that
    use the sysfs/drm kernel API. But I don't expect people to do much
    with them as long as there's no way for an application to know if
    it's using card0 or card1. That's why there's a NVIDIA specific
    plugin using NVCtrl: you give a display such as :0.0, it returns the
    locality of the PCI device running it.<br>

      <pre wrap="">The short answer to this may be that my Nvidia driver is too old. My Nvidia
card is old so I have to use the version 173 proprietary driver on it, but the
latest nouveau driver works fine.

I'm on Fedora 18, testing hwloc-1.7. I fetched and built the latest
libXNVCtrl, 319.17, from <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="ftp://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/nvidia-settings">ftp://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/nvidia-settings</a>.
The one shipped with Fedora is too old and hwloc will not build with it.

When I have the nvidia proprietary driver installed, it does not show as an OS
device. Here's the end of the tests/hwloc_iodevs output:

Found 3 OS devices
 Found OS device em1 subtype 2
 Found OS device sda subtype 0
 Found OS device sr0 subtype 0

with the open-source nouveau driver loaded, it looks like this:

Found 5 OS devices
 Found OS device card0 subtype 1
 Found OS device controlD64 subtype 1
 Found OS device em1 subtype 2
 Found OS device sda subtype 0
 Found OS device sr0 subtype 0

The card0 and controlD64 objects have no infos associated with them.

There are no other differences in the output. Both drivers seem operational.
I've attached the gather-topology output (created with the nvidia driver
loaded) in case anyone wants to see it.

thanks,
