This is unfortunately not the case on the box we have at INRIA:

lgrp 0 has 0 children

while there are two cores on the machine.

That may be due to the version of Solaris you have installed.&nbsp; I am not
sure if any of the S10 updates have these premade lgroups.&nbsp; Can you
tell me what S10 update you are running.<br>

If there was assurance that there is a lgrp for them, yes, but
apparently it's not always true.

Actually, what would more helpful would be access to some big solaris
machine, as we (INRIA) currently don't even have access to a NUMA
solaris machine.

I have access to some of these types of machines internally.&nbsp; I believe
all of the larger ones are SPARC based.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there is no way
I can get you access to them since they are development machines behind
our firewall and our policy does not allow for such.<br>
<br>
Is there a set of tests you would like me to run for you? <br>
