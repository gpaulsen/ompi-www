Jeff Squyres, le Mon 11 Jan 2010 11:31:12 -0500, a &#233;crit :
<br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; That's what I was trying to say in my first mail -- the text that is now hwloc.7in overlaps what is currently in hwloc.doxy (*some* text overlaps; some does not).  I.e., hwloc.7in and hwloc.doxy intersect; one is not a subset of the other.  It would take some additional work to merge the two sets of content into a single set that could be included in both places.
</span><br>
<p>Yes, but I think it could be useful to do it.
<br>
<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt; I was assuming that the PDF was a high-level doc and the man pages were lower-level.
</span><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt; As such, I'm personally ok with the way the information is currently laid out.
</span><br>
<p>Ok, I'll see.  At least having a common hwloc.7 is already a better
<br>
thing :)
<br>
<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt; (I would object to simply including hwloc.7 as a standalone PDF chapter without any merging into the existing text, however)
</span><br>
<p>Sure :)
<br>
<p>Samuel
