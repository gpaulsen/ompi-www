<p>That's what I was trying to say in my first mail -- the text that is now hwloc.7in overlaps what is currently in hwloc.doxy (*some* text overlaps; some does not).  I.e., hwloc.7in and hwloc.doxy intersect; one is not a subset of the other.  It would take some additional work to merge the two sets of content into a single set that could be included in both places.
<br>
<p>I was assuming that the PDF was a high-level doc and the man pages were lower-level.  Hence, it was ok for the PDF to say less things than them man pages (i.e., fewer details) -- which is more-or-less what it is now.  As such, I'm personally ok with the way the information is currently laid out.  But I would not object if you merged the two existing text sections together and made it so that there was only one common chunk of text that is included in both the PDF and hwloc.7.  :-)  
<br>
<p>(I would object to simply including hwloc.7 as a standalone PDF chapter without any merging into the existing text, however)
