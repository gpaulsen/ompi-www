<span class="quotelev1">&gt; hwloc-ps lists all processes currently running on the machine with their corresponding binding according to the hwloc topology.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; And the man page says:

<span class="quotelev1">&gt;         hwloc-bind - List currently running processes and their binding.

<span class="quotelev1">&gt; (obvious typo there s/hwloc-bind/hwloc-ps/ -- I'll fix)
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; ...leading me to believe that hwloc-ps shows *all* processes and if any process is bound to something, it'll show what it's bound to.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;

<p>It shows all processes only if -a is given. Otherwise, only processes 
<br>
that are bound to something are shown.
