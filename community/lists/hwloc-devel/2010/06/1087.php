Samuel Thibault, le Thu 24 Jun 2010 18:28:18 +0200, a &#233;crit :
<br>
<span class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  depending on the type of machine you're running on.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; It also depends on the OS and kernel version for instance. Not all
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; information is available, the only you can bet on is PUs under a system
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; object. At worse there is just one because the OS didn't even say how
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; many there are.
</span><br>
<p>Also, it may be worth adding that you can't know whether some layer
<br>
might be introduced some day between cores and PUs, so the user
<br>
shouldn't assume the former being the direct father of the latter.
<br>
There might be groups of PUs for instance, for whatever reason
<br>
manufacturers invent in the future and that we will want to express.
