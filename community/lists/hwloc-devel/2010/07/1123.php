<p>Hello Samuel,
<br>
<p>Apologise if you receive several copies of this mail but I think the mail that
<br>
I sent yesterday was rejected.
<br>
<p>Thank you for your suggestions and for thinking about using Servet with hwloc.
<br>
<p>On the one hand, about the OS support, we know that there is a problem in the
<br>
current version of Servet but we had not noticed that it even does not work in
<br>
all LINUX systems. Thank you for your advice, we will try to add the Debian
<br>
support in the next version of Servet.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, we think that the idea of a library is fantastic and it
<br>
would be very interesting that hwloc could use it. I will start with the
<br>
development of the library as soon as I could. Are you interested in all the
<br>
benchmarks or only in the caches ones? If you are only interested in the cache
<br>
size and sharing I could create a first version only with these benchmarks to
<br>
provide you the library sooner.
<br>
<p>Maybe you even would like to ask something about the interface of the
<br>
library... in that case, we are very interested in your opinion...
<br>
<p>Best regards, Jorge.
