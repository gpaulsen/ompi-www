Hello,
<br>
<p>Jorge Gonzalez Dominguez, le Tue 29 Jun 2010 08:30:58 +0200, a &#233;crit :
<br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; Apologise if you receive several copies of this mail but I think the mail that
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; I sent yesterday was rejected.
</span><br>
<p>I actually had bounced it to the list
<br>
<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt; On the one hand, about the OS support, [...]
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; Thank you for your advice, we will try to add the Debian
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; support in the next version of Servet.
</span><br>
<p>Actually it's probably not just Debian (which doesn't have patches for
<br>
that part of glibc), but mere newer versions of glibc.
<br>
<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt; On the other hand, we think that the idea of a library is fantastic and it
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; would be very interesting that hwloc could use it. I will start with the
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; development of the library as soon as I could. Are you interested in all the
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; benchmarks or only in the caches ones?
</span><br>
<p>We are mostly interested in whatever provides machine topology, i.e.
<br>
e.g. memory and cache sharing.  Cache size would be nice too.  We do not
<br>
(yet!) have use for plain memory bandwidth.
<br>
<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt; If you are only interested in the cache size and sharing I could
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; create a first version only with these benchmarks to provide you the
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; library sooner.
</span><br>
<p>I don't think it's really urging.
<br>
<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe you even would like to ask something about the interface of the
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; library... in that case, we are very interested in your opinion...
</span><br>
<p>Well, ideally (i.e. the easiest way to integrate into hwloc) such
<br>
library would for instance provide a way to iterate over all caches and
<br>
for each of them get its size and cpus using it.
<br>
<p>Samuel
