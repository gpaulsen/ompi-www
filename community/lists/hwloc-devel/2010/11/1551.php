Jeff Squyres, le Mon 22 Nov 2010 15:56:09 +0100, a &#233;crit :
<br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; Hmm, yes, this is a good topic.  I think we had this discussion a while ago
</span><br>
<p>Yes, we have, and we had thought p would be enough, but apparently it is
<br>
not.
<br>
<p><span class="quotelev1">&gt; -- using &quot;p&quot; is a good way to indicate &quot;physical&quot;.  But IIRC, we didn't like &quot;l&quot; (for &quot;logical&quot;) because it looks too much like 1 (one).  
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; I think we're open to having some kind of indication to denote &quot;logical&quot; instead of &quot;physical&quot; -- any suggestions?  Perhaps P and L (vs. p and l)?
</span><br>
<p>P/L can be better than p/l, yes. Just &quot;PU #0&quot; is indeed probably not
<br>
precise enough, and &quot;PU L#0&quot; will make people wonder why the L, and then
<br>
understand why.  I guess we can try to add this to an rc4.
