We could also print a message in stdout:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Using physical/OS indexes by default in the graphic mode, use -l to
<br>
revert to logical indexes&quot;
<br>
Anybody that may confuse logical/physical indexes will have to run
<br>
hwloc-calc/bind from a terminal anyway, so printing this lstopo message
<br>
to the terminal may help a bit? Otherwise, we could send the message to
<br>
the soundcard, or by mail, or print it in the sky like the batman signal :)
<br>
<p>I am not against printing something directly in the graphic output.
<br>
Cropping isn't hard indeed. We could even remove it when -s (silent) is
<br>
given, but -s already switches to text mode unfortunately.
<br>
<p>Anyway, FWIW, I think I am in favor of switching to physical in graphic
<br>
output by default.
