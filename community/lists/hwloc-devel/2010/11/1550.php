<p>Sorry; I was at SC10 last week and my INBOX fell into disrepair.  Brice is apparently much better at me on keeping up with email when at such things.  :-)

<p>Hmm, yes, this is a good topic.  I think we had this discussion a while ago -- using &quot;p&quot; is a good way to indicate &quot;physical&quot;.  But IIRC, we didn't like &quot;l&quot; (for &quot;logical&quot;) because it looks too much like 1 (one).  
<br>
<p>I think we're open to having some kind of indication to denote &quot;logical&quot; instead of &quot;physical&quot; -- any suggestions?  Perhaps P and L (vs. p and l)?
