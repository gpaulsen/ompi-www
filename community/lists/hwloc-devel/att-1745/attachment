Brice,<br><br>thanks for looking into it! <br><br>Regarding the naming. I would argue that since the utility is currently called <br>hwloc-gather-topology.sh<br>then the man page should be named<br>hwloc-gather-topology.sh.1<br>
<br>What&#39;s your opinion?<br><br>I have just one question regarding this code:<br>if [ -z &quot;$name&quot; -o x`echo $name | cut -c1` = x- ]<br><br>You code is definitely more portable than the code I have proposed. getopt might not be available on all systems. <br>
<br>Your code will give a usage message whenever -&lt;anything&gt; is used. Would not be better to use the case statement to check if<br>-h | --help has been used to give the usage message<br>-&lt;anything&gt; to check if invalid option has been entered and give: error message Unknown option and usage message<br>
Proceed otherwise.<br><br>This is how most program will work. <br><br>BTW, there are Bash&#39;s native commands to get a substring. ${string:position:length}. To get the first char just do<br>echo ${name:0:1}<br>See <a href="http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/string-manipulation.html">http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/string-manipulation.html</a><br>
<br>Also, is there any reason not have -h|--help officially documented in the man page?<br><br><blockquote style="margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); padding-left: 1ex;" class="gmail_quote">
There won&#39;t be any 1.1.1 release before a couple weeks obviously. So if<br>
you want to upload some RPM packages before 2011, you will have to patch<br>
1.1 anyway.<br></blockquote><div>Â </div><div>All right, once we agree on the proposed changes I will create rpm based on 1.1 with few patches.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Jirka<br></div><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Mon, Dec 20, 2010 at 8:50 AM, Brice Goglin <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:Brice.Goglin@inria.fr">Brice.Goglin@inria.fr</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br>

I have committed (locally) some changes that should address everything<br>
you reported and that are ok to backport in 1.1. I improved your manpage<br>
proposal too. See attached. By the way, I don&#39;t know if the manpage<br>
should be named .1 or .sh.1.<br>
