    &gt;Would that work?<br>
    <br>
    Nope, I tried to address that question in a comment in the patch.<br>
    The link succeeds and the problem only occurs when the executable is
    RUN.<br>
    So one would need AC_TRY_RUN; and then one has openned the&nbsp; the
    cross-compilation can-of-worms.<br>

      We could also AC_TRY_LINK a program that uses ffsfoo (the one that
      actually breaks here).<br>
      If it fails, we AC_TRY_LINK a program that uses ffsfoo with the
      __ffssi2() definition.<br>
      If it fails, we define NEED_FFS_FIX<br>
      And we just add the fix under #ifdef NEED_FFS_FIX in
      private/misc.h.<br>
      Would that work?<br>

          Making that happen is non-trivial because there are no
          preprocessor symbols defined by gccfss that would allow
          compile-time #if checks to distinguish gccfss from "vanilla"
          gcc.&nbsp; The only difference is in the string value of
          __VERSION__, which one could check at configure time. <br>

        Attached is a patch, relative to the svn trunk, which fixes this
        problem in my testing. <br>
        As I outlined above, the approach is two-fold: <br>
        1) Add configure-time logic to ID the buggy compiler <br>
        2) Restructure include/private/misc.h to include a
        HWLOC_HAVE_BROKEN_FFS case. <br>
        <br>
        Two things I'd like to note about the approach: <br>
        <br>
        + The configure-time logic is NOT trying to determine the
        version number, as I don't have a way (yet?) to pinpoint which
        version(s) work correctly, and the Oracle Forums thread on the
        subject doesn't say.&nbsp; So, it is conservatively assuming all
        "gccfss" versions are broken. <br>
        <br>
        + The misc.h changes are intentionally "generic" so one could
        add other configure time checks to define HWLOC_HAVE_BROKEN_FFS
        based on problems we've not yet discovered. <br>
