            <div style="">It is not quite as you describe because I was

            <div style="">The libtool.m4 logic that is&nbsp;distributed&nbsp;with

            <div style="">Unfortunately, that probe isn't smart enough
              to get the right answer on all Linux distros.</div>
            <div style="">So, the libtool.m4 from Fedora is the one I

            <div style="">Again: libtool in the official tarball of
              hwloc-1.7 does NOT do something as horrible as hardcode
              the wrong answer from the distro where one built the
              tarball (but it probably would it you built the tarball on
              Fedora).</div>

    Well, it's the same idea in the end. The libtool.m4 in the hwloc
    tarball is placed there by autoreconf, so it comes from the Debian
    machine where I generate the tarballs. I could generate official
    tarballs on Fedora to work around the issue (some nightly builds are
    generated this way, but not the official ones from the website
    (RHEL4 iirc).<br>

    That "somebody" is the person who opened this hwloc thread yesterday

    It's crazy that this hasn't been resolved earlier. Many projects may
    have the same problem. Maybe many of them ignore it because they
    build their tarballs on distros with a patched libtool.<br>
    <br>
    Anyway, we can't easily patch hwloc's libtool.m4 since we'd have to
    do that during autogen (after libtool.m4 gets copied), and the patch
    may fail against some versions of libtool. We could patch during the
    release tarball generation since we enforce the libtool version
    there, but I still don't fully like the idea.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Let's see if Jirka can work around the problem by autoreconfing
    during the RPM build and ping the libtool maintainers to finally fix
    this.<br>
