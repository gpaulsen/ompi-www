<P><FONT SIZE=2>Perhaps we should distinguish between memory in this object and memory that is accessible by this object...?<BR>
<BR>
I.e., cache and numa node can have x local memory. System/machine may have 0 local memory but (sum of children) accessible memory.<BR>
<BR>
Specifically:<BR>
<BR>
1 I think it is a common enough action to want to know how much memory there is on a machine/system that hwloc should do the sum.<BR>
<BR>
2 maybe local-kb can be an attribute of relevant objects, but total-kb can be an attribute of machine/system/whatever (i.e., anything that can have children that have local-kb). This keeps the values and meanings separate.<BR>

Subject: [hwloc-devel] memory size attributes<BR>
<BR>
Hello,<BR>
<BR>
While cleaning the System/Machine root types, I wondered what we<BR>
actually want to store in memory_kB attributes. It looks obvious for<BR>
Caches and NUMA nodes. But I am not sure about Machines and Systems.<BR>
<BR>
If we have a machine with 2 NUMA nodes, should the machine memory size<BR>
be the sum the sizes of both NUMA node sizes? Or should it be 0 since<BR>
the machine has no memory except in NUMA nodes? Same question for a<BR>
Kerrighed system assembling 2 machines.<BR>
<BR>
Then, if we have 1 Misc object grouping some NUMA nodes that are close<BR>
to each other: Should we store the total memory size of these nodes in<BR>
the Misc object attribute as well? We have the total memory size in the<BR>
NUMA node object (below misc) and in the machine object (above misc),<BR>
why not in Misc too? I am not saying that I want it, I am saying that<BR>
it's not very consistent.<BR>
<BR>
So I wonder if we should just not sum anymore and let the application do<BR>
the math when it actually needs the sum. A quick helper with<BR>
get_next_obj_by_type( ... NODE) would work.<BR>
<BR>
Or we need to document memory size attributes better:<BR>
* NUMA node: set of memory that can be accessed with the same access<BR>
time from other objects<BR>
* machine: set of cache-coherent memory, can be made of multiple NUMA nodes<BR>
* system: set of memory that is virtually accessible, but may not be<BR>
cache-coherent<BR>
<BR>
