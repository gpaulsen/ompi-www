<div dir="ltr">I know I&#39;m not really an active member of the dev community, but I have experience with this from working on TORQUE (my full-time job).

Take a look at svn2git. It takes care of some the the tag/branch naming problems. If you use it make sure to pass the --metadata option to get the git-svn-id&#39;s in the commit messages.<br>

&gt; When I switched Open-MX and KNEM from SVN to GIT, I basically just<br>
&gt; pushed my git-svn clone. But I had to manually convert some svn<br>
&gt; tags/branches. IIRC, the main reason is that git-svn has a strange way<br>
&gt; to name svn branches in git.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; We may also have to pass --authors-file to git svn clone so that SVN<br>
&gt; logins are converted into proper git author names.<br>

&gt;&gt; Ok.  This is kinda what I assumed your response would be.  :-)<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Let me talk to Dave Goodell later today, who just recently went through converting MPICH from SVN -&gt; Git, and see what kinds of things we need to do to get the ball rolling here, and what kinds of dragons we should expect to encounter along the way.<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt; I already use git-svn for most of my hwloc work. But I still need svn for backports, and that wastes a lot of my time.<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt; We&#39;re having a discussion (again :-) ) about moving OMPI to a DVCS.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; The short conclusion of the long conversation is: the OMPI dev community would be much more comfortable moving to a DVCS if they could see some success with other OMPI projects (e.g., hwloc and/or MTT).<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Would hwloc be interested in moving to git?  This would mean:<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. converting the existing svn to git<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; --&gt; including all historical log messages that refer to &quot;rXXXX&quot;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. converting the existing trac to git<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; --&gt; including all trac tickets, comments, and wiki pages that refer to &quot;rXXXX&quot;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; The OMPI devs -- who are mostly unfamiliar with git -- would like to see some close-to-home successes with git over a period of time that don&#39;t require heavy administrative maintenance over time (one of the pushback issues was that some organizations have hired full-time people to<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt; maintain/fix git repositories when they break/become unusable).<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Interested?<br>
