    Hello Terry,<br>
    <br>
    Indeed there's nothing like this as of today. We talked about it in
    the past but it's not very easy to implement on Linux (see below) so
    we forgot about it until somebody complained.<br>
    <br>
    Adding infos would certainly be fine. I think it should rather be
    "CPUType" and "CPUModel" since existing infos have no underscore in
    their name if I remember correctly. You could also set
    object-&gt;name to a combination of type and model. Socket looks
    like the right object to put this. Maybe even use "Model" and "Type"
    as the info names then?<br>
    <br>
    The reason it's not easy on Linux is that we usually take infos from
    either sysfs, or /proc/cpuinfo if sysfs isn't available, but not
    from both. Processor names are only in /proc/cpuinfo IIRC. So we'd
    need to mix sysfs and /proc/cpuinfo. Not easy with the current code,
    especially if you can't assume that all sockets are similar. But
    definitely something that I will do at some point.<br>

      I wanted to verify that I am not overlooking something, but is
      there any information stored in the hwloc topology tree that
      contains the CPU Model and Type of chips in a machine?  The
      closest I came was the Machine "Architecture" info object. 
      Unfortunately this object is not specific enough so I am
      considering adding a couple info objects (CPU_Model and CPU_Type)
      to the HWLOC_OBJ_SOCKET objects or maybe to the Machine object in
      topology_solaris.c in the OMPI hwloc source base.  <br>
      <br>
      First does that make sense and secondly does this sound like it
      might be useful enough outside of OMPI that you'd want to buy back
      the changes?  There is similar data that can be gotten for Linux
      too.  Though I personally only need this for Solaris/SPARC
      systems.<br>
      <br>
      thanks,<br>
