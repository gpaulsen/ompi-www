Hi all,<br><br>I have update Fedora&#39;s rpm package to the version 1.2. Thanks for a great software! <br><br>I have one question regarding files:<br>doc/doxygen-doc/man/man3/hwlocality_distances.3<br>doc/doxygen-doc/man/man3/HWLOC_OBJ_TYPE_MAX.3<br>
<br>These files are missing in Makefile.in in doxygen-doc. It seems like they have been forgotten. Could you please confirm this? I can force them to be part of the final rpm by copying them during the %install stage of the rpmbuild process. Please let me know.<br>
<br>Thanks<br>Jirka<br>
