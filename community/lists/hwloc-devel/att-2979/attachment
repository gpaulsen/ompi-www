I&#39;ve run this test  before (didnt keep the results but can run it again).<br>I got debug output and compared it with the output from a hwloc test executable<br>and I noticed that my program did not show any PU objects were discovered.<br>
In my program the first discovered topology is just a Machine object,<br>but in the hwloc program its a Machine object and 64 PU objects.<br>something went wrong in PU detection...<br><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Thu, Mar 22, 2012 at 6:29 PM, Brice Goglin <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:Brice.Goglin@inria.fr">Brice.Goglin@inria.fr</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br>

&gt; I suspected this might be the reason, so I called &quot;nm&quot;<br>
&gt; with the static versions of the libraries their compiler wrappers<br>
&gt; link against and I could not find the term &quot;hwloc&quot; in the output.<br>
&gt; Is this a valid test?<br>

</div>If your hwloc is still compiled with debug enabled, you can rebuild/run<br>
your MPI program with it. You should get the huge verbose output on<br>
stderr as long as you call hwloc_topology_init() and load(). If you<br>
don&#39;t get anything, some other hwloc is used instead of yours.<br>
