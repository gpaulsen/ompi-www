Hello,<br><div class="gmail_quote"><br>I am trying out hwloc on a very early access Blue Gene /Q system.<br>I&#39;ve built hwloc from source and am running test programs that use it.<br>The most serious issue I&#39;m observing is that when MPI and hwloc<br>

are used in the same program, hwloc aborts with &quot;Topology became empty, aborting!&quot;.<br>This does not happen when only hwloc calls are made in the program:<br>then the topology can see all 64 PUs.<br><br>Please let me know if theres a hint of what could be causing it,<br>

where to post, and what info to provide.<br><br>Thanks,<span class="HOEnZb"><font color="#888888"><br>
