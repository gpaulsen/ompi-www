        Can't check the code right now, but a couple questions below.<br>

          One of the issues I had was that the Core IDs (as reported by
          Xen) are enumerated per socket rather than as an entire
          system.&nbsp; The purpose of "HACK - patch up cpu_to_core." in
          hwloc_get_xen_info() is to change the per-socket enumeration
          to being per system.<br>
          <br>
          Samuel believes that hwloc should be able to cope with
          duplicate core IDs with different cpusets, but if I attempt to
          do that, I get the following error:<br>
          <pre><i>****************************************************************************</i>

<i>* object (Core P#0 cpuset 0x30000003) intersection without inclusion!</i>
<i>* Error occurred in topology.c line 853</i>

<i>* Please report this error message to the hwloc user's mailing list,</i>

        I don't understand what's going on here. Can you post the list
        of PU/core/socket IDs that Xen reports so that I see what is
        unique and what is not?<br>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <br>
    I will get back to you with the exact ids from the problematic
    system.<br>

          I currently have a crazy idea for getting at the cache
          information.&nbsp; topology-x86.c has a lot of cpuid knowledge, and
          I have a proposed new hypercall which executes cpuid on a
          specific PU.&nbsp; Would it be possible (or indeed sensible) to
          parametrise the code in topology-x86.c to take a few function
          pointers for get/set binding information, and for the cpuid
          call itself?<br>
        </blockquote>
        <br>
        I don't see why we couldn't do that. Can you post an example of
        what the Xen cpuid hypercall prototype would be, so that I see
        how I need to change the x86 backend?<br>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <br>
    I have already (pre-emptively) started hacking on the code.&nbsp; I shall
    see if I can get an RFC patch ready, but I am intending to do it
    will very few changes to the cpuid code.<br>

          That way, the common x86 knowledge could be used correctly by
          the Xen component, while still keeping its current design.<br>
        </blockquote>
        <br>
        Is there anything that the current Xen backend supports and that
        wouldn't be feasible through x86 cpuid? The x86 component can
        already detect a lot of topology information, including
        cores/caches/sockets/NUMA. Maybe the NUMA node sizes?<br>
        <br>
        By the way, which architectures are supported by Xen aside of
        x86? Does Xen have topology information for them?<br>

    <br>
    Xen currently supports x86 and has experimental support for arm32
    and arm64.&nbsp; The information available from the current code is
    generic, should should JustWork even on the arm systems.<br>
    <br>
    It would certainly be interesting to see whether my current Xen code
    agrees with x86 cpuid's idea of the topology.<br>
