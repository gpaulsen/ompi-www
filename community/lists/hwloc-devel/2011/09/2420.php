I pushed the new minimalistic XML import/export implementation without
<br>
libxml2 to the nolibxml branch. If libxml2 is available, it's still used
<br>
by default. --disable-libxml2 or some env variables can be used for
<br>
force the minimalistic implementation if needed. The minimalistic implem
<br>
is only guaranteed to import XML files that were generated by hwloc
<br>
(even if libxml was enabled there).
<br>
<p>I also backported most of this to the new v1.2-ompi branch (required to
<br>
backport some other XML cleanups from trunk). This branch will now serve
<br>
as a base for Open MPI's embedded hwloc. The idea is to have a complete
<br>
v1.2 + nolibxml somewhere so that we can at least run make check (Open
<br>
MPI does not embed enough to run hwloc's make check).
<br>
<p>How do we proceed now? Can we have the OMPI guys test the new code soon?
<br>
Should I wait for their feedback before merging the nolibxml branch into
<br>
the trunk? I'd like to merge this in v1.3 too (and basically release rc2
<br>
as the actual first feature-complete RC), so getting feedback early
<br>
might be appreciated.
