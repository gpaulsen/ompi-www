<p>
I want to release 1.3.1 for christmas, so I'll do a 1.3.1rc1 on monday.
<br>
There are no critical fixes in there, but several changes that are
<br>
useful, so it's better to finally flush all these (some have been
<br>
waiting almost since the 1.3.1 two months ago).
<br>
<p>Additionally, some people want a multinode support release soon too and
<br>
I kind of promised it would arrive by the end of the year. So I'll start
<br>
polishing the v1.4 branch and do a first 1.4rc next week or so, so that
<br>
people can start playing with it.
<br>
<p>There are currently 3 tickets against v1.4:
<br>
#50 is about adding instruction caches
<br>
#41 wants conversion function between &quot;L2cache&quot;-like string and
<br>
(type,depth) and actual depth within the tree
<br>
#43 wants throughput matrices on the side of the existing latency matrices
<br>
None of this is ready, and there are still open questions in #50 and #43
<br>
so I intend to defer all these to v1.5 so that multinode support doesn't
<br>
wait too long.
<br>
