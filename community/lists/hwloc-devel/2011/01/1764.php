Hello,
<br>
<p>I would like to check out if hwloc supports IBM's s390 architecture. I have
<br>
been using hwloc on i386, x86-64 and ppc so far only.
<br>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S390">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S390</a>
<br>
<p>Fedora is about to support s390 and somebody has tried to build hwloc on
<br>
s390. There are several issues like missing numactl-devel and numactl
<br>
packages on s390. ( I don't know if s390 itself supports NUMA or if just
<br>
these packages are missing).
<br>
<p>In the first place I would like to check with you if hwloc supports s390 and
<br>
s390x arch.
<br>
<p>Thanks a lot!
<br>
Jirka
