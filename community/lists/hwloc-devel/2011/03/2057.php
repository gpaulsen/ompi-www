<br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; I was wondering about merging the I/O branch:
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; - people have not expressed what they want so much,
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; - but people will probably not until it's exposed more,
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; - it's really a useful thing, and works fine in our tests,
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; - I'd like to see it out :)
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</span><br>
<p>One thing that we didn't decide in the past is about having OS device
<br>
subtypes or not. A disk is currently an object with type OS_DEVICE and
<br>
attribute OSDEV_BLOCK, while a network interface has attribute
<br>
OSDEV_NETWORK. We talked about removing the attribute and just having
<br>
objects with types OS_DEVICE_BLOCK or OS_DEVICE_NETWORK. I am not a big
<br>
fan of this but I may have forgotten about the advantages.
<br>
<p>I'd like to see this branch released too, it has been in a branch for a
<br>
year and a half already. But I can't be sure it's ready yet. I wish we
<br>
had more feedback, but I don't expect much anymore. We should be
<br>
prepared to a long release candidate cycle :)
