<p>
I just purchased a couple of dual-core boxes for cluster hobby projects and
<br>
I was looking for an MPI Implementation to install when I ran across Open
<br>
MPI.  I was a bit let down that there was no documentation, until I saw the
<br>
FAQ and realized that it was pretty darn Awesome!  Anyway, here is my 3
<br>
cents...
<br>
<p>As someone who is semi-literate on the subject of MPI Implementations the
<br>
first thing I wanted was a Getting Started Guide. To figure out how
<br>
processes were launched on remote nodes? What was the format for the machine
<br>
file? What libraries did my applications need to link against? And so on and
<br>
so forth... As I stated before, the FAQ pretty much answered all of my
<br>
questions, but I was wondering if it might be instructive to generate a
<br>
&quot;Getting Started Guide&quot; as a starting point for future documents?  And if so
<br>
would it be helpful to have input from someone using Open MPI for the first
<br>
time?  (Before I get too jaded)
<br>
<p>If so I am willing to lend a hand.
<br>
<p>Regards
<br>
