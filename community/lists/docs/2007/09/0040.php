Ok. This really helps. As you can see, my understanding about what's 
<br>
going on with Open MPI needs refining. I wasn't sure if the MPI world in 
<br>
general was moving towards Open MPI as being the one-and-only MPI, or if 
<br>
this was a parallel development (no pun intended).
<br>
<p>So I need to mull all this over some more.
<br>
<p>My hope is that the MPI Forum folks will come out with a stand-alone MPI 
<br>
spec that doesn't rely on any previous versions.
<br>
<p>I did have a meeting with our local DITA expert here at Sun, and I'm now 
<br>
re-thinking this as a possible publication environment. It's too early 
<br>
in the development of DITA for us to rely on, and truly usable tools are 
<br>
not quite there yet.
<br>
<p>My next stop is to look at what the folks at OpenSolaris.org are using 
<br>
and report back.
<br>
<p>More later. Thanks.

<span class="quotelev1">&gt; Ah -- I think that there are 3 main topics here:
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; 1. Knowledge of the MPI spec itself (&quot;book knowledge&quot;)
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. Knowledge of how to write MPI applications (&quot;practical knowledge&quot;)
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; 3. Knowledge of how to use a particular MPI implementation, such as 
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; Open MPI (&quot;applied knowledge&quot;)
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; I assumed we were only talking about #3.  Per your discussion above, 
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm thinking that you also want to document #1 and #2.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; I think we don't want to replicate #1.  www.mpi-forum.org is The Bible 
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; and there is a larger group working on an update (MPI 2.1, etc.).  I 
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; think that those documents should stand alone by themselves.
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt;
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; #2 is usually covered by existing books and various tutorials on the 
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; net.  Someone cited the NCSA tutorial, which is one of my favorite to 
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; point newbies to, as well.  My $0.02 is that we can include some basic 
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; examples of MPI programming in this project, but the real focus should 
</span><br>
<span class="quotelev1">&gt; be #3: how do you use Open MPI itself.
