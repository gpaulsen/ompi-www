<p>No worries.  Most of us OMPI developers know each other fairly well  
<br>
because we talk on the phone and IM all the time, and we have a  
<br>
number of face-to-face engineering meetings throughout the year.  So  
<br>
we have a pretty good understanding of each other already -- the  
<br>
developer community is small enough that we can do that.
<br>
<p>This docs group seems like it will be a little different than that --  
<br>
it may be almost entirely virtual (a bunch of names/email addresses  
<br>
joined this list that I am unfamiliar with), so going the more- 
<br>
verbose-on-a-wiki route may be more desirable.
<br>
<p>Most of the developers are not involved in this docs group, so I  
<br>
think there's a lot of freedom here to do what works for  
<br>
documentation.  I'm taking the role of liaison back to the developer  
<br>
group (although there will likely be more over time -- there will  
<br>
definitely need to be some distinct/strong ties back to the developers).
<br>
<p>I think that at the beginning here, the main structures that are  
<br>
going to be inherited from the developer community are:
<br>
<p>- the OMPI 3rd party contribution form
<br>
- the use of SVN and trac
<br>
- the OMPI web site
<br>
<p>We might want to have a proposal or two floated here on the list for  
<br>
how we want to attack the docs and then have a teleconference to  
<br>
discuss them (I find that sometimes an hour's worth of discussion can  
<br>
save a week's worth of e-mail).  Just my $0.02...
