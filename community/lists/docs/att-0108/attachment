<div>Hi.<br>&nbsp;<br>Suggesting, if OMPI community&nbsp;can think&nbsp;for coming of OpenMPI Internals document.&nbsp;Though it&#39;s a deligent task but finally very helpful. Probably having an Internal document will certainly help developers of OpenMPI.<br>
&nbsp;<br>What one has to do - if one is thinking to come with OMPI Internals document to start with? Is there any link or project repository within OMPI to start working on OMPI Internals document.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Appreciate, if any one can suggest?<br>&nbsp;<br>BR</div>
