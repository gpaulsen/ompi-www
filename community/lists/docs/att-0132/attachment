Hi Guys,<br>I&#39;m really new in mpi. I&#39;ve created a small grid composed of virtual and real host.<br>grid01 real/Centos/(Open MPI) 1.2.5<br>grid03 virtual (xen)/Centos/(Open MPI) 1.2.5<br>grid04 virtual (vmware)/Centos/(Open MPI) 1.2.5<br>
<br>When I try to run a parallel job like this:<br>mpirun  -v -H grid01,grid04 -np 2  /mnt/ewd/mpi/fibonacci/fibonacci_mpi<br>The job run<br><br>If I try instead<br>mpirun  -v -H grid03,grid04 -np 2  /mnt/ewd/mpi/fibonacci/fibonacci_mpi<br>
or with all 3 nodes I get the error:<br><br>It looks like MPI_INIT failed for some reason; your parallel process is<br>likely to abort.  There are many reasons that a parallel process can<br>fail during MPI_INIT; some of which are due to configuration or environment<br>
problems.  This failure appears to be an internal failure; here&#39;s some<br>additional information (which may only be relevant to an Open MPI<br>developer):<br><br>  PML add procs failed<br>  --&gt; Returned &quot;Unreachable&quot; (-12) instead of &quot;Success&quot; (0)<br>
<br>Seems like there is something wrong between grid03, grid04.<br>But If I run the job indivdually on every host it runs without problem.<br><br>I can&#39;t understand what happens.<br>Any Ideas?<br>In attach all the details.<br>
But Does Exist a guide / howto configure and setup openmpi (not build) ?<br><br>Thanks<br>Alex<br>
