I just purchased a couple of dual-core boxes for cluster hobby projects and I was looking for an MPI Implementation to install when I ran across Open MPI.&nbsp; I was a bit let down that there was no documentation, until I saw the FAQ and realized that it was pretty darn Awesome!&nbsp; Anyway, here is my 3 cents...<br>
<br>As someone who is semi-literate on the subject of MPI Implementations the first thing I wanted was a Getting Started Guide. To figure out how processes were launched on remote nodes? What was the format for the machine file? What libraries did my applications need to link against? And so on and so forth... As I stated before, the FAQ pretty much answered all of my questions, but I was wondering if it might be instructive to generate a &quot;Getting Started Guide&quot; as a starting point for future documents?&nbsp; And if so would it be helpful to have input from someone using Open MPI for the first time?&nbsp; (Before I get too jaded)<br>
<br>If so I am willing to lend a hand.&nbsp; <br><br>Regards<br clear="all"><br>-- <br>Aquil H. Abdullah<br>Interactive Supercomputing<br><a href="mailto:aquil.abdullah@gmail.com">aquil.abdullah@gmail.com</a>
