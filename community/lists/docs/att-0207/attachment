<div dir="ltr">Hello,<div><br></div><div>I apologize for the long time away from this. Last semester was a bit insane here with my teaching load. I finally got some things cleared up and can start looking at this again. I gave this a try on a machine here and got mixed results. Part of the problem is that our local implementation of the submission system seems to be ignoring the host and hostfile specification and allocating nodes as it sees fit. </div>
<div><br></div><div>I will try to find another machine to test this on. I tried it on my desktop machine playing around with localhost versus the fully qualified domain name, but openmpi seems to be outsmarting me and recognizing that it is all the same ip address.</div>

&gt; Yeah, it never occurred to me to use both, but when I was double checking things on the Open MPI website I came across a blurb that said that when used together the behavior is different. The documentation said that if the names in the --host command are not contained in the host file then the mpirun command fails.<br>

<br>
</div>Correct.  We basically use the --host as a filter on the hostfile.  If the --host argument isn&#39;t a proper subset of the hostfile, OMPI errors.<br>
<div class="im"><br>
&gt; It was not clear if you do not use a fully qualified name in one but not the other how it would be handled.<br>
<br>
</div>I&#39;m not sure.  Like Ralph said, I *think* it works.  I *think* OMPI may actually resolve all names first, and then do comparisons/filtering with IP addresses.<br>
<br>
You might want to give it a whirl and see what happens...?<br>
