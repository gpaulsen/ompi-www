Hi<br><br>i have built a High Performance Computing Cluster, which uses 
MPI and Octave.  i used the PelicanHPC  for  the setup of my cluster. so
 am now trying to fine tune my cluster  for good/ efficient performance.
 <br><br>
i  started by doing benchmarks for overall system performance which involved using the standard HPL  Linpack. <br>now i want to do  subsystem performance benchmarking which could involve fine tuning the mpi.<br><br>my
 cluster is using the open mpi package. However am a bit confused and 
stuck on how to get started to tackle this objective of open-mpi tuning.<br>
<br>may u pliz advise and direct me.<br><br>Regards
