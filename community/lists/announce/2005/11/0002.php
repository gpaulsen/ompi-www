<p>
The Open MPI Team is pleased to announced the release of Open MPI 
<br>
version 1.0. &#160;An entirely new MPI implementation, Open MPI combines the 
<br>
strengths of several leading MPI projects, including LAM/MPI (Indiana 
<br>
University), FT-MPI (Innovative Computing Laboratory/University of 
<br>
Tennessee), LA-MPI (Los Alamos National Laboratory), and PACX MPI (High 
<br>
Performance Computing Center at Stuttgart).&#160; While incorporating the 
<br>
best ideas and technologies from these earlier implementations, new 
<br>
designs and continued research have evolved to make Open MPI a truly 
<br>
next-generation MPI-2 implementation.
<br>
<p>Based on a high-performance component architecture, Open MPI supports 
<br>
dynamic loading of plug-ins for flexible run-time configuration of key 
<br>
functionality. &#160;Network plug-ins include: shared memory, Ethernet, 
<br>
Infiniband, and Myrinet; native job launch plug-ins include: rsh/ssh, 
<br>
SLURM, PBS/Torque, BProc, and Xgrid.
<br>
<p>&#147;Multiple network plug-ins can be loaded and used simultaneously,&#148; said 
<br>
Andrew Lumsdaine, a co-principal investigator on the Open MPI project 
<br>
and director of the Open Systems Lab, part of Pervasive Technology Labs 
<br>
at Indiana University.  &#147;An application using Open MPI can therefore 
<br>
use any combination of supported network hardware, and it can use 
<br>
different hardware from run to run without ever having to be 
<br>
re-compiled.&#148;
<br>
<p>The flexibility provided by multiple network plug-ins also allows Open 
<br>
MPI to support network bonding, simultaneously using multiple network 
<br>
links to send messages between processes.
<br>
<p>The Open MPI architecture provides an ideal platform for active 
<br>
involvement by the HPC community.  Third party plug-ins can be 
<br>
incorporated into existing Open MPI installations, enabling even legacy 
<br>
applications to run with renewed functionality.&#160; For example, vendors 
<br>
can distribute enhancements and performance improvements in binary 
<br>
form. &#160;Researchers can develop new parallel algorithms and message 
<br>
passing techniques as plug-ins, thereby leveraging the full 
<br>
infrastructure of a production-quality MPI implementation.
<br>
<p>Open MPI was made possible with significant funding from the National 
<br>
Nuclear Security Administration&#146;s Advanced Simulation and Computing 
<br>
program.
