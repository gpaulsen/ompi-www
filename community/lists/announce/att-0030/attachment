The Open MPI Team, representing a consortium of research, academic,<br>and industry partners, is pleased to announce the release of Open MPI<br>version 1.3.2. This release is mainly a bug fix release over the v1.3.1<br>release, but there are few new features.  We strongly recommend<br>

that all users upgrade to version 1.3.2 if possible.<br><br>Version 1.3.2 can be downloaded from the main Open MPI web site or<br>any of its mirrors (mirrors will be updating shortly).<br><br>NOTE: The Open MPI team has uncovered a serious bug in Open MPI v1.3.0 and<br>

v1.3.1: when running on OpenFabrics-based networks, silent data<br>corruption is possible in some cases. There are two workarounds to<br>avoid the issue -- please see the bug ticket that has been opened<br>about this issue for further details:<br>

<br>    <a href="https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/ticket/1853" target="_blank">https://svn.open-mpi.org/trac/ompi/ticket/1853</a><br><br>We strongly encourage all users who are using Open MPI v1.3.0 and/or<br>v1.3.1 on OpenFabrics-based networks to upgrade to 1.3.2.<br>

<br><br>Here is a list of changes in v1.3.2 as compared to v1.3.1:<br><br>- Fixed a potential infinite loop in the openib BTL that could occur<br> in senders in some frequent-communication scenarios.  Thanks to Don<br> Wood for reporting the problem.<br>

- Add a new checksum PML variation on ob1 (main MPI point-to-point<br> communication engine) to detect memory corruption in node-to-node<br> messages<br>- Add a new configuration option to add padding to the openib<br> header so the data is aligned<br>

- Add a new configuration option to use an alternative checksum algo<br> when using the checksum PML<br>- Fixed a problem reported by multiple users on the mailing list that<br> the LSF support would fail to find the appropriate libraries at<br>

 run-time.<br>- Allow empty shell designations from getpwuid().  Thanks to Sergey<br> Koposov for the bug report.<br>- Ensure that mpirun exits with non-zero status when applications die<br> due to user signal.  Thanks to Geoffroy Pignot for suggesting the<br>

 fix.<br>- Ensure that MPI_VERSION / MPI_SUBVERSION match what is returned by<br> MPI_GET_VERSION.  Thanks to Rob Egan for reporting the error.<br>- Updated MPI_*KEYVAL_CREATE functions to properly handle Fortran<br> extra state.<br>

- A variety of ob1 (main MPI point-to-point communication engine) bug<br> fixes that could have caused hangs or seg faults.<br>- Do not install Open MPI&#39;s signal handlers in MPI_INIT if there are<br> already signal handlers installed.  Thanks to Kees Verstoep for<br>

 bringing the issue to our attention.<br>- Fix GM support to not seg fault in MPI_INIT.<br>- Various VampirTrace fixes.<br>- Various PLPA fixes.<br>- No longer create BTLs for invalid (TCP) devices.<br>- Various man page style and lint cleanups.<br>

- Fix critical OpenFabrics-related bug noted here:<br> <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/announce/2009/03/0029.php" target="_blank">http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/announce/2009/03/0029.php</a>.<br>
 Open MPI now uses a much more robust memory intercept scheme that is<br>
 quite similar to what is used by MX.  The use of &quot;-lopenmpi-malloc&quot;<br> is no longer necessary, is deprecated, and is expected to disappear<br> in a future release.  -lopenmpi-malloc will continue to work for the<br>

 duration of the Open MPI v1.3 and v1.4 series.<br>- Fix some OpenFabrics shutdown errors, both regarding iWARP and SRQ.<br>- Allow the udapl BTL to work on Solaris platforms that support<br> relaxed PCI ordering.<br>- Fix problem where the mpirun would sometimes use rsh/ssh to launch on<br>

 the localhost (instead of simply forking).<br>- Minor SLURM stdin fixes.<br>- Fix to run properly under SGE jobs.<br>- Scalability and latency improvements for shared memory jobs: convert<br> to using one message queue instead of N queues.<br>

- Automatically size the shared-memory area (mmap file) to match<br> better what is needed;  specifically, so that large-np jobs will start.<br>- Use fixed-length MPI predefined handles in order to provide ABI<br> compatibility between Open MPI releases.<br>

- Fix building of the posix paffinity component to properly get the<br> number of processors in loosely tested environments (e.g.,<br> FreeBSD).  Thanks to Steve Kargl for reporting the issue.<br>- Fix --with-libnuma handling in configure.  Thanks to Gus Correa for<br>

 reporting the problem.<br><br>
