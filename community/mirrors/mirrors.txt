# We *used* to have some Hebrew characters in this file, but they have
# been replaced with HTML encoding equivalents.  If this file ever
# contains non-US-english characters, you will need to SAVE THIS FILE
# WITH mule-utf-8 ENCODING!!  AND YOU WILL NEED TO EDIT THIS FILE WITH
# A mule-utf-8 CAPABLE EDITOR (e.g., carbon emacs on OS X).  Note that
# editing that entry may be tricky; do it in a GUI editor; I found
# that editing it in "emacs -nw" doesn't render right and makes
# editing quite difficult.

# This file lists the official mirror sites for the Open MPI web site.
#
# The format of each line in this file is:
#
#   Name!Region!Location!Flag image name!display [or not]!
#       Name of server!URL of mirror
#
# Name -- Name of the institution hosting the mirror
# Region -- Typically continent, but can be more fine grained if we want
# Location -- Typically a location and a country
# Flag image name -- Self explanitory, should be of the form flag-XX.gif
# Display -- 1 to show this entry in the official mirror list, 0 to not
#            show it (but still have the entry so that the mirror wget
#            will get the right flag and footer text)
# Name of server -- What is returned by PHP's $_SERVER["SERVER_NAME"],
#                   typically the hostname in the URL for the server
# URL of mirror -- Self explanitory
#
# Here's a good location for flags:
#   http://www.flags.net/
#
# Flag images should be 48x32
#
# Lines beginning with a "#" are comments
