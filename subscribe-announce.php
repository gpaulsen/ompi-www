<p>You will shortly receive an e-mail asking you to confirm the fact
that you want to receive announcements about <?php print($project); ?>
(i.e., confirm that you want to be on the "<?php print($list_name);
?>" mailing list on <code>open-mpi.org</code>).  Once you click on the
link included in the mail (or reply to the mail), you'll receive an
announcement e-mail whenever a new version of <?php print($project);
?> is available.

<P>Thanks for your interest in <?php print($project); ?>!
