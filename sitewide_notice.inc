<p> Open MPI's mailing lists have experiencing intermittent problems since approximately Thursday, August 23, 2018.  Many mails sent to the list have not yet been delivered.  <a href="https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/issues/5583">There is a problem with our listserver provider</a>; we're working with them to get the issue resolved.</p>

<p>If you sent a mail to any of our lists and it did not go through (i.e., it did not show up in the mail-archive.com archives), you should probably just wait.  Your mail <em>may</em> get delivered within a day or so once the listserve comes back.  If your mail is still not delivered to the list after a day after the listserver returns, you might as well re-send it.</p>

<p>Sorry for the hassle!</p>
