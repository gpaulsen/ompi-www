<p>Open MPI's Git repositories are hosted at <a
href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.</p>

<ol>

<li>First, you will need a Git client.  We recommend getting the
latest version available.  If you do not have the command
"<code>git</code>" in your path, you will likely need to download and
install Git.</li>

<li> <a href="https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi">ompi</a> is the
main Open MPI repository where most active development is done.</li>

</ul>


<li>Clone either of these repositories.  For example (as of October
2014), to clone the main development repository via HTTPS:

<?php print_code("<strong>shell$</strong> git clone https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi.git
Cloning into 'ompi'...
remote: Counting objects: 256644, done.
remote: Total 256644 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
Receiving objects: 100% (256644/256644), 61.98 MiB | 2.15 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (213377/213377), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
<strong>shell$</strong>"); ?>
</li>

<li>The web interface available by clicking on the above URL shows a
nice summary of recent activity and allows navigating into individual
commits.</li>

<li><font color=red>Once you have successfully cloned the repository,
continue on to the <a href="building.php">instructions on how to build
from a developer checkout</a>.</font></li>

</ol>

<p>Note that Git is natively capable of using many forms of web
proxies.  If your network setup requires the user of a web proxy,
<?php print("<a href=\"http://git-scm.com/\">"); ?>consult the Git
documentation for more details</a>.
