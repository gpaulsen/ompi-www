<p> <strong><font color="red">NOTE:</font></strong> Prior to October
2014, Open MPI was maintained in a Subversion repository.  This
Subversion repository had two read-only mirrors: a Mercurial mirror at
bitbucket.org and a Git mirror at github.com.  <em>These two mirrors
are now defunct</em> and will no longer be updated.  <strong> If you
are using either of these mirrors, you should stop using them and
switch to the main Open MPI Git repository at GitHub.</strong> </p>
